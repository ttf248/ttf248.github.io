        <description>&lt;p&gt;Accessing GitHub domestically is slow, and you can speed it up by configuring a proxy. There‚Äôs also another way: find a domestic hosting platform like CodeOcean or Coding. Configure the corresponding build pipeline to sync your code to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using ‚Äòcoding‚Äô for many years ‚Äì its interface is simple, and they recently released an announcement that the free version can no longer be used, requiring migration to Tencent‚Äôs new platform, &lt;code&gt;cnb&lt;/code&gt;.  Let me also complain a bit about Alibaba‚Äôs hosting platform; the entire interface design feels very dated/stuffy. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like eating a bowl of congee (Áè≠Âë≥ - ban wei)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cnb.cool/ttf248&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://cnb.cool/ttf248&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;repository-migration&#34;&gt;Repository Migration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;cnb&lt;/code&gt; website provides migration tools that can batch migrate code from &lt;code&gt;github&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;cnb&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.cnb.cool/zh/guide/migration-tools.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;git-proxy-configuration&#34;&gt;Git Proxy Configuration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid slow synchronization due to the lack of an accelerator, tools will first synchronize code to your local machine and then upload it to the remote repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git can be configured for HTTP proxies independently using the following commands, without affecting system-wide settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# Set HTTP proxy
git config --global http.proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080

# Set HTTPS proxy
git config --global https.proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080

# Optional: Configure proxy for a specific domain
git config --global http.https://github.com.proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remove the proxy configuration, use the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view your current proxy configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git config --global --get http.proxy
git config --global --get https.proxy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Prometheus Monitoring System Histogram and Summary</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/prometheus-monitoring-system-histogram-and-summary/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 19:00:28 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/prometheus-monitoring-system-histogram-and-summary/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Business systems designed monitoring metrics of type Summary, calculating the average duration: &lt;code&gt;request_duration_milliseconds_sum / request_duration_milliseconds_count&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the data, a particular interface was found to have very high average duration, and when examining the time series chart, the average duration suddenly increased ‚Äì effectively, one request took a long time, which pulled up the overall average.  The goal was to identify exactly when this request occurred, but due to the low number of requests within the period, the data retrieved remained empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;qa&#34;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;-why-does-_sum-and-_count-have-data&#34;&gt;‚úÖ Why does &lt;code&gt;_sum&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_count&lt;/code&gt; have data?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;_sum&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_count&lt;/code&gt; are the &lt;strong&gt;core metrics&lt;/strong&gt; of the Summary type, and Prometheus always collects and records these values;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are &lt;strong&gt;cumulative counters&lt;/strong&gt;, suitable for use with &lt;code&gt;rate()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;increase()&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regardless of request latency changes, as long as there are requests, &lt;code&gt;_sum&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_count&lt;/code&gt; will always have data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-why-quantile099-might-not-display-in-a-time-series-chart&#34;&gt;‚ùå Why &lt;code&gt;{quantile=&amp;quot;0.99&amp;quot;}&lt;/code&gt; might &lt;strong&gt;not display&lt;/strong&gt; in a Time Series Chart
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Summary is configured with &lt;code&gt;quantile=&amp;quot;0.99&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, this time series may not exist or be missing:
Metrics are definitely configured, and the data hasn&amp;rsquo;t expired. üìâ The request volume is too small, preventing quantile calculation, due to the sliding window mechanism; after this period of time, it will no longer be included in the statistical range.
Quantiles (such as p99) are calculated through sampling statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the request count over a certain period is too low (e.g., 1~2 requests), the calculation of p99 is &lt;strong&gt;unstable or lacks representativeness&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prometheus &lt;strong&gt;client SDK will choose not to expose this quantile time series&lt;/strong&gt; to avoid misleading;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, you&amp;rsquo;ll see &lt;code&gt;_sum&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_count&lt;/code&gt; accumulating normally, but &lt;code&gt;quantile=&amp;quot;0.99&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; has no data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;histogram-and-summary-differences&#34;&gt;Histogram and Summary Differences
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;histogram&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Histogram&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it Works:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A histogram will bucket data, recording the number of samples falling into each bucket.
For example, if buckets are defined as &lt;code&gt;[10ms, 50ms, 100ms, 500ms, 1s]&lt;/code&gt;, each request latency would be assigned to the corresponding bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can aggregate data from multiple instances (e.g., multiple service node request latencies) in Prometheus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suitable for calculating percentiles (such as P50, P95, P99) and observing latency distributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides flexible querying capabilities, supporting dynamic percentile calculation through PromQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires predefining the bucket range; an inappropriate choice can lead to uneven data distribution (e.g., all requests falling into one bucket).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more buckets you have, the greater the storage and computational overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suitable Scenarios:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregating data from multiple instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamically adjusting percentiles or analyzing latency distributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it Works:&lt;/strong&gt;
The Summary component calculates percentiles (such as P50, P95, P99) directly on the client and reports the results to Prometheus.
It also records the total number and sum of samples for calculating averages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not require predefined buckets, providing percentile results directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suitable for precise percentile calculations in single instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentile calculation is performed on the client side, preventing aggregation of data from multiple instances in Prometheus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjusting percentiles (e.g., changing from P95 to P99) requires modifying the code and redeploying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Cases:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single instance monitoring where precise percentile accuracy is a high priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When aggregation of data from multiple instances is not required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Histogram&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Summary&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;High (dynamically adjustable bins)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Low (requires code modification to adjust bins)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-1&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need to aggregate data from multiple instances or require flexible quantile adjustments, choose &lt;strong&gt;Histogram&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you only need the precise quantiles for a single instance and the quantiles are fixed, choose &lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your scenario, given that the service is distributed, it‚Äôs recommended to prioritize using &lt;strong&gt;Histogram&lt;/strong&gt; so that all instance data can be aggregated in Prometheus and dynamically calculate quantiles and distributions of latency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sliding-window-concept-and-its-relationship-with-histograms-and-summaries&#34;&gt;Sliding Window Concept and Its Relationship with Histograms and Summaries
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;sliding-window-concept&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sliding Window Concept&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sliding window is a time-windowing mechanism used to analyze changes in data over a period. It dynamically reflects the system&amp;rsquo;s real-time state by continuously moving a temporal range. The key characteristics of a sliding window are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed Time Range:&lt;/strong&gt; The length of the window is fixed, such as the last 1 minute or 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Time Updates:&lt;/strong&gt; As time passes, the window slides, old data is removed from the window, and new data is added to the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Uses:&lt;/strong&gt; Used for calculating real-time metrics (such as request rates, averages, percentiles, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Prometheus, sliding windows are typically implemented using query functions (like &lt;code&gt;rate()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;avg_over_time()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sliding-window-and-histogram-relationship&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sliding Window and Histogram Relationship&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Histogram Data Structure:&lt;/strong&gt;
A histogram will bin sample data and record the count for each bucket. Prometheus periodically scrapes these counts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sliding Window Implementation:&lt;/strong&gt;
In Prometheus, sliding windows can be applied to histogram data using query statements. For example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])&lt;/code&gt;: Calculates the request rate within each bucket over the past 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))&lt;/code&gt;: Calculates the 95th percentile of the request duration over the past 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sliding windows can dynamically reflect the recent request latency distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The binning mechanism of histograms combined with sliding windows allows for efficient calculation of percentiles and distributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sliding-window-and-summary-relationship&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sliding Window and Summary Relationship&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary Data Structure:&lt;/strong&gt;
Summary calculates percentiles directly on the client side and reports them to Prometheus. It also records the total sample count and sum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sliding Window Implementation:&lt;/strong&gt;
In Prometheus, sliding windows can be applied to Summary data using query statements. For example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) / rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m])&lt;/code&gt;: Calculates the average request duration over the past 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary percentiles are calculated on the client side and cannot be recalculated in Prometheus, therefore support for sliding windows with percentiles is limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sliding windows cannot directly operate on Summary percentiles when aggregating data from multiple instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sliding-window-applicability&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sliding Window Applicability&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-time Monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Sliding windows are suitable for monitoring system real-time status, such as request rates over the last minute and latency distributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anomaly Detection:&lt;/strong&gt;  By using a sliding window, it‚Äôs possible to quickly identify short-term anomalies (e.g., sudden increase in request latency).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Sliding windows can dynamically reflect changes in system trends rather than static global statistics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-2&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Histogram&lt;/strong&gt; combined with a sliding window can dynamically calculate percentiles (such as P95, P99) and request latency distributions, suitable for monitoring distributed systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt; combined with a sliding window can calculate simple metrics such as averages, but lacks flexibility regarding percentiles and does not support multi-instance aggregation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your scenario, due to the need to monitor extreme request latencies (such as P99) and the average latency of most requests, it is recommended to use &lt;strong&gt;Histogram&lt;/strong&gt; and combine it with a sliding window query to dynamically analyze system performance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog Translation Project Musings: Cultural Transmission, AI Programming</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-translation-project-musings-cultural-transmission-ai-programming/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 21:41:00 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-translation-project-musings-cultural-transmission-ai-programming/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Cultural Propagation: Its ideological influence, subtle and pervasive.
AI Programming: Not performing software design, resulting in a lot of rework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cultural-propagation&#34;&gt;Cultural Propagation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the project only supported English, Japanese, and Korean. Thinking it was just AI translation, we wondered if supporting more languages wouldn‚Äôt be a good idea. So, French, Russian, and Hindi were added. At this point, no problems were detected; when the program executed translations, formatting issues arose due to historical code problems, requiring re-translation of archived articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical timing reminders indicated that it would take nearly 20 hours to complete all translations, given that it was a large local model with 12b parameters. Considering reducing translation time, we deleted French, Russian, and Hindi. This is when things started to feel wrong ‚Äì why did I instinctively choose Korean and Japanese among the initially supported languages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to global population distribution, these two languages had relatively small audiences, especially Korean, which had approximately 80 million users worldwide. Japanese was slightly more prevalent, with around 1.2 billion people. In contrast, French, Russian, and Hindi had user populations exceeding 100 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we realized that the popularity of Korean and Japanese wasn‚Äôt due to the sheer number of language speakers, but rather the influence of cultural propagation. Korean and Japanese cultures have a wide-reaching impact globally, particularly in Asia. K-pop, anime, and television dramas attracted a large fanbase, leading these fans to naturally develop an interest in the corresponding languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at our growth history, I frequently watched Japanese anime and manga as a child, and later watched many Korean films and TV series. This led me to instinctively choose these familiar languages when setting up the project‚Äôs initial language settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;software-design-and-ai-programming&#34;&gt;Software Design and AI Programming
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial translation assistant was initially just a simple tool, but after experiencing Claude4‚Äôs coding capabilities, it gradually expanded its functionality, adding modules for article translation and tag translation. As the features increased, so did the code complexity. Although AI refactored the codebase to appear more organized, in expanding new functionalities or fixing bugs, AI-generated code often suffered from repetition issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI lacks a holistic understanding of overall structure and design principles when generating code. It typically modifies and extends existing code rather than effectively reusing existing modules, leading to redundant code. Manual cleanup of duplicate code is then required, which inadvertently increases development costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while AI-generated code is syntactically correct, it often suffers from problems in logic and design. For example, a slight adjustment to the prompt in another project resulted in completely different webpage structures lacking consistency. This reflects a lack of proper initial design, with new features added arbitrarily and haphazardly, leading to a chaotic codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also reminds us that core software engineering experience remains indispensable. A rational design not only reduces rework but also enhances code maintainability and extensibility. While AI is a powerful tool, it cannot replace human deep understanding and planning of systems.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog Translation Project Musings: Historical Conversations</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-translation-project-musings-historical-conversations/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 21:16:24 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-translation-project-musings-historical-conversations/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The initial design of the blog translation project was overly complex ‚Äì first parsing Markdown format, then using placeholders to protect the content, and finally sending it to a large model for translation. This was entirely unnecessary; large models inherently possess the ability to recognize Markdown syntax and can directly process the original content while maintaining formatting during translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work shifted from debugging code to debugging the &lt;strong&gt;prompting&lt;/strong&gt; of the model.
Model: &lt;code&gt;google/gemma-3-4b&lt;/code&gt;
Hardware: &lt;code&gt;Nvidia 3060 12GB&lt;/code&gt;
Indeed, we chose a non-thinking model ‚Äì thinking models were inefficient when executing translation tasks. We compared the performance of 4b and 12b parameters, and for translation purposes, gemma3‚Äôs 4b parameter was sufficient; there was no significant advantage in terms of 12b parameters.
12b parameter speed: &lt;strong&gt;11.32 tok/sec&lt;/strong&gt; , 4b parameter speed: &lt;strong&gt;75.21 tok/sec&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-introduction&#34;&gt;Background Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite adding various constraints within the &lt;strong&gt;system&lt;/strong&gt;, the output translation results still presented some issues, such as: lack of formatting protection, inclusion of extraneous explanatory content. When defining roles, it was already stated to protect Markdown format and only output translation results; ultimately, the translation remained unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I remembered encountering a comic translation project previously, which also leveraged the capabilities of large models. Its translation effect seemed better than mine. Upon reviewing the code and comparing the request data, the comic translation project would include a set of context with each request, in addition to the current translation content, it would also include previous translation content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What were the benefits? Not only did this improve the coherence between preceding and following translations, but it also ensured the stability of the output format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-historical-conversations&#34;&gt;The Importance of Historical Conversations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As large AI models (such as the GPT series, Claude, Gemini, etc.) become more prevalent, an increasing number of businesses and developers are accessing these models via APIs to build intelligent customer service, content generation, code assistant, and other applications. However, many people encounter a common issue during initial access: &lt;strong&gt;model outputs are disjointed, lack contextual understanding, and even answer the wrong questions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key reason for this phenomenon is ‚Äì &lt;strong&gt;not including historical conversation content in API requests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-history-dialogue&#34;&gt;What is a History Dialogue?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A history dialogue refers to the exchange records between a model and a user within a single conversation session. In most large language model APIs (such as OpenAI‚Äôs Chat Completions API), developers need to construct the complete &lt;code&gt;messages&lt;/code&gt; array themselves, passing the historical dialogue in turn as &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;assistant&lt;/code&gt; message format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;model&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;gpt-4&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;messages&amp;quot;: [
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Write me a resignation letter&amp;quot;},
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;assistant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Okay, what do you want to write about as the reason for your resignation?&amp;quot;},
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;I want to pursue personal career development&amp;quot;}
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you only send the last sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;I want to pursue personal career development&amp;quot;}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model won&amp;rsquo;t know you are writing a resignation letter, and its output quality will be very poor because it doesn‚Äôt understand the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-historical-dialogue-is-so-important&#34;&gt;Why Historical Dialogue is So Important?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-build-context-enhance-coherence&#34;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Build Context, Enhance Coherence&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI models are inherently ‚Äúcontext-driven.‚Äù They cannot remember anything that has happened ‚Äúpreviously,‚Äù unless you explicitly tell it. By passing in the dialogue history, the model can better understand your intent and topic context, resulting in outputs more aligned with expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-reduce-misunderstanding-rate&#34;&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Reduce Misunderstanding Rate&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want the model to complete a multi-turn instruction, such as writing, summarizing, or debugging code, historical context allows the model to gradually accumulate understanding and avoid going off-topic or losing focus midway through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-simulating-realistic-human-dialogue-behavior&#34;&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Simulating Realistic Human Dialogue Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical applications such as customer service systems, educational assistants, and health consultations, user questions often unfold gradually rather than being expressed clearly in a single instance. Preserving dialogue history allows the AI to behave more like a ‚Äúmemoryful assistant.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-correctly-add-historical-conversations-in-an-api&#34;&gt;How to Correctly Add Historical Conversations in an API?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s API as an example, we recommend following the structure below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;messages = [
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;You are a professional legal assistant&amp;quot;},
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;What are the essential conditions for a contract?&amp;quot;},
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;assistant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Contract validity requires fulfilling several conditions: ...&amp;quot;},
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Does an oral agreement count?&amp;quot;}
]

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model=&amp;quot;gpt-4&amp;quot;,
    messages=messages
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt; message to set the model&amp;rsquo;s behavior and identity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only retain recent key conversations, not necessarily the entire history (to avoid exceeding token limits).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In long sessions, truncate early content and maintain core information summaries to control token consumption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practical-recommendations&#34;&gt;Practical Recommendations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue State Management&lt;/strong&gt;: The backend needs to design caching mechanisms to record each user‚Äôs conversation history (e.g., Redis, database).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Length&lt;/strong&gt;: OpenAI GPT-4 has a context length of 128k tokens, Claude 3 can reach 200k~1M, and requires reasonable truncation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Summarization of History&lt;/strong&gt;: When the historical content is too long, use a model to first summarize the old conversations before adding them to the dialogue context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI large model capabilities are powerful, but developers need to ‚Äúfeed‚Äù it sufficient contextual information. &lt;strong&gt;By adding historical conversations within API requests, not only can the quality and coherence of the model‚Äôs output be significantly improved, but users can also experience a more natural and realistic conversation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you&amp;rsquo;re building AI customer service, writing assistants, coding helpers, or educational applications, this is an optimization technique that cannot be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/find-all-functions-not-referenced-in-the-go-project/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a Go language project, using &lt;code&gt;staticcheck&lt;/code&gt; to find unused functions is an efficient static analysis method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-install-staticcheck&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Install staticcheck&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that Go (version 1.16+) is installed, and then execute the following command to install &lt;code&gt;staticcheck&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-basic-usage-finding-unused-functions&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Basic Usage: Finding Unused Functions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run the following command in the project root directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;staticcheck ./...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Check Rules:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U1000&lt;/strong&gt;: Detects unused functions, methods, variables, or types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U1001&lt;/strong&gt;: Detects unused parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-filter-specific-check-rules&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Filter Specific Check Rules&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you only want to check unused functions, you can specify the rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;staticcheck -checks=U1000 ./...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-output-format&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Output Format&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Default output format is &lt;code&gt;{path}:{line}:{column}: {message}&lt;/code&gt;, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;main.go:10:2: func UnusedFunction is unused (U1000)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-configuration-file-optional&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Configuration File (Optional)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;.staticcheck.conf&lt;/code&gt; file in the project root directory to customize inspection rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;checks&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;U1000&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;-ST1000&amp;quot;]  // Enable U1000, disable ST1000 (string formatting rule)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a comment &lt;code&gt;//lint:ignore U1000 reason&lt;/code&gt; above the function to ignore the check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go&#34;&gt;//lint:ignore U1000 Used by generated code
func UnusedButNeeded() {}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;frequently-asked-questions&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How do I handle unused functions in test files?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A: &lt;code&gt;staticcheck&lt;/code&gt; defaults to checking test files. To exclude them, use the &lt;code&gt;-tests=false&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How do I integrate it into CI/CD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A: Add to GitHub Actions:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 20:57:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/the-zhejiang-financial-circle-collapsed-and-the-anti-corruption-efforts-over-the-past-two-years-have-not-been-limited-to-government-departments/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw a report on Douyin about an anti-corruption investigation in the Zhejiang financial sector. I had written about the prelude to financial corruption once before, but didn&amp;rsquo;t follow up on related reports afterward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still check financial news every day, and previously I rarely saw any reports about financial corruption. However, there have been increasing reports of financial corruption over the past two years, with more and more senior executives from banks, securities firms, and other financial institutions being investigated.
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain-rise/&#34; &gt;Financial Anti-Corruption Curtain Rise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent systemic anti-corruption storm in the Zhejiang financial sector is one of the most iconic events in China‚Äôs financial field in recent years. This anti-corruption campaign, which began in 2023, centered around the collective downfall of the former presidents of Zhejiang branches of four major state-owned banks, exposing long-standing issues of power abuse and collusion between government and businesses within local financial systems. The following outlines the event timeline, core problems, underlying causes, and subsequent impacts from four dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-event-timeline-from-the-zhu-xiaoyu-case-to-the-collapse-of-the-gang-leaders-of-the-four-major-banks&#34;&gt;I. Event Timeline: From the Zhu Xiaoyu Case to the Collapse of the ‚ÄúGang Leaders‚Äù of the Four Major Banks
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Spark: The Zhu Xiaoyu Case Unearths a Rotten Financial System Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In May 2023, Zhejiang Provincial Vice Governor Zhu Xiaoyu was investigated, and his corrupt pattern of &amp;ldquo;eating off finance&amp;rdquo; became a breakthrough point. During his tenure, he obtained massive profits through interfering in corporate IPOs and loans, and formed an alliance of interests with financial institution executives. In November 2023, Zhu Xiaoyu was expelled from the Communist Party and public office, and the numerous clues provided during the investigation directly triggered subsequent seismic events within the financial system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Corruption Storm Intensifies: Original Heads of Zhejiang Branches of the Four Major Banks Fall&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; Guo XinGang, the former Chairman of the China Bank‚Äôs Zhejiang Branch, was investigated. After retiring, he made money through low-priced property purchases and equity premiums, abusing his authority in mineral loan approvals, resulting in significant losses of state assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; Gao Qiang, the former Chairman of the Construction Bank‚Äôs Zhejiang Branch, was investigated. During his tenure, he illegally approved loans leading to multiple projects going bankrupt and receiving ‚Äúconsulting fees‚Äù exceeding tens of millions of yuan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; Feng Jianlong, the former Chairman of the Agricultural Bank‚Äôs Zhejiang Branch, voluntarily confessed, and during his tenure, he transformed the Zhejiang branch of the Agricultural Bank into a &amp;ldquo;family industrial business,&amp;rdquo; with relatives holding illegal positions and serious misconduct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 30, 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; Shen Rongqin, the former Chairman of ICBC‚Äôs Zhejiang Branch, was investigated. After retiring, he controlled institutions such as Changtang River Jinran Academy through ‚Äúpolitical rotation,‚Äù forming a network of interests with eight private enterprises.  Within 15 months, all the original heads of the four major banks&amp;rsquo; Zhejiang branches fell, creating a closed-loop anti-corruption effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory System Also Shakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In January 2025, Pan Guang‚Äôen, former Deputy Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee‚Äôs Financial Bureau, voluntarily confessed, using his privileged position to facilitate corporate equity reforms and investments, illegally receiving massive amounts of money. This marked a shift in the anti-corruption campaign from financial institutions to regulatory departments, revealing the deep entanglement of the ‚Äúregulatory-financial institution-private enterprise‚Äù three-party interest chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-core-issues-credit-corruption-and-rotating-door-interest-chains&#34;&gt;II. Core Issues: Credit Corruption and Rotating Door Interest Chains
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misappropriation of Lending Power: The Core Tool of Corruption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All four former heads of the major banks utilized their lending power to transfer interests: Guo XinGang violated regulations by issuing mineral loans, Gao Qiang manipulated credit through ‚Äúconsulting fees,‚Äù Feng Jianlong‚Äôs family-style lending led to bad debts, and Shen Rongqin used the Golden Research Institute platform to channel funds to related enterprises. Data shows that 68% of individuals investigated within the banking system in 2024 were involved in illegal lending or loan approvals, highlighting a deeply concerning loss of control over lending power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotational Corruption: Retirement is Not a Safe Deposit Box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All four individuals continued to wield power through ‚Äúidentity transformation‚Äù after retirement: Guo XinGang served as the president of an industry association to intervene in credit lending, Gao Qiang transitioned to a securities dealer director to manipulate capital, and Shen Rongqin established a ‚Äúfinancial-academic-research‚Äù platform to connect with private enterprises. This ‚Äúretire and continue‚Äù model allowed retired executives to evade regulation and form hidden interest chains. The 2024 Financial Anti-Corruption White Paper revealed that 68% of cases involved retired executives, with the Zhejiang case serving as a typical example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurred Boundaries Between Government and Business: Interest Transfer from Banks to Private Enterprises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Changtang River Golden Research Institute, led by Shen Rongqin, was established with investments from eight private enterprises including Zhentai and Chuanhua, ostensibly an academic institution but in reality a political-economic nexus. Through this platform, Shen Rongqin directed banking resources towards related enterprises, forming a ‚Äúbanking institution ‚Äì private enterprise think tank‚Äù binding model. Similar models were also evident in the cases of Guo XinGang and Gao Qiang, exposing the deep distortion of political-economic relations within local financial ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;three-root-causes-institutional-loopholes-and-regulatory-failures&#34;&gt;Three. Root Causes: Institutional Loopholes and Regulatory Failures
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Absence of Local Financial Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a major province for private economy, Zhejiang has been active in financial innovation, but the regulatory system hasn‚Äôt kept pace. Officials such as Zhu from Ju and Pan Guang&amp;rsquo;en have long dominated local financial policies, acting as both ‚Äúathletes‚Äù and ‚Äúreferees,‚Äù leading to ineffective regulation. For example, during his tenure at the Financial Bureau, Pan Guang&amp;rsquo;en illegally interfered in corporate financing and share reform, but was not effectively restrained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure of Internal Controls within Financial Institutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internal supervision mechanisms of the four major banks‚Äô Zhejiang branches were essentially empty. When Feng Jianlong served as the chairman of Zhejiang Branch of Agricultural Bank, his relatives quickly rose through the system, and the ‚Äúone-voice‚Äù credit approval phenomenon was prominent. Shen Rongqin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Employee Care Plan&amp;rdquo; ostensibly provided welfare, but actually consolidated power by controlling frontline employees to cover up corrupt behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak External Supervision Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enabling of cross-provincial investigations (such as the Shen Rongqin case being handled by the Liaoning Provincial Supervisory Commission) demonstrated that local protectionism had severely hindered anti-corruption progress. Furthermore, the complex equity relationships between financial institutions and private enterprises (such as half of the top ten loan customers of Zhejiang Merchants Bank were real estate companies) made risk transmission hidden, making traditional regulatory measures difficult to penetrate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;four-subsequent-impacts-regulatory-upgrading-and-industry-restructuring&#34;&gt;Four. Subsequent Impacts: Regulatory Upgrading and Industry Restructuring
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normalization of Anti-Corruption and Systemic Plugging of Leaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Provincial Supervision and Penetrating Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;: The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection adopted remote case handling to cut through local protection networks, and extended the scope of scrutiny from on-duty behavior to interest chains after retirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological Anti-Corruption Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;: Zhejiang piloted AI risk control models for credit approval, automatically identifying ‚Äúpeople-based loans‚Äù and ‚Äúpolitical-business loans,‚Äù effectively curbing corruption at its source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restrictions on Departing Executives&lt;/strong&gt;: Zhejiang Province is drafting the &amp;ldquo;List of Financial Executive Post-Employment Restrictions,&amp;rdquo; stipulating that bank chairpersons are prohibited from serving affiliated companies within three years after retirement, cutting off chains of power options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restructuring of the Financial Ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systemic Risk Clearance in Banks&lt;/strong&gt;: Institutions such as Zhejiang Business Bank and Hangzhou Bank were initiated internal restructuring due to the downfall of senior executives, and high real estate loan ratios (such as Zhejiang Business Bank‚Äôs real estate non-performing asset rate reaching 2.48%) forced business transformation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimization of Financing Environment for Private Enterprises&lt;/strong&gt;: Following anti-corruption actions, Zhejiang Province launched policies such as ‚ÄúZheke Loan,‚Äù providing 450 billion yuan in loans to 32,000 technology SMEs in 2024, driving finance back to its original purpose of serving the real economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Warning Effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The collective downfall of former branch managers of the four major banks in Zhejiang shattered the illusion of ‚Äúsafety after retirement,‚Äù conveying a signal of ‚Äúzero tolerance and no blind spots‚Äù in financial anti-corruption. This event also provides a mirror for the entire Chinese financial system: only by strengthening power constraints and improving regulatory systems can we safeguard financial security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the Zhejiang financial circle was fundamentally a concentrated outburst of long-term loss of control over local financial power. This storm not only cleared out a number of ‚Äúfinancial pests,‚Äù but also drove profound changes in regulatory models, institutional design, and industry ecosystems. In the future, how to balance financial innovation with risk management, and how to build ‚Äúclean‚Äù government-business relationships will continue to be subjects of ongoing exploration for Zhejiang and even the entire Chinese financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Git Submodule Merge History Lost</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-submodule-merge-history-lost/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 16:44:58 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-submodule-merge-history-lost/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a Git repository locally where submodules were in temporary branches during the initial pull. I made commits on that temporary branch, and then switched back to the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch. However, those committed changes seem to be lost and cannot be found within the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch. I also can&amp;rsquo;t find any record of that temporary branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions&#34;&gt;Solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After committing to a temporary branch within the Git submodule and switching back to the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch, these commits are no longer found. This situation can be resolved by following the steps below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verify Commit History&lt;/strong&gt;: Navigate to the submodule directory and use &lt;code&gt;reflog&lt;/code&gt; to find the lost commits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a New Branch to Save Commits&lt;/strong&gt;: Create a new branch based on the lost commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merge or Cherry-Pick Commits to Main&lt;/strong&gt;: Integrate the code into the main branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the specific steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# Enter the submodule directory
cd path/to/your/submodule

# View reflog records all HEAD changes (including commits not associated with branches)
git reflog

PS F:\dev\notebook\scripts\hugo-content-suite&amp;gt; git reflog
de05175 (HEAD -&amp;gt; main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from c8d070651310e90d283cb64d98da088c5fe05e73 to main
c8d0706 HEAD@{1}: commit: feat: Add Markdown tag symbol usage documentation, provide detailed syntax examples and effect display
48250f5 HEAD@{2}: commit: feat: Remove article translation preview function, simplify the translation process
b8280b6 HEAD@{3}: commit: feat: Add absolute path acquisition function, support converting relative paths to absolute paths
92c354b HEAD@{4}: commit: fix: Fix article scanning logic, ensure scanning using absolute paths
de05175 (HEAD -&amp;gt; main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) HEAD@{5}: checkout: moving from main to de05175d4ec0828e3ae95d726b09dfff18f67a23
de05175 (HEAD -&amp;gt; main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) HEAD@{6}: clone: from https://cnb.cool/ttf248/hugo-content-suite.git

# Create a new branch based on the lost commit (e.g., using 456def commit)
git checkout -b saved-work 456def

# Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the saved work into main (or use cherry-pick to select specific commits)
git merge saved-work
# Or
git cherry-pick 456def

# Return to the parent project directory and commit submodule updates
cd ..
git add path/to/your/submodule
git commit -m &amp;quot;Update submodule to include new changes&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-operational-instructions&#34;&gt;Key Operational Instructions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git reflog&lt;/strong&gt;: Displays the entire history of HEAD, including commits not associated with any branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git checkout -b&lt;/strong&gt;: Creates a new branch from any commit and saves your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git merge/cherry-pick&lt;/strong&gt;: Integrates saved commits into the target branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the reflog doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain records, you may need to try using &lt;code&gt;git fsck --lost-found&lt;/code&gt; to find orphaned commits, but this is a rare occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GitHub Pages Easter Egg: Deploying Multiple Pages</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/github-pages-easter-egg-deploy-multiple-sites/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 02:55:54 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/github-pages-easter-egg-deploy-multiple-sites/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, my biological clock has been a bit off, still tinkering with GitHub Pages deployments around 2 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to eat after work, and I just wanted to sleep when I finished, then came back around 8:30 PM, feeling drowsy, thinking I‚Äôd take a nap, and ended up falling asleep immediately. When I woke up, it was already past 2 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;facepalm&#34;&gt;Facepalm
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we said there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be much frontend development, but today it‚Äôs not frontend ‚Äì it‚Äôs the experience of UI/UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project&#34;&gt;Project
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please join our old friend, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&lt;/a&gt;.
That‚Äôs the original self-selected stock project ‚Äì we&amp;rsquo;re restructuring the overall project structure, and all subsequent AI programming content will be housed within this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploying-multiple-pages&#34;&gt;Deploying Multiple Pages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project is hosted domestically at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cnb.cool/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://cnb.cool/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&lt;/a&gt;. Due to well-known reasons, pages cannot be published within China, so we need to publish them on GitHub outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog is published on the external GitHub. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried this before, and also, the current project I‚Äôm working on isn‚Äôt a traditional blog site; it simply contains a lot of documentation layered with several static HTML design mockups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/github-pages-easter-egg-deploy-multiple-sites/20250528030230.png&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;150&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;361px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs right ‚Äì this page is where I discovered that deploying multiple pages using pages won&amp;rsquo;t affect the blog‚Äôs publication, but instead adds a new path under the blog‚Äôs domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/ai-coding-demo/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://ttf248.life/ai-coding-demo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was absolutely thrilled when I saw this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-study-group&#34;&gt;AI Study Group
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I created a new category and thought about using AI to learn many computer courses, such as algorithms and LeetCode practice problems.
Each learning record is published on the blog to form a knowledge base. A new category was created: AI Study Group.
Now it seems that different courses require creating separate projects, and all learning notes are written in the project&amp;rsquo;s Readme.md file.&lt;/p&gt;

Alternatively, a more literal translation could be: ‚ÄúOld ailments, beautiful eyes like blooming flowers.‚Äù However, the first option is generally preferred for its aesthetic quality.</title>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/old-ailment-stunning-flowers/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For many years, I‚Äôve focused on backend development, and recently started to explore &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; programming while dipping my toes into some frontend-related content. However, during this period of tinkering, I gradually realized I was falling back into an old habit ‚Äì being dazzled by shiny new things. I constantly try to use &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; to create a frontend interface, but in reality, these attempts haven‚Äôt provided much practical benefit for my current work and are actually wasting my energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-use-cases&#34;&gt;AI Use Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In small projects, AI tools can truly shine, particularly when writing independent functions with low coupling to the system and simple business logic. These tasks typically have clear inputs and outputs, and rely less on context ‚Äì making them well-suited for the current capabilities of AI-assisted programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when facing complex system architectures or deep business logic, AI‚Äôs limitations begin to emerge. It may generate code that appears reasonable but is actually detached from the project&amp;rsquo;s real needs, or even introduce potential issues that are difficult to debug. In these scenarios, AI is best suited as an assistive tool rather than a fully autonomous code generator. We need to conduct rigorous review and testing of the generated code to ensure it meets actual requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;errors-and-the-cost-of-learning&#34;&gt;Errors and the Cost of Learning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While attempting to generate frontend code using AI, I encountered numerous challenges. As frontend development isn&amp;rsquo;t a domain I‚Äôm familiar with, troubleshooting often proved time-consuming and frustrating. Even after adjusting prompts to have the AI rewrite the code, it was difficult to avoid the appearance of some low-level errors. This iterative process not only wasted time but also highlighted that my current focus should be on backend business logic rather than groping around in unfamiliar territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the project completed over the weekend, I‚Äôm even more convinced that focusing on backend development and user interaction logic, implementing functionality through a console, is the most efficient approach currently. Perhaps systematically learning frontend knowledge would be a better strategy when I have more time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;frontend-learning-plan&#34;&gt;Frontend Learning Plan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frontend technology stack is complex and diverse, so it‚Äôs unrealistic to quickly master it. I plan to first choose a framework, such as Vue.js or React.js, and deeply learn its core concepts and usage methods. Only after becoming familiar with the fundamentals will I attempt to use AI to generate frontend code, which can effectively avoid errors and wasted time caused by unfamiliarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the focus for this stage should be on backend development, steadily building my core skills. When the timing is right, I‚Äôll then explore the combination of frontend and AI ‚Äì potentially yielding greater rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Claude4 released, attempting to develop: Hugo tags, hyperlink translation assistant</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/claude-4-release-hugo-tags-hyperlink-translation-assistant/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 03:05:31 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/claude-4-release-hugo-tags-hyperlink-translation-assistant/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This site is developed using Hugo, but I‚Äôve always used Chinese titles, which results in less friendly generated article links. In simpler terms, when shared, they don&amp;rsquo;t look as good because the Chinese characters are escaped into formats like %E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD within the links. While you can solve this by setting a slug, it‚Äôs tedious to do manually every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I decided to try using Claude4 to develop a translation assistant that automatically converts Chinese titles to English slugs and adds hyperlinks within the articles. This would eliminate the need for manual setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude4 is amazing ‚Äì its contextual understanding has significantly improved, as has its efficiency in handling complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-address&#34;&gt;Project Address
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestic Project Address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cnb.cool/ttf248/hugo-content-suite&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://cnb.cool/ttf248/hugo-content-suite&lt;/a&gt;
International Project Address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/hugo-content-suite&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/ttf248/hugo-content-suite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-implementation&#34;&gt;Code Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s first discuss the implementation approach: We need to scan all articles, extract tag information and article titles, and then call on our local large model (such as gemma-3-12b-it) for translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In actual development, Claude4 showcased several significant advantages compared to previous generation large models. Due to the diverse functional requirements, Claude4 automatically designed an interactive menu, comprehensively considering various usage scenarios. For example, in tag processing, Claude4 not only supports tag statistics and analysis but also includes classification statistics and can even detect &lt;strong&gt;unlabeled articles&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, it provides &lt;strong&gt;preview&lt;/strong&gt; and tag page generation functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s integrating with local large models, adding translation caches, or performing large-scale code refactoring, Claude4 completes everything in one go, with almost no issues. Despite the relatively small project size, it includes many minor features. In previous development processes, large models often forgot earlier content, but Claude4 performed exceptionally well this time, &lt;strong&gt;virtually without any context forgetting issues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, intelligence has increased, and we plan to switch to Claude4 for more development work as our primary coding model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;translation-cache&#34;&gt;Translation Cache
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach, besides reducing the number of calls to large models, performs quite efficiently when running a 12b model locally ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt waste much time. However, if you need to call the large model every time, it will still be somewhat slow. Furthermore, to fix the connections within articles, if a full update operation is executed and the article title is very long, there&amp;rsquo;s occasionally a situation where the two translated results differ, causing the link to change ‚Äì which is quite awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;feature-optimization&#34;&gt;Feature Optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire project was handed over to &lt;code&gt;Claude4&lt;/code&gt; to analyze the space for optimization and obtain the following suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Externalize Configuration - Improve maintainability and flexibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structured Logging - Facilitate troubleshooting and monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance Monitoring - Understand system running status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Experience - Visual feedback such as progress bars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error Handling - A more robust exception handling mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Organization - Clearer module division&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code was reviewed, and there were no major issues, such as the configuration files. The original code&amp;rsquo;s configurations were converted to default settings, and if a corresponding configuration file wasn‚Äôt found during reading, a default one would be automatically generated to prevent user errors.
Requirement: When translating text into English, dynamically calculate the current translation efficiency, estimate the remaining time, and output relevant information to the console: Now it has obtained the character count of the article, the character count for each line being translated, the translation time, and fits the calculation of the translation time for every 100 characters. Simultaneously, it calculates the estimated remaining translation time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code was completed, but the effect wasn&amp;rsquo;t very satisfactory, so I asked AI to provide a new design solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide multiple efficiency calculation methods: Real-time efficiency, average efficiency, sliding window efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve display method: Progress bars, segmented statistics, dynamic refresh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more useful metrics: API call counts, success rates, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the code was completed, a new surprise was discovered ‚Äì translation efficiency statistics flooded in in real time, but without endless scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Multi-dimensional impacts of the family planning policy: deep transformations from social structure to economic and political changes.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-family-planning-policy-impacts/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 02:36:49 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-family-planning-policy-impacts/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;China‚Äôs population control policies, while limiting growth and curbing family-style development, have disrupted traditional social structures, suppressed the expansion of family-owned businesses and political dynasty power, presenting a unique case compared to South Korean conglomerates and Indian family monopolies. Now that birth restrictions are being relaxed, despite facing challenges such as low fertility rates, it‚Äôs crucial to be wary of new monopoly risks and seek balance through multiple avenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;one-the-disjunction-between-population-control-and-family-style-development&#34;&gt;One: The Disjunction Between Population Control and Family-Style Development
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family planning policy, which has been a fundamental national strategy in China for nearly forty years, has achieved significant direct results. Data shows that from 1978 to 2007, the natural growth rate of China‚Äôs population declined from 12‚Ä∞ to 5.2‚Ä∞, resulting in a reduction of over 40 million people, and the proportion of the Chinese population worldwide decreased from 22.2% to 20.1%. This sharp decline in population growth profoundly reshaped family structures within Chinese society. Taking family-owned enterprises as an example, after the implementation of the family planning policy, the number of children born by business owners declined significantly: before the policy, the proportion of those having three or more children reached 40.63%, and after the policy it plummeted to 18.46%, the proportion of single sons born increased from 6.25% to 32.31%. This structural change directly reduced the range of potential internal successors for family-owned enterprises, objectively suppressing their generational expansion capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Korea and India, the differences are significant. Although Korea did not implement strict family planning policies, its birth rate has remained low (0.7 in 2023), however, its chaebols have maintained control over the national economy through cross-shareholdings and tax avoidance mechanisms. The total revenue of the top five chaebols accounts for more than 50% of Korea‚Äôs GDP, with Samsung Group alone accounting for 20% of the country&amp;rsquo;s GDP. India, on the other hand, presents a different picture: 79% of economic output is contributed by family-owned enterprises, and six major conglomerates control key sectors such as telecommunications and steel, with twenty top companies earning 80% of national corporate profits. The core of this difference lies in the fact that China‚Äôs family planning policy, through limiting family size, has weakened the human resources base for family-owned enterprise expansion from the source, while Korea and India have been able to sustain their influence in economic sectors due to different policy environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;two-monopoly-restraint-and-social-structural-transformation&#34;&gt;Two. Monopoly Restraint and Social Structural Transformation
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the economic sector is particularly evident in its suppression of monopoly phenomena. Due to the reduced number of children within Chinese family businesses, the formation of Han-Indian style conglomerates like those led by chaebols was difficult. Taking Korea as an example, chaebols maintained control through ‚Äúcircular investment,‚Äù with the Samsung family holding only 2% of the group‚Äôs shares but controlling the entire operation through complex equity structures. In China, after the family planning policy, family businesses generally faced the dilemma of ‚Äúpassing down from father to son,‚Äù often necessitating the introduction of professional managers or implementing equity diversification reforms. According to aÊπÉÊñ∞Èóª (Papare News) study, the proportion of female successors in family businesses after family planning increased from 13.85% to 34.21%, and the education level of these successors significantly improved, with the percentage of college graduates rising from 43.75% to 98.46%. While this transformation has not completely eliminated family control, it has significantly reduced the possibility of a single family monopolizing the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the social structural level, the family planning policy accelerated the disintegration of traditional family core models. The average household size in China decreased from 4.41 people/household in 1982 to 2.62 people/household in 2020, weakening the family‚Äôs functions in areas such as economics, education, and social support. In contrast, India maintains a family size of around 4 people, with the caste system deeply intertwined with family power, leading to low social mobility. China&amp;rsquo;s transformation of household structure created space for individualism, with the number of single adult citizens reaching 240 million in 2023, and a trend of ‚Äúone-person economy‚Äù emerging in the consumer market ‚Äì further diminishing the influence of family economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;three-decentralization-of-power-in-the-political-sphere&#34;&gt;Three. Decentralization of Power in the Political Sphere
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the political landscape has been profound. Traditionally, family power structures had infiltrated grassroots politics through bloodlines and kinship relationships. For example, the 161 political families in Henan‚Äôs Xinye County virtually controlled all government departments, with 20% of cadres at deputy-level or above belonging to ‚Äúofficer‚Äôs children.‚Äù However, after the implementation of the family planning policy, shrinking family sizes limited the expansion of family networks. Research from Peking University showed that the number of offspring of officials decreased after family planning, and the complexity of family political networks significantly declined. Furthermore, the policy-driven promotion of education (the average years of schooling increased from 5.2 in 1982 to 10.9 in 2023) facilitated social mobility, weakening the monopoly of family power over political resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison with South Korea and India, the deep entanglement between Korean conglomerates and politics (such as Samsung Group executives engaging in bribery with government officials) and the hereditary family politics under the Indian caste system highlighted the uniqueness of China‚Äôs policy. China objectively reduced the possibility of power succession through the family planning policy. Despite the presence of family phenomena in county-level politics, the overall trend is towards the decentralization of the power structure. During the 2025 National People&amp;rsquo;s Congress meeting, a CPPCC member proposed renaming ‚ÄúThe Law on Population and Family Planning‚Äù to ‚ÄúThe Law on Population and Reproduction,‚Äù fully opening up childbirth ‚Äì a move that may further influence the future evolution of the political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;four-challenges-and-opportunities-following-policy-adjustments&#34;&gt;Four, Challenges and Opportunities Following Policy Adjustments
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the 2016 comprehensive two-child policy and the 2021 three-child policy marked a significant shift in China‚Äôs birth policies. However, the effects were limited: In 2022, the birth rate was only 1.18, far below the replacement level (2.1). The relaxation of birth restrictions had a dual impact on family-owned enterprises: On one hand, some entrepreneurs may strengthen their family succession capabilities through multiple births, such as Zong Qinghui, the daughter of Zhong Quehui of Wahaha Group in Zhejiang, who took over as the sole heir; on the other hand, high childcare costs (the average cost of raising a child to 18 years old in first-tier cities reaches 10 million yuan) and declining fertility intentions among professional women limited the expansion of family size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the economic sphere, relaxing birth restrictions may give rise to new monopoly forms. The three-child policy has accelerated the concentration of the maternal and childcare industry, with the market size of infant and toddler care expected to reach 1621.3 billion yuan in 2025. Leading companies have consolidated smaller manufacturers through mergers and acquisitions, resulting in a CR5 market concentration exceeding 55%. This increase in concentration may bring efficiency, but it also needs to be wary of new monopoly risks. The government must seek a balance between encouraging births and preventing market concentration, such as strengthening regulation through antitrust laws while providing childcare subsidies (such as Hangzhou‚Äôs three-child families receiving a monthly milk powder subsidy of 3000 yuan) to reduce family burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the political sphere, relaxing birth restrictions may have subtle impacts on family power structures. Although it is unlikely to restore traditional family political networks in the short term, from a long-term perspective, multi-child families may form new influence in grassroots politics. Therefore, improving personnel selection mechanisms and strengthening supervision (such as establishing a cadre relative appointment avoidance system) are still crucial for preventing hereditary power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;five-international-mirroring-and-future-outlook&#34;&gt;Five. International Mirroring and Future Outlook
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiences of South Korea and India demonstrate that the ebb and flow of family power is closely linked to policy orientations. South Korea achieved economic takeoff by supporting conglomerates, but at the cost of social inequality; India‚Äôs failure to implement effective policies to curb family monopolies has exacerbated wealth disparity. China&amp;rsquo;s population control policy effectively suppressed the expansion of family powers while simultaneously creating problems such as an aging population and labor shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, China needs to find a new balance between population policy and socio-economic development. On one hand, it should increase birth rates through fertility support policies (such as extending maternity leave and building accessible childcare institutions); on the other hand, it must strengthen antitrust enforcement to prevent family businesses from forming new monopolies through capital operations. In the political sphere, further progress is needed in grassroots democracy construction, strengthening oversight mechanisms, and ensuring transparency in governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, population control policies were a key driver of social change in China, with impacts far exceeding the realm of population. They reshaped family structures, economic models, and the political landscape, providing a path for China to avoid falling into the trap of family monopolies seen in Korea and India. As policies are adjusted, balancing efficiency and equity, freedom and order within the new demographic context will be a long-term challenge facing China.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AI overuse can lead to some lingering effects.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-overuse-side-effects/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 19:39:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-overuse-side-effects/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since we‚Äôve established ‚ÄúAI Inspiration Collision Forum,‚Äù there‚Äôs been a lot of random content being created, with people experimenting with AI to record and publish things, but thoughtful reflection is becoming increasingly scarce. Moving forward, it would be beneficial to slightly control the output of this section and consolidate it into a monthly magazine format ‚Äì releasing one article per month would suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feels like a sort of aftereffect or side effect; efficiency has increased, but the depth and breadth of thought have declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;efficiency-boost-undeniable&#34;&gt;Efficiency Boost: Undeniable
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‚ÄúSeven-Second Fish Sightseeing‚Äù column used to be poorly maintained, with only a few hot events covered. Due to laziness, I hadn‚Äôt searched the internet for relevant materials or compiled records. Now that various AI tools are available, all it takes is outlining the key points, and AI can automatically search for related events, generate articles as needed, simply format them, and publish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like a blessing for lazy people ‚Äì efficiency has increased significantly, almost to the point of doubling efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond writing articles, efficiency gains are real when coding. Previously, writing code often required detailed reading of API interface documentation. Now, I can skip this entirely. This is incredibly valuable because familiarizing oneself with APIs is ‚Äúphysical labor,‚Äù not ‚Äúmental labor.‚Äù AI handles this part perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spam-content&#34;&gt;Spam Content
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many articles have poor quality content, not to say that there‚Äôs nothing there; it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t read well, lacking a sense of reality and what people actually experience. It‚Äôs a style I didn‚Äôt enjoy before ‚Äì like chewing wax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From another perspective, AI-generated content really does feel like products of aÊµÅÊ∞¥Á∫ø (li√∫ shu«ê li√†n - assembly line) production, lacking soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Era Internet Spam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forgetting&#34;&gt;Forgetting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of document is entirely AI-generated, and the reader‚Äôs context is unclear. However, over time, my own impressions will become blurred, or even forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar issues occur when writing code ‚Äì without reviewing commit records, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember how I originally thought about it, or why I wrote it that way. This is particularly evident with code generated through repeated communication with AI, where the final code differs significantly from the initial ideas, sometimes drastically so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;search&#34;&gt;Search
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the number of times I‚Äôve opened Google and Baidu has noticeably decreased. Many questions are now being answered by AI for searching and interaction, and the results are much better than traditional search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s mourn the &lt;code&gt;bing ai&lt;/code&gt;, which may no longer be active, a pioneering AI tool from a major company that could connect to the internet and search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm using Google less, and the number of times I visit &lt;code&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/code&gt; has decreased as well. Many questions are now simply asked of AI ‚Äì this website is gradually being phased out by the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My maintained blog, originally with very little traffic, is now even less expected of; it‚Äôs primarily a place for self-reflection and recording.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trade war abruptly called a pause</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 19:07:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of trade war tariffs in 2025 presented a ‚Äúescalation ‚Äì counter-repressive measures ‚Äì negotiations‚Äù cycle, with the US-China rivalry shifting from tariff confrontation to competition over rules. Despite short-term easing that alleviated market pressure, long-term uncertainty persists, and it‚Äôs crucial to monitor WTO rulings, supply chain adjustments, and geopolitical shifts&amp;rsquo; ongoing impact on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don‚Äôt earn money beyond their own perception; the stock market crash triggered by the launch of the trade war this year has largely recovered, but countless small investors have been buried along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2025 Trade War Tariff Timeline Overview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a timeline of the trade war tariff events, combining key events involving the US and China, and other countries, to present the dynamic evolution of tariff policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;one-april-2025--comprehensive-tariff-upgrade-and-countermeasures&#34;&gt;One: April 2025 ‚Äì Comprehensive Tariff Upgrade and Countermeasures
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Tariffs on China&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2nd:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration signed Executive Order No. 14257, announcing the imposition of a 34% ‚Äúretaliatory tariff‚Äù on goods shipped from China to the U.S., covering products originating from Hong Kong and Macau.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 8th:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States further increased the ‚Äúretaliatory tariff‚Äù rate on Chinese goods from 34% to 84%, signing Executive Orders No. 14259 and 14266 to impose tariffs on additional products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 10th:&lt;/strong&gt; The White House amended the executive order, increasing the total tariff amount on Chinese goods to 145% and raising the rate on small packages (such as goods priced below $800 from 90% to 120%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China‚Äôs Countermeasures&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 4th:&lt;/strong&gt; China announced a 34% tariff on all goods originating in the United States, covering sectors such as agricultural products, automobiles, and energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 10th:&lt;/strong&gt; China raised the retaliatory tariff rate from 34% to 84%, synchronizing with the U.S. side‚Äôs escalation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 12th:&lt;/strong&gt; China cancelled the 91% tariffs imposed on US goods (corresponding to some of the tariffs cancelled by the US side) and suspended the implementation of the 24% tariff for 90 days, retaining a 10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Countries‚Äô Tariff Game&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S.-Canada Trade War:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum products, and Canada retaliated by imposing taxes on US goods worth $2.98 billion CAD, and filed a WTO dispute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EU and Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; The EU imposed maximum 25% tariffs on U.S. goods, while Japan expressed concern about auto tariffs on the United States, calling the trade war ‚Äúharming both sides.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-may-2025-geneva-talks-and-tariff-de-escalation&#34;&gt;II. May 2025: Geneva Talks and Tariff De-escalation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US-China High-Level Trade Talks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 10-11&lt;/strong&gt;: The US and China held a 16-hour meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, reaching the ‚ÄúJoint Statement on the US-China Economic Talks.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 12&lt;/strong&gt;: Both sides announced a suspension of some tariffs:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United States suspended its 24% tariff on Chinese goods (90 days), retaining 10%, and rescinded the additional tariffs imposed on April 8th and 9th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China simultaneously suspended its 24% retaliatory tariffs, retaining 10%, and lifted non-tariff measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishment of a Consultation Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;: Both sides agreed to hold regular trade consultations in China, the United States, or a third country, focusing on tariff reduction and rulemaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Impact &amp;amp; Policy Adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Domestic Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;: High tariffs led to the closure of small and medium-sized enterprises (such as Amazon sellers forced to close due to tariff surges) and fueled inflationary expectations (core PCE is expected to rise to 3.3%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China Rare Earth Countermeasures&lt;/strong&gt;: China strengthened controls on rare earth exports, cracked down on smuggling, impacting US defense and new energy industries, which were granted exemptions on tariffs for key minerals such as rare earths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-other-key-events-and-long-term-impacts&#34;&gt;III. Other Key Events and Long-Term Impacts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WTO and Multilateral Reactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canada and China both lodged WTO disputes against the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and ‚Äúretaliatory tariffs,‚Äù alleging violations of non-discrimination principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTO Director-General Azevedo warned that U.S. tariffs could cause a 1% contraction in global trade volumes by 2025, exacerbating difficulties for developing countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exemption Lists and Industry Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Excluded Goods:&lt;/strong&gt; A 37-page list covering strategic materials such as rare earths, graphite, and medical CT balls exposed supply chain vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto Tariffs:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imported automobiles, leading to an estimated 2% decline in global auto production and a 9% reduction in North American output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political and Strategic Maneuvering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration attempted to reshape the international trade order through ‚Äúretaliatory tariffs,‚Äù but was criticized as unilateral bullying, triggering backlash from allies (such as the EU and Japan).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China responded to protectionism with efforts to expand market access (such as the Cross-Border e-Commerce Expo and zero-tariff commitments), attracting cooperation from developing countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;td&gt;April 12th&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The United States waived some goods (such as technology products), China lifted 91% of the counter-rebalancing tariffs.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Term Relief and Long-Term Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; The suspension of U.S.-China tariffs sent positive signals, but structural issues (such as high technology and energy) remain, with midterm elections or policy continuity impacting the medium term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Supply Chain Restructuring:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies are accelerating adjustments to their supply chains, with Mexico and Southeast Asia benefiting from ‚Äúnearshoring,‚Äù but rising costs could dampen recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilateral Mechanism Dilemmas:&lt;/strong&gt; The WTO dispute resolution mechanism is limited, regional trade agreements (such as the U.S.-UK agreement) are emerging as alternative options, but this exacerbates fragmentation.&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;2020-2025 Years: The recruitment of teachers in Jiangxi Province shows a significant reduction trend: the number of specially appointed teachers decreased sharply from 6,617 to 32 (a decrease of 99.5%), and the number of national cadre teachers decreased from 11,324 to 2,146 (a decrease of 81.1%). The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, mathematics, and English) remained stable but declined in total volume; while the proportions of music, art, and physical education increased, the absolute number was limited (e.g., in 2025, they only recruited 2 people each). Policy-wise, &amp;ldquo;one withdrawal, one replacement&amp;rdquo; personnel adjustments have tightened, with teacher resources leaning towards vocational training and remote areas, traditional primary and secondary school positions have significantly reduced, and some subjects are planning for zero recruitment in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruitment numbers of specially appointed teachers in Jiangxi Province over the past five years have been collected, with data sorted by subject and compiled into a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äî ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on recruitment announcements and publicly available data released by the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and other official agencies, the following summarizes the recruitment situation for contracted teachers and civil servant teachers from 2020-2025. Please note that &lt;strong&gt;2025 data represents planned recruitment numbers&lt;/strong&gt;, and some years‚Äô subject breakdowns are not fully disclosed; subjects marked as ‚Äúunspecified‚Äù in the table represent total figures or missing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-data-explanation&#34;&gt;III. Data Explanation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Source&lt;/strong&gt;: Recruitment announcements and official statistics from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education and the Department of Human Resources and Social Security over the past years (actual recruitment numbers for 2020-2024, planned numbers for 2025).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject Categories&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special Teachers focus on subjects at rural primary and secondary education stages; in 2025, only a small number of core positions will be retained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Personnel Teachers cover all academic levels, with a more comprehensive subject setting including preschool education and special education (due to data not being segmented, these were not listed separately).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trend Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharp Decline in Total Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;: The recruitment quota for Special Teachers decreased by 99.5% compared to 2020 in 2025, and the recruitment quota for National Personnel Teachers decreased by 81.1%, reflecting demographic changes and adjustments in educational resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject Hotness&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, Mathematics, English) remained stable but declined year on year in terms of recruitment numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjects such as Music, Art, and Physical Education, as well as Information Technology, saw an increase in their proportions, but the absolute number was limited (e.g., in 2025, Music and Art each recruited only 2 people).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some subjects (such as English) experienced freezes due to a decrease in student numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Background&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightening of Personnel Quotas&lt;/strong&gt;: The ‚ÄúOne Out, One In‚Äù policy is being implemented, strictly controlling the addition of new quotas; in 2024, the proportion of non-quota positions reached 68.6%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Adjustment&lt;/strong&gt;: Teacher resources are leaning towards vocational education and remote areas, with significant reductions in recruitment to traditional primary and secondary schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Merge the Pull Request into the Repository of the Fork</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/merge-pullrequest-to-forked-repo/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 18:44:03 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/merge-pullrequest-to-forked-repo/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;github-readme-stats&lt;/code&gt; is a GitHub profile statistics generator that allows users to display various statistics and charts within their GitHub profiles. It offers multiple customization options to tailor it to user needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I manage my repository habits by grouping them by project; GitHub doesn&amp;rsquo;t support repository grouping, so I have to achieve this by splitting repositories across different organizations. The latest branch of &lt;code&gt;github-readme-stats&lt;/code&gt; cannot support statistics for repositories spanning different organizations; I forked a branch and merged the corresponding code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;merging-a-pull-request-into-your-forked-repository&#34;&gt;Merging a Pull Request into Your Forked Repository
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To merge a &lt;strong&gt;Pull Request (PR)&lt;/strong&gt; into your &lt;strong&gt;forked repository&lt;/strong&gt;, there are several ways to do this, depending on whether you want to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge the PR from the &lt;strong&gt;upstream repository&lt;/strong&gt; into your fork, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge a PR from another person‚Äôs fork into your fork, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge a PR that was opened on your fork (e.g., someone forked and created a PR for you)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll first give you a common scenario: &lt;strong&gt;You have forked a repository and want to merge a PR from the upstream into your fork&lt;/strong&gt;.  Here‚Äôs the workflow below üëá&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-method-one-command-line-most-universal&#34;&gt;‚úÖ Method One: Command Line (Most Universal)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-1-clone-your-own-fork&#34;&gt;Step 1: Clone your own fork
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-2-add-upstream-original-repository-address&#34;&gt;Step 2: Add Upstream (Original Repository Address)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-author-username/repository-name.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-3-fetch-the-upstream-pr-branch&#34;&gt;Step 3: Fetch the Upstream PR Branch
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the PR number you want to merge, for example PR #123.
You can then checkout the code for that PR like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git fetch upstream pull/123/head:pr-123
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-4-switch-and-merge-branches&#34;&gt;Step 4: Switch and Merge Branches
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git checkout main    # Or your own target branch
git merge pr-123
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything goes well, you can push to your forked GitHub repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git push origin main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-method-two-github-web-interface-simple-but-limited&#34;&gt;‚úÖ Method Two: GitHub Web Interface (Simple but Limited)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see a PR on GitHub‚Äôs web interface that is against the upstream repository, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the PR page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù or ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;Files changed&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù in the top-right corner to see which branch this PR is based on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On your fork page, create a new branch and then manually cherry-pick the PR‚Äôs commit (requires Git knowledge).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or, click ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;Open in GitHub Desktop&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù and use the GUI tool to merge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-if-someone-has-created-a-fork-and-submitted-a-pr-to-it-simply-navigate-to-the-pr-page-click-the-merge-pull-request-button-and-youre-done&#34;&gt;üöÄ If someone has created a fork and submitted a PR to it, simply navigate to the PR page, click the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Merge pull request&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; button, and you‚Äôre done.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like me to walk you through it step-by-step based on your specific scenario (e.g., PR link, whether you&amp;rsquo;re using a web interface or the command line)? Or, please provide the link and I can analyze the simplest approach for you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Commit messages in Git‚Äôs history</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-modify-commit-message/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 18:38:31 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-modify-commit-message/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Script for batch modifying Git history commit author information, rewriting Git history records using &lt;code&gt;git filter-branch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You provided the script to modify the author information in the Git repository history in bulk. The overall approach is correct, but using an array (e.g., &lt;code&gt;OLD_EMAILS=(&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;) within the &lt;code&gt;git filter-branch&lt;/code&gt;‚Äôs &lt;code&gt;--env-filter&lt;/code&gt; might cause compatibility issues because some shell environments (such as &lt;code&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;) do not support array syntax.
To improve compatibility, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to replace the array with space-separated strings and use a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop to iterate through each old email address. Here is an example of the modified script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;#!/bin/sh

git filter-branch --env-filter &#39;
OLD_EMAILS=&amp;quot;TianlongXiang51@gmail.com nick@qq.com tianlongxiang51@gmail.com&amp;quot;
CORRECT_NAME=&amp;quot;tianlong.xiang&amp;quot;
CORRECT_EMAIL=&amp;quot;tianlong.xiang@foxmail.com&amp;quot;

for OLD_EMAIL in $OLD_EMAILS
do
    if [ &amp;quot;$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;$OLD_EMAIL&amp;quot; ]
    then
        export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_NAME&amp;quot;
        export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_EMAIL&amp;quot;
    fi
    if [ &amp;quot;$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;$OLD_EMAIL&amp;quot; ]
    then
        export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_NAME&amp;quot;
        export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_EMAIL&amp;quot;
    fi
done
&#39; --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is recommended to back up your repository before executing this script to prevent any unexpected issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This operation rewrites Git history, modifying the author information of commits, which may cause changes in commit hash values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have already pushed the changes to a remote repository, you need to use a forced push:
Please use forced pushes cautiously, especially in collaborative projects, to avoid affecting others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count all unique authors&amp;rsquo; email addresses in the repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git log --format=&#39;%an &amp;lt;%ae&amp;gt;&#39; | sort -u
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

The exposure of Dong Xi Ying‚Äôs case in 2025 revealed her reliance on family background (medical/scientific research lineage) to gain entry into the program, raising concerns about the ambiguity of her qualifications, allegations of plagiarism in her dissertation, and exposing contradictions between its elite recruitment model and fairness, as well as ongoing debates regarding shortened study durations and clinical internship training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompts&#34;&gt;Prompts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog: Harmony 4+4 Origin and Development, Core: A Corner of Tian Gong, Seen by Mortals, Dong Xiaojie&amp;rsquo;s Family Background, Normal Medical Doctor Cannot Graduate in Eight Years, Dong Xiaojie‚Äôs Family Background &amp;amp; Educational Background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harmony-44-deconstructing-medical-educations-tiangong-heavenly-palace&#34;&gt;Harmony 4+4: Deconstructing Medical Education‚Äôs ‚ÄúTiangong‚Äù (Heavenly Palace)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‚Äú4+4‚Äù project at the Beijing Union Medical College, launched in 2018, has been viewed as China‚Äôs ‚ÄúTiangong‚Äù (Heavenly Palace) in medical education. This project, designed to mimic the American medical education system, adopted the philosophy of ‚Äúnurturing multidisciplinary individuals, those who love medicine, and talents from across the nation.‚Äù It aimed to create a rift within traditional Chinese medical education by focusing on: &lt;strong&gt;replacing the traditional 5+3+3 (five-year bachelor‚Äôs degree + three-year master‚Äôs degree + three-year doctoral degree) model with four years of non-medical undergraduate education plus four years of medical doctorate training,&lt;/strong&gt; to cultivate cross-disciplinary leadership talent in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model&amp;rsquo;s ‚ÄúTiangong‚Äù attribute is reflected across three dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elite Recruitment:&lt;/strong&gt; Early on, applicants were required to come from universities ranked within the top 50 by QS/Times/US News or among the top 10 (e.g., Barnard College) in US News‚Äôs liberal arts and sciences rankings. Although later relaxed to the top 100, a GPA of 3.6 or higher, or ranking within the top 30 of their class, was still required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internationalized Training Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; The project utilized American-style organ-system integrated courses and PBL (Problem-Based Learning) teaching methods. Students were expected to complete core courses such as anatomy and pathology within four years and participate in clinical internships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controversial Quality Output:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite a slightly lower passing rate on the physician licensing exam (95.2%) compared to the traditional eight-year model (98.5%), graduates predominantly entered Union Medical College hospitals, with their career development showing no significant difference from traditional pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dong-xiyi-incident-peering-through-the-heavenly-palace-crack--a-glimpse-of-privilege&#34;&gt;Dong Xiyi Incident: Peering Through the &amp;ldquo;Heavenly Palace&amp;rdquo; Crack ‚Äì A Glimpse of Privilege
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, the extramarital affair involving Xiao Fei, a thoracic surgeon at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, triggered an investigation into the ‚Äúmysterious veil‚Äù surrounding the Covariance 4+4 project. The background and credentials of Dong Xiyi, the central figure in the scandal, sparked three key questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambiguity Regarding Educational Background:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Over Undergraduate Institution:&lt;/strong&gt; Dong Xiyi claimed to have graduated from Columbia University, but her actual enrollment was at Barnard College (ranked 14th among top liberal arts colleges according to US News in 2025). Despite the college meeting Covariance‚Äôs requirement of ‚Äútop 20 liberal arts schools,‚Äù her diploma simultaneously listed both &amp;ldquo;Barnard College&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Columbia University,&amp;rdquo; which could easily be misinterpreted as a Columbia University graduate within the domestic recruitment market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Over Professional Field:&lt;/strong&gt; An economics undergraduate degree combined with a clinical medicine doctorate is considered to align with the 4+4 project‚Äôs positioning of ‚Äúmulti-disciplinary background,‚Äù but it has been questioned for lacking foundational pre-medical courses. Her doctoral dissertation, &amp;ldquo;Research on Multi-modal Image Fusion Technology in Medical Imaging Analysis,&amp;rdquo; was alleged to closely resemble a patent developed by North Korea Tech, raising concerns about academic misconduct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Characteristics of Family Background:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monopoly of Academic Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Her father served as Secretary of the China Metallurgical Construction Research Institute, and her mother was Deputy Director of the North Korea Tech Engineering Technology Institute. Her grandfather was a professor in Covariance‚Äôs imaging field, and her paternal grandparents were foreign professors in the materials field. This ‚Äúmedical + research + university‚Äù composite family background provided her with implicit resources such as recommendation letters (requiring recommendations from two biomedical associate professors) and research collaborations (such as North Korea Tech patents).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jump in Career Path:&lt;/strong&gt; She switched from thoracic surgery during internship to urology, and her research direction spanned bone and joint, digestive system, and imaging fields, raising questions about ‚Äúpaved the way for resources.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnified Dispute Over Length of Study:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationality of Time Compression:&lt;/strong&gt; Traditional medical doctorates require 11 years (5+3+3), while the 4+4 project compressed this time to 8 years. Although Covariance emphasized ‚Äúcourse integration‚Äù and ‚Äúearly clinical practice,‚Äù some doctors pointed out that her clinical internship period (12 months) was less than the traditional eight-year program (18 months), potentially hindering skill accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Over Reduced Internship:&lt;/strong&gt; Some internship bases allowed 4+4 graduates to reduce their internship by one year, raising concerns about disrupting industry fairness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-medical-education-quagmire-behind-the-controversy&#34;&gt;The Medical Education Quagmire Behind the Controversy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dong Xiying incident reflects deep contradictions within Chinese medical education:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict Between Elitism and Equity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ‚Äúapplication-assessment‚Äù model of the 4+4 program is essentially a transplant of the American medical school model, but China lacks standardized exams like MCAT, relying instead on subjective evaluations such as letters of recommendation and research experience, which are susceptible to influence from family background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data shows that in the 2023 graduating class of 4+4 students, 30% came from Qingbei Fuzhou (Jilin, Beijing, Zhejiang), and 25% from overseas top universities; the impact of family background on applications is significant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reality of Curriculum Reform:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cost of Time Compression:&lt;/strong&gt; 4+4 students produce significantly fewer research outputs (such as the number of papers) than traditional eight-year programs, and are accused of ‚Äúprioritizing clinical work over research.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Division in Industry Recognition:&lt;/strong&gt; Three-class hospitals prioritize the reputation of Covance (commonly known as &amp;ldquo;Kohe&amp;rdquo;), whileÂü∫Â±ÇÂåªÈô¢ (jƒ´ch√©ng yƒ´yu√†n - primary care hospitals) maintain a cautious attitude towards the clinical abilities of 4+4 graduates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Misguided Pursuit of International Alignment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The American 4+4 model requires passing the MCAT exam and completing 3-7 years of residency, while China‚Äôs 4+4 program simplifies both admission and residency stages, leading to ‚Äúform resembling substance but lacking true substance.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data from the Ministry of Education shows that in 2024, the national enrollment of medical doctors under the 4+4 program was less than 5%, and its large-scale promotion still faces resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-reconstructing-the-tiangong-order-for-medical-education&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Reconstructing the &amp;ldquo;Tiangong&amp;rdquo; Order for Medical Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding the Keho 4+4 project fundamentally represents a collision between elite education and public expectations. When a corner of ‚ÄúTiangong‚Äù (the Palace of Heaven) was glimpsed by mortals, it exposed not just isolated instances of flaws, but deeper contradictions within the entire medical education system. Future reforms must focus on three levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement Transparent Selection Mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; Introduce standardized exams (such as a Chinese version of MCAT) to reduce the influence of subjective factors like letters of recommendation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extend Clinical Training Cycles:&lt;/strong&gt; Restore clinical training cycles for 4+4 graduates to 3 years, ensuring that clinical competence is achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen Process Oversight:&lt;/strong&gt; Establish an academic integrity review mechanism and conduct rigorous originality verification for interdisciplinary research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical education‚Äôs ‚ÄúTiangong‚Äù should not be the privilege of a few; it should truly be a cradle for nurturing medical elites. Only when fairness in selection mechanisms, rigor in the training process, and norms in professional development are comprehensively guaranteed will this ‚ÄúTiangong experiment‚Äù in medical education truly take root and flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tariff Storm, Stock Market Crash</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/tariff-storm-stock-market-crash/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 03:49:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/tariff-storm-stock-market-crash/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the global stock markets have experienced severe fluctuations, primarily due to President Donald Trump‚Äôs announcement of a new round of comprehensive tariffs, which has triggered market concerns about a global trade war and an economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariff Policy Fuels Market Panic&lt;/strong&gt;
President Trump announced last week the imposition of high tariffs on all imported goods, with up to 50% tariffs added on imports from China, aimed at correcting what he calls the unfair global trading system. This move led to panic selling in global markets, as investors worried that escalating trade tensions would suppress global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Stock Markets Plunge Sharply&lt;/strong&gt;
In the United States, major stock indices suffered heavy losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,200 points, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell by 4%, and the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index fell by 3.8%, entering bear market territory. Asian and European markets were also not spared, with Japan‚Äôs Nikkei Index falling nearly 8% and European stocks down 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investors Seek Safe-Haven Assets&lt;/strong&gt;
Faced with market turmoil, investors flocked to safe-haven assets such as bonds and the Japanese yen. However, the volatility index (VIX) soared to above 60, indicating heightened market panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economists Warn of Stagnation Risk&lt;/strong&gt;
Economists warned that tariff policies could lead the U.S. economy into ‚Äústagflation‚Äù ‚Äì a situation characterized by stagnant economic growth, rising inflation, and high unemployment rates. Morgan Stanley has increased the probability of a U.S. economic recession in 2025 to 60%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reactions of Governments and Companies&lt;/strong&gt;
Governments around the world have stated that they will take retaliatory measures. For example, the European Union‚Äôs trade representative said that tariffs would be imposed on American goods starting April 15th. Businesses also expressed concerns, with Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs raising the probability of a U.S. economic recession to 45%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
Currently, global markets are facing unprecedented challenges, and investors need to closely monitor trade policy developments and market changes, and prepare for risk management and asset allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Feeling bored and wanting to design a Chinese ink wash style theme.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/designing-a-chinese-ink-style-theme/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 03:42:47 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/designing-a-chinese-ink-style-theme/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve grown tired of staring at colorful, cluttered homepages and suddenly want to embrace a minimalist style, designing a Chinese ink wash theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the stylesheet is heavily customized ‚Äì specific styles are configured to override the default theme styles for different elements. Without refactoring, attempting to generate a new theme directly with AI yielded inconsistent results; it was difficult to describe‚Äîthe output was very unstable.  Adding to this, I encountered a queue for trae claude large model and switched to vscode agent mode, which resulted in even worse outcomes ‚Äì the generated changes lacked any design sense. Ultimately, it comes down to my own lack of understanding of frontend development, preventing me from effectively breaking down tasks and delegating them to AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Wide Base Exponential Fixed Investment (also known as ‚ÄúBuy and Hold‚Äù): Brokerage ETF, Heng Seng Tech Index</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/broad-based-index-etf-investing/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 21:58:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/broad-based-index-etf-investing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always wanted to do things, like buying a suitable blue-chip stock and just letting it sit, waiting for it to drop so I could see the situation and not add more if it rose, but ultimately never managed to execute that. It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to find an appropriate broad market index fund ‚Äì buy an ETF instead. My current plan is: a brokerage ETF and the Hong Kong Technology Index ETF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of trading strategy described above has a professional name: bottom-up buying during a downtrend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As for what‚Äôs next, my plan is to completely practice this by choosing a broad market index fund that can outperform the returns of regular savings accounts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brokerage-etfs&#34;&gt;Brokerage ETFs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brokerage ETF is an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) whose primary investment target is Chinese securities companies. It primarily invests in the listed stocks of Chinese securities companies in the stock market. Brokerage ETFs typically track a specific brokerage company index, such as the China Securities Brokerage Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I previously bought one, but it was at a peak and ultimately resulted in losses, so I liquidated my position. In the Chinese market, whenever there‚Äôs a bull run, brokerage companies are bound to rise ‚Äì and by how much, depends on investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-tech-index&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Tech Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index is an equity index launched by the Hong Kong Exchange, designed to reflect the overall performance of the technology industry in Hong Kong markets. The index includes major technology companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, covering areas such as internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 20, 2025, the top ten constituents of the Hang Seng Tech Index (code: 800700) and their weightings are listed below (data sourced from multiple authoritative sources):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi Group-W&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://01810.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;01810.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 8.82%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tencent Holdings&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://00700.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;00700.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 8.14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba-W&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09988.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09988.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 7.72%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JD Group-SW&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09618.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09618.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 7.60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan-W&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://03690.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;03690.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 7.35%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kuaishou-W&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://01024.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;01024.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 6.10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Li Auto-W&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://02015.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;02015.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 6.09%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation)&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://00981.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;00981.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 5.70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NetEase-S&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09999.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09999.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 4.59%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ctrip Group-S&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09961.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09961.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 4.48%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Weighting:&lt;/strong&gt; Approximately 66.6% (Some sources show the top ten weighting between 68%-69%, due to differences in statistical timing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-notes&#34;&gt;Key Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight Cap Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; The Hang Seng Tech Index sets an 8% weight limit for individual stocks. For example, before the adjustment on March 2025, SMIC‚Äôs weighting exceeded 8%, but was subsequently passively reduced to comply with the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constituent Stock Adjustments:&lt;/strong&gt; On May 16, 2025, the Hang Seng Index Company announced that BYD ( &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://01211.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;01211.HK&lt;/a&gt; ) will be included in the index and that Ruyi Group (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://00772.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;00772.HK&lt;/a&gt;) will be excluded. The adjustment will take effect on June 6th. Therefore, the current (May 20th) constituent stocks are based on the pre-adjustment list, and BYD has not yet been included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry Distribution:&lt;/strong&gt; Among the top ten constituent stocks, internet technology companies (such as Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan) dominate, with new energy vehicles (Xiaomi, Ideal) and semiconductors (SMIC) having significant weights, reflecting the index‚Äôs coverage of technology and the new economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Timeliness:&lt;/strong&gt; Differences in data from different sources are mainly due to differences in statistical timing points. For example, the data shown in March 2025 shows that the top ten combined accounted for approximately 69.4%, while the data on May 14th was 68.82%, reflecting the dynamic impact of market fluctuations on weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;short-put-cover&#34;&gt;Short Put Cover
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúShort Put Cover‚Äù is an investment strategy that refers to a trader‚Äôs proactive buying of stocks in a declining price trend, anticipating the stock price approaching its bottom and aiming to reduce their average cost per share. This approach falls under ‚Äúshort-side trading,‚Äù which involves taking opposing positions before the market has clearly established a bottom. Specifically, investors often employ a ‚Äúpyramiding‚Äù or ‚Äútiered accumulation‚Äù strategy, gradually increasing their purchase volume as the stock price declines, thereby reducing their average cost basis. For example, initially buying a certain number of shares, if the price continues to fall, the investor increases the purchase volume at a lower price, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce Cost Basis:&lt;/strong&gt; By purchasing in batches during a downtrend, the average cost per share is reduced, creating conditions for future profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Positioning:&lt;/strong&gt; Establishing positions before the market reverses can yield larger gains when the market rebounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; If the stock price continues to fall, it could lead to greater losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Tie-Up:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires sufficient capital to support continued covering and may face situations where funds are long-term locked up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to ‚Äúlong-side trading,‚Äù which involves buying after the market trend is clear and there are signs of a price rebound, the short-side strategy carries lower risk but may miss out on some initial gains during a rally. Therefore, investors should choose a suitable trading strategy based on their risk tolerance, financial situation, and market judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory&#34;&gt;Valuation Theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuation theory is a core concept in finance that aims to assess the intrinsic value of assets or companies, providing a basis for investment decisions. Through valuation, investors can determine whether the current market price of an asset is reasonable and develop appropriate investment strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Valuation Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by an asset over its future period and discounts these cash flows to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The DCF method emphasizes intrinsic value and is suitable for evaluating companies with stable and predictable earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative Valuation Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method assesses a company‚Äôs relative value by comparing it to other companies in the same industry based on valuation metrics such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, and Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio. The relative valuation method is straightforward and widely used for quick assessments and industry comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asset-Based Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method determines a company‚Äôs value by evaluating its net asset value ‚Äì the total assets minus liabilities. The asset-based method is suitable for asset-oriented companies, such as real estate firms or capital-intensive businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications of Valuation Theory:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Decisions:&lt;/strong&gt; Through valuation, investors can identify undervalued or overvalued assets and develop buy or sell strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate Mergers &amp;amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;amp;A):&lt;/strong&gt; In M&amp;amp;A transactions, valuation is key to determining the transaction price and influences the success or failure of the deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Reporting:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies need to assess the fair value of their assets and liabilities to ensure the accuracy and transparency of financial statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs important to note that valuation results are influenced by various factors, including market conditions, company operations, and macroeconomic indicators. Therefore, when conducting a valuation, it is necessary to consider these factors in combination with both qualitative and quantitative analysis to achieve more accurate assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No coding, design and develop a self-selected stock module.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/design-develop-custom-stock-module-no-code/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:20:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/design-develop-custom-stock-module-no-code/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last month, we experimented with cursor, but due to the limitations of the free quota, we didn&amp;rsquo;t develop overly complex features; we just did some basic testing. We discovered then that Byte also released similar products, both using the same large models ‚Äì Claude-3.5 ‚Äì at their core.
Byte‚Äôs product is called Trae, initially launched in the Mac version and finally released its Windows version in February of this year. Big companies are good because you can freely ‚ÄúwhiteÂ´ñ‚Äù (literally translates to &amp;ldquo;free-eat&amp;rdquo;), without having to pay, with unlimited use of Claude-3.5 ‚Äì this model performs quite well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we got stuck on the development of candlestick charts. As I don‚Äôt understand React at all, I had to give up. To continue developing, I would need to supplement my knowledge of front-end basics, breaking down the task into smaller, more manageable pieces instead of directly giving me a large task: developing candlestick charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;issues-found&#34;&gt;Issues Found
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the lack of training data caused by using foreign AI models and Vue3 + Element-Plus, React was chosen as the frontend framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasional syntax errors may exist and require manual fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solutions for some complex problems require manual guidance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code structure optimization requires manual instruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most time-consuming part was packaging the frontend code into a container, due to my zero foundation in &lt;code&gt;.env.production&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt;, I had no concept of these either; I only straightened out the corresponding logic by asking for help from bean sprouts halfway through. There are significant differences between the dev mode and build mode of frontend development, and the checks performed on the code. Backend database and service container scripts were completed in a total of five minutes.
&lt;strong&gt;Currently, AI mainly improves the efficiency of development; having a foundation is best, not that AI will solve all problems for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;repository-address&#34;&gt;Repository Address
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the title indicates, this time we‚Äôre going to try a chat-based approach with AI instead of writing code, aiming to design and develop a self-trading module. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what results we can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repository address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/trae-demo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/ttf248/trae-demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the README.md file in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository contains numerous submission records, most of which are dialogues between me and Trae, along with my testing of Trae‚Äôs functionalities, and notes on whether manual intervention was required to implement each feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt&#34;&gt;Prompt
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project is to develop functionality from scratch, based on the following project prototype diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;Based on the project prototype diagram, develop features: stock selection (watchlist), which needs to support adding, deleting, modifying, and querying contracts. The watchlist interface should display basic market data. Support multiple different market switches.

Frontend: react
Backend: golang gin gorm
Database: PostgreSQL

The backend needs to support cross-origin requests, while also considering data validation and error handling. If the backend service is unavailable, the frontend should display an alert message.

The backend needs to display request and response logs; the frontend also prints communication logs for troubleshooting purposes.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ui-and-interaction-optimization&#34;&gt;UI and Interaction Optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design of the front-end interface relies entirely on Grok. We initially created a prototype within Trae, but it lacked aesthetics. Because the model used has strong coding capabilities but weaker other abilities, we need to use Grok to optimize the front-end UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking screenshots of the current interface and uploading them to Grok, we can receive numerous optimization suggestions at once. We then manually evaluate these suggestions and copy them into Trae to execute and observe the results of the optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;technology-stack&#34;&gt;Technology Stack
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend: React + TypeScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backend: Golang + Gin + GORM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database: PostgreSQL 17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;system-architecture&#34;&gt;System Architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;backend-architecture&#34;&gt;Backend Architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backend utilizes the Gin framework (Go) to implement RESTful APIs, with the following key modules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database Module&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilizes GORM as an ORM framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports database connection configuration via environment variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically performs database schema migrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routing Module&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESTful API design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A unified error handling mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in request logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Origin Handling&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports cross-origin requests from local development environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configurable CORS policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports cookie-based cross-origin access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;frontend-architecture&#34;&gt;Frontend Architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frontend was built using React + TypeScript, implementing the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock list display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watchlist management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-time quote data display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error handling mechanism&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>AI Development Over Two Years: Somewhat similar to the state before a Docker release ‚Äì fragmented and rapidly evolving.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-like-docker-pre-release/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:16:37 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-like-docker-pre-release/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been one of the most hotly debated topics in the technology field in recent years, particularly over the past two years, with AI technology experiencing rapid advancements. Whether it‚Äôs deep learning, natural language processing, or computer vision and automated decision systems, the application scenarios for AI are constantly emerging. However, despite continuous technological breakthroughs, AI still faces a bottleneck similar to that of a Docker release ‚Äì a lack of a killer app to truly ignite the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article: AI has developed for two years, which is somewhat like the state of Docker‚Äôs pre-release, lacking a killer application, based on existing technologies, create a perfect landing scenario, Docker did not use too many new technologies, but the overall solution is reasonable, and it changes the workflow of operations and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-development-status-the-technology-is-mature-but-applications-still-need-breakthroughs&#34;&gt;AI Development Status: The Technology is Mature, but Applications Still Need Breakthroughs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, AI has made significant progress in the past two years. Whether it‚Äôs OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT series models or Google‚Äôs BERT and DeepMind‚Äôs Alpha series, AI processing capabilities have far exceeded previous expectations. Particularly in the field of natural language processing, models like GPT-4 not only possess powerful generative abilities but also demonstrate astonishing performance in understanding and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite technological advancements, AI&amp;rsquo;s implementation in practical applications faces certain challenges. Similar to Docker‚Äôs state before its release, although AI has enormous potential, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet been a truly widespread and industry-changing killer app. People are talking about the prospects of AI, but they may not be able to find an application that can directly bring about revolutionary changes. Many AI applications remain in their initial stages of experimentation, and most require further integration and optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker-and-ai-parallels-technology-doesnt-have-to-be-innovation-its-about-the-solution&#34;&gt;Docker and AI Parallels: Technology Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Have to Be Innovation, It‚Äôs About the Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at Docker‚Äôs release history, we can readily see many similarities between the technological environment at the time and the current state of AI development. Before Docker, container technology wasn‚Äôt a new concept; early technologies like LXC (Linux Containers) and virtualization already possessed the basic capabilities for containerization. However, Docker didn&amp;rsquo;t introduce disruptive technology itself. Instead, it presented a simpler, more intuitive, and efficient solution through the clever integration and optimization of existing technologies. This solution didn‚Äôt rely on revolutionary technological breakthroughs, but rather addressed many pain points in software deployment, scaling, and management processes, significantly simplifying the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the AI field is facing a similar situation. While current AI technology isn&amp;rsquo;t ‚Äúnew,‚Äù achieving truly large-scale applications still requires a perfect implementation scenario ‚Äì just like Docker, integrating and optimizing existing technologies to form a reasonable application solution. Killer AI applications may not rely on entirely new technological breakthroughs, but rather on how to integrate existing technologies to solve practical business pain points and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-ais-docker-moment&#34;&gt;How to Find AI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Docker Moment&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly enable the widespread adoption of AI technology, we need to focus on several key areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Exploration of Practical Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;
Currently, many AI applications are still largely experimental and lack large-scale real-world implementation.  For example, while AI customer service and intelligent recommendations are widely used, their functionality is often limited and hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet broken through industry bottlenecks. True breakthroughs may come from industries that have been struggling with traditional methods for a long time, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics. AI can help these companies improve efficiency and reduce costs in complex scenarios through more efficient data processing and predictive analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productization and Ease of Use&lt;/strong&gt;
Just like Docker simplifies containerization processes to boost operational efficiency, the ease of use of AI products is equally crucial. The widespread adoption of AI isn&amp;rsquo;t just about technological proliferation; it‚Äôs also about product proliferation. Integrating AI into daily workflows, allowing users to easily utilize these tools without needing to deeply understand the technology, is a key step in AI implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecosystem Building and Standardization&lt;/strong&gt;
Any new technology‚Äôs widespread adoption relies on ecosystem building. Docker&amp;rsquo;s rapid rise was due to its openness and compatibility, enabling developers to seamlessly integrate with various cloud platforms, tools, and services. Similarly, the future of AI depends on the construction of an ecosystem.  Standardization of AI, model sharing, data openness, and technological interoperability will all influence whether AI can form widespread industry applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-the-future-of-ai-is-full-of-possibilities-but-requires-more-refined-implementation&#34;&gt;Conclusion: The Future of AI is Full of Possibilities, but Requires More Refined Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant advancements in AI technology over the past two years, it remains in the stage of ‚Äúlacking killer applications‚Äù at present. Similar to containerization technology before Docker‚Äôs release, AI needs a reasonable application scenario that deeply integrates existing technologies with business requirements to truly achieve large-scale adoption and widespread use. While technological innovation is important, solutions that simplify processes and improve efficiency are more likely to drive the popularization and development of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, AI may evolve like Docker ‚Äì not through disruptive technological breakthroughs, but by integrating existing technologies to create a perfect application scenario, ultimately changing the way we work and live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Protobuf Zero Value Pitfalls: When Default Values Become an Invisible Killer of Business Logic</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/protobuf-zero-value-trap/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:26:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/protobuf-zero-value-trap/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The US stock market has three trading sessions: pre-market, live market, and post-market. The logic for pushing data ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs full data or numerical increments ‚Äì is optimized to conserve bandwidth (sending as little data as possible). Initially, only the full dataset is sent in the first transmission; subsequent transmissions are incremental updates of all fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not use the optimal solution? This involves multiple project teams, some of which have been live for many years. As we‚Äôre a new integration, we can only strive for compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-series-of-issues&#34;&gt;A Series of Issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just from the summary, it might seem like there aren&amp;rsquo;t any problems, but once the system architecture is brought in, a series of issues arise. Immediately after resolving the previous issue, a new one emerged ‚Äì this problem was caused by the prior one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unable-to-identify-trading-intervals&#34;&gt;Unable to Identify Trading Intervals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market phase is defined in &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; as 0, but due to incremental push data delivery, the business side cannot effectively identify whether this &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; represents the default value or a genuine business value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms: Each time a &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; is received, it‚Äôs impossible to determine if it‚Äôs the new market phase setting or the &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; default value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introducing-optional&#34;&gt;Introducing Optional
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since protobuf release 3.15, proto3 supports using the optional keyword (just as in proto2) to provide presence information for a scalar field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group‚Äôs communication protocol is based on &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;, but due to historical reasons, the version selected was older and did not support the &lt;code&gt;optional&lt;/code&gt; keyword. As you know, because we introduced &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; from the ground up, publishing the project as a static library, this resulted in needing to upgrade the entire build chain, which was a very high cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gcc-version-issues&#34;&gt;GCC Version Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After painstakingly devising a solution, we planned to release two different underlying versions to control the propagation of dependencies for the new &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; version as much as possible. However, during compilation, we discovered that the &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version was too low and did not support the new features of &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commonly used server types in our team are CentOS7 and CentOS8. The default &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version on CentOS7 is 4.8, while the default &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version on CentOS8 is 8.3. Since the new features of &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; require a &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version of 7.4 or higher, CentOS7 could not support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=82461&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bug 82461 - [7 Regression] Temporary required for brace-initializing (non-literal-type) member variable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, after a lot of troubleshooting, we moved the deployments of related services and the compilation server to CentOS8, resolving this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reasonable-enumeration&#34;&gt;Reasonable Enumeration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the entire problem, there‚Äôs a simpler and more efficient solution: adjust the enumeration definition to start numbering from 1 instead of 0. This effectively distinguishes between default values and business values, avoiding all the aforementioned issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-starting-from-1-is-more-reasonable&#34;&gt;Why Starting from 1 is More Reasonable?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;, enum types have a default value fixed to 0. If we define meaningful business values as 0 (e.g., &amp;ldquo;Market Open&amp;rdquo;), in incremental pushes, the business side cannot determine whether the received 0 is a business value or an unset default value. However, if the enum starts from 1, 0 can be reserved for a meaningless default value or ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù state, solving the problem directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended Practice:
When designing &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; enums, always define 0 as a meaningless default value (e.g., &lt;code&gt;UNKNOWN&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;RESERVED&lt;/code&gt;).
Assign actual business values starting from 1 to ensure they are distinguished from the default value of 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this small adjustment, we not only resolved the issue of identifying market hours but also provided a valuable lesson for future protocol design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Golden Week and National Day holiday periods saw the stock market‚Äôs ‚Äúice and fire dichotomy‚Äù: dramatic swings between soaring gains and sharp declines.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/stock-market-rollercoaster-ahead-of-national-day/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:42:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/stock-market-rollercoaster-ahead-of-national-day/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the eve of China‚Äôs National Day in 2024, the stock market experienced a remarkable surge, attracting widespread attention. However, following the holiday, the market unexpectedly turned to a dramatic plunge. This ‚Äúpolarization‚Äù of the stock market ‚Äì a rollercoaster ride between soaring highs and plummeting lows ‚Äì not only subjected investors to a heart-pounding experience but also prompted deep reflection on policy, economics, and market fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Insert relevant news snippets and data visualizations here - this section would be populated with actual content for a blog post]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-national-day-stock-market-surge-a-policy-driven-frenzy&#34;&gt;Pre-National Day Stock Market Surge: A Policy-Driven Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the five trading days leading up to National Day, China‚Äôs stock market surged from a slump into ‚Äúboiling mode.‚Äù On September 30th, the A-share market saw a full-scale rally with all indices hitting historic highs. The Shanghai Composite Index rose by 8.06%, the Shenzhen Component Index increased by 10.67%, and the Innovation Board China Advanced Index soared by 15.36%, while the STAR 50 Index achieved its largest single-day rise in history, jumping 22.84%. Market sentiment was extremely exuberant, with daily trading volumes across the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Northern Exchanges reaching RMB 2611.5 billion, a significant increase of RMB 11559 billion compared to the previous day. More than 5300 stocks on the main board rallied collectively, creating a ‚Äúsea of red.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core driver behind this rally was the concentrated release of a series of unexpectedly positive policies by the government and the resulting changes in market expectations. On September 24th, the People‚Äôs Bank of China announced a cut in the reserve requirement ratio and interest rates, reducing existing mortgage loan interest rates and standardizing the minimum down payment ratios. The Politburo Standing Committee&amp;rsquo;s meeting on September 26th emphasized the need to intensify counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policy adjustments to boost capital markets and actively guide medium and long-term funds into the market. On September 30th, a series of real estate support policies were released. These measures conveyed the government‚Äôs determination to stabilize the market and promote growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-national-day-stock-market-plunge-calm-and-adjustment-after-the-frenzy&#34;&gt;Post-National Day Stock Market Plunge: Calm and Adjustment After the Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, following the National Day holiday, market sentiment plummeted dramatically. On October 8th, the A-share market opened strongly with nearly a limit-up rise, but after a significant high opening, the market experienced violent fluctuations, ultimately closing down after opening higher. From then on, the market‚Äôs center of gravity continuously shifted downwards, and as of October 16th, the Shanghai Composite Index (HSI) rose and fell by more than 15%, with a cumulative decline of over 470 points. From October 8th to 10th, core A-share indices all declined, with the Shenzhen Component Index falling by 6.21%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this plunge were multifaceted, on one hand, digesting the accumulated risks from the rapid rise in the previous period, and on the other hand, related to adjustments in market expectations regarding policy. Some investors believed that the short-term effects of policies had become apparent, but the long-term impact still needed observation. Furthermore, volatility in global markets also impacted A-shares. On October 9th, the Hang Seng Index plunged by 9.41%, and A50 futures fell by 10.4%, further exacerbating the market‚Äôs decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflection-and-outlook-on-the-market&#34;&gt;Reflection and Outlook on the Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dramatic volatility in the stock market around National Day highlighted a deep reflection among investors regarding policy, economics, and market fundamentals. On one hand, the short-term stimulus effects of policies were significant, but their long-term impact remains to be observed. On the other hand, the rapid rise and fall of the market served as a reminder for investors to maintain rationality and avoid emotional investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, whether A-shares can usher in a genuine ‚Äúlong bull‚Äù market depends on whether policy can effectively transmit to the real economy and ultimately drive substantive improvements in economic fundamentals. Investors should closely monitor the specific implementation of policies and changes in economic data to rationally adjust their investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp rises and falls in the stock market around National Day were a game between policy and the market, and also a test of investors‚Äô mentality. In this ‚Äútwo-pronged‚Äù market environment, we saw the power of the market and the influence of policy. How the market will unfold in the future remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Spring Festival box office *Ne Zha* goes viral/breaks out</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ne-zha-breaks-through-during-spring-festival/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:40:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ne-zha-breaks-through-during-spring-festival/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation of the provided Chinese text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As Chinese people, every Spring Festival, we gather with our families for reunion dinners and watching movies has become an indispensable entertainment activity. This year‚Äôs Spring Festival box office hit, &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt;, exploded out of its niche, sparking discussions on streets and in alleys. The scale is impressive, reminiscent of the previous blockbuster, &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, carrying a strong patriotic theme that inexplicably evokes a sense of national pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article, topic: The explosive popularity of &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt; at the Spring Festival box office, the inexplicable sense of national pride, similar to older films like &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, with a patriotic theme. While there has been significant progress, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t reached this level. As gamers, many aspects seem greasy, and the combat scenes are heavily influenced by online games. There have already been people who bought movie tickets for &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt; but didn‚Äôt actually watch it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-combat-scene-lacked-texture&#34;&gt;The Combat Scene Lacked Texture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a gamer, I‚Äôm usually immersed in various online worlds. Because of this, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have high expectations for movies. However, with the huge popularity of &lt;em&gt;The Battle Between Heaven and Earth&lt;/em&gt;, everyone around me was talking about it, so I thought I‚Äôd take a look. When I entered the cinema, as soon as the scene came on screen, my heart sank. Although the visuals were noticeably improved compared to previous films, some scenes looked a bit greasy. Specifically, the combat scenes felt too heavily influenced by games; you know, like the style was too much like what I‚Äôve seen in video games. Having played so many years of games, the visual style and certain scenes reminded me too strongly of those in games, lacking the texture that a film should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crazy-fanatics&#34;&gt;Crazy Fanatics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the movie, I went out to see what was happening online. Turns out, quite a few people said they bought tickets for &lt;em&gt;The Soul of the Demon&lt;/em&gt; purely to boost its box office revenue. This is impressive ‚Äì I have to admit I‚Äôm somewhat impressed! It seems that everyone&amp;rsquo;s enthusiasm and support for this film is incredibly high, and they were willing to do something for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storyline&#34;&gt;Storyline
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs reflect on it: back when ‚ÄúThe Battle of Wukong‚Äù came out, Wu Jing shouted ‚ÄúAnyone who dares to harm China will be punished, no matter how far away,‚Äù and countless people felt a surge of patriotism, thinking our Chinese military was incredibly powerful and our country immensely strong. Although ‚ÄúThe White Dragon‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have such a direct patriotic slogan, it vividly portrays traditional Chinese culture. Characters like Nezha and Ao Bing, figures we&amp;rsquo;ve grown up hearing stories about since childhood, are brought to life with their feuds, romances, and growth journeys in the film ‚Äì this is precisely the charm of Chinese culture, isn‚Äôt it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs take Nezha as an example. He was misunderstood and ostracized from a young age, but he refused to give up, shouting ‚ÄúMy destiny is not determined by heaven, but by myself,‚Äù which resonates so strongly with the resilience deep within every Chinese person. No matter what difficulties we face, we don&amp;rsquo;t bow down; we change our fate through our own efforts. Ao Bing is similar, carrying the burden of his family‚Äôs mission, appearing cold on the surface but possessing a kind heart, and sacrificing himself for his friends. This friendship, this sense of responsibility ‚Äì aren‚Äôt we often able to see these things in real life too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advancements-in-animated-films&#34;&gt;Advancements in Animated Films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;The Fire on the Mountain&lt;/em&gt; (Nezha) had some imperfections, it effectively combined traditional Chinese culture with modern film technology, allowing us to see significant progress in Chinese animated films. Just as &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated China‚Äôs breakthrough in the action film genre. This kind of advancement makes us feel that Chinese cinema can rise to prominence on the international stage and allows foreigners to witness the brilliance of Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chinese people, no matter where we go, we carry our nation and culture within us. Films like &lt;em&gt;Nezha&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt; are like keys that unlock the deep-seated sense of national pride within us. They allow us to feel the strength of our country and the charm of our culture amidst laughter and joy, while also inspiring us to work hard in our respective roles to contribute to the prosperity and flourishing of our nation. That‚Äôs probably why these films went viral and were able to evoke a sense of national pride within us. In the future, we hope for more films like this to appear, allowing this feeling of national pride to remain full and abundant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Background Service TCP Communication Anomaly Troubleshooting</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:54:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Business Model: The backend service establishes a connection with the group‚Äôs market data gateway using TCP. Each time a connection is established, it must first send an authorization request and then continuously send heartbeat packages to maintain the connection status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one day, an alert message was received indicating that the service had disconnected. After carefully examining the logs, it was discovered that the backend service was continuously sending heartbeat packages, but the other party did not respond at all, yet the connection remained open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;field-summary&#34;&gt;Field Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was originally working in the office, pushing project progress, when an alarm message suddenly popped up in the company group. At first glance, I thought it was just a recurring issue ‚Äì likely due to network timeouts causing heartbeat failures, leading to service disconnection. However, after careful log examination, the actual situation turned out to be different. The backend had sent an authorization login message, but hadn‚Äôt received a response; meanwhile, heartbeat packets continued to send persistently, yet the other party never replied with any heartbeat data. After in-depth analysis of the logs, several key issues were exposed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Response to Authorization Message:&lt;/strong&gt; This was likely due to the other system being in the process of restarting, preventing the authorization message from being processed promptly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sending Heartbeat Data Without Successful Authorization:&lt;/strong&gt; Upon investigation, it was found that this was a logical flaw in the program‚Äôs logic. The heartbeat sending function&amp;rsquo;s judgment logic had a defect; it only checked the connection status but missed verifying the authorization status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Did Not Disconnect:&lt;/strong&gt; If the service could have disconnected, it would have triggered a reconnection mechanism and re-sent the authorization message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there‚Äôs one remaining critical issue that needs to be resolved ‚Äì why didn&amp;rsquo;t the service disconnect? Solving this problem requires more in-depth and detailed troubleshooting work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analyzing-network-packets&#34;&gt;Analyzing Network Packets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; is a very powerful network packet capture tool that can be used to capture network packets. By analyzing network packets, we can gain a more intuitive understanding of the details of network communication. Here, we can use &lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; to capture network packets for further analysis.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/20250220151952.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1126&#34;
	height=&#34;202&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;tcpdump&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;557&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;1337px&#34;
	
&gt;
Analyzing the data in the diagram, I see that the heartbeat is constantly being sent normally, and the other server did not respond with any data, but it sent an &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;, which prevents the connection from disconnecting proactively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;common-flag-bit-explanations&#34;&gt;Common Flag Bit Explanations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the TCP protocol, &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; (Push) and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; (Acknowledgment) are two important flag bits used to control data transmission and traffic confirmation, respectively. Their functions are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-psh-push-flag&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. PSH (Push Flag)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; flag‚Äôs purpose is to &lt;strong&gt;request that the receiver immediately push data from its buffer to the upper-layer application&lt;/strong&gt; (rather than waiting for the buffer to fill). This means that once a data segment with the &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; flag is received, the receiver will process and transmit it as quickly as possible to the application, rather than storing it in an operating system buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical Scenarios:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP/HTTPS Requests:&lt;/strong&gt; Clients setting the &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; when sending requests (e.g., &lt;code&gt;GET /index.html&lt;/code&gt;) to ensure immediate response from the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSH Protocol:&lt;/strong&gt; Each keystroke triggers a &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt;, ensuring real-time transmission of input characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Time Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; Low-latency scenarios like video streaming or online games may utilize &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; to reduce latency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; is not mandatory; the receiver can choose to ignore this flag (but still process the data normally).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sender may not set &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt;, in which case the receiver will determine when to push data based on its own buffering strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-ack-acknowledgment-flag&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. ACK (Acknowledgment Flag)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function:&lt;/strong&gt; The ACK flag indicates that &lt;strong&gt;the previous data segment has been correctly received&lt;/strong&gt;. Each ACK contains an acknowledgment number (Acknowledgment Number), which represents the next byte sequence expected to be received. It is the core mechanism of TCP reliable transmission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Principle:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the sender sends a data segment, it carries the expected ACK value from the receiver (e.g., &lt;code&gt;ACK = Sequence Number + Data Length&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon receiving the data, the receiver generates an ACK message to confirm the received byte sequence number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sender only retransmits unacknowledged data after receiving the corresponding ACK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the sender sends a data segment with sequence numbers &lt;code&gt;100~199&lt;/code&gt;, then the expected ACK from the receiver should be &lt;code&gt;200&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the receiver has not received some of the data in &lt;code&gt;100~199&lt;/code&gt;, it will inform the sender to retransmit via &lt;code&gt;ACK=150&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-combination-of-psh-and-ack&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Combination of PSH and ACK&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the TCP header, &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; can appear simultaneously, commonly seen in the following scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP Request Response&lt;/strong&gt;:
When a client sends a &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request (including data), it sets both &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; (to acknowledge previous responses).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command Transfer after SSH Handshake&lt;/strong&gt;:
After the client enters a command, it sends a data segment with &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; to ensure that the command is immediately transmitted and processed by the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-other-flagged-associations&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Other Flagged Associations&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;URG&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Urgent&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Marks an urgent pointer (rarely used)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-other-flagged-associations-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Other Flagged Associations&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSH&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on &lt;strong&gt;data arriving at the application layer as quickly as possible&lt;/strong&gt;, reducing latency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACK&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on &lt;strong&gt;reliable data transmission&lt;/strong&gt;, avoiding packet loss or out-of-order delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two work together to balance TCP protocol efficiency and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>‚ÄúMaking an investment and making money isn‚Äôt urgent, and even if you‚Äôre anxious, it won‚Äôt help.‚Äù</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:30:24 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on years of stock trading experiences, although I didn‚Äôt make a fortune, I also didn&amp;rsquo;t lose too much. The biggest issue was an unreasonable allocation of funds and an unstable mindset. Currently, my primary source of income is work, earning a fixed salary each day through part-time jobs. My ability to withstand financial fluctuations remains at the level of bonds and bank deposits. However, people are inherently greedy; if you buy too little, even when prices rise, you won‚Äôt make money; if you buy too much, you will lose money. At this point, maintaining a stable mindset is particularly important, as it can help us keep our wealth afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article: Addressing the mental issues in stock trading finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-loss-cases&#34;&gt;Historical Loss Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the initial entry into the market, I encountered small-cap and near-new stocks. Later, I focused on blue-chip large-cap stocks: Industrial Bank, China Unicom, Hong Kong Electronics, ZTESC, and various large-stock index funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúExpected annualized returns were touted as matching a bank‚Äôs three-year fixed deposit,‚Äù but in reality, there was greed wanting more, leading to hasty increases from the beginning, followed by depletion of cash flow. Purchases of insurance, real estate, and weddings represented significant outflows of capital, resulting in insufficient liquidity overall, causing problems later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in blue chips is like aligning with ‚Äúold money‚Äù:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Evergrande faced issues, bank stocks plummeted dramatically, successfully capitalizing on the washout phase. This reflects a lack of understanding regarding the economic impact of real estate, which accounts for a significant portion of China‚Äôs economy, and it was impossible to ‚Äúforce a landing.‚Äù The subsequent sustained decline in the stock market saw blue-chip stocks like Industrial Bank continue to rise for about two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the initial stages of trade wars, ZTESC suffered severe damage, with its stock price also falling sharply. It has since gradually recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Electronics, a long-standing company, experienced a significant drop in its stock price after Ant Financial‚Äôs departure, but this stock was manipulated by a major shareholder, allowing it to surge upwards several times per year. With reasonable position sizing, losses could be minimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;greed-the-monster-that-devours-reason&#34;&gt;Greed: The &amp;ldquo;Monster&amp;rdquo; That Devours Reason
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greed is the most common problem in a stock trading mindset. When stock prices rise steadily, and investors‚Äô account profits continuously increase, greed quietly takes root. Many people still fantasize about continued price increases even when stocks are already at high levels, craving more gains and unwilling to cut their profits. They are blinded by greed, forgetting the laws of the market and the existence of risk. For example, during the hype of certain hot-themed stocks, some investors see prices double or even multiply within a short period, falling into it, constantly adding to their positions, hoping to be the last winner. However, the market will not always go crazy; when the bubble bursts and stock prices plummet sharply, these investors driven by greed often suffer heavy losses. Greed causes them to lose their ability to rationally analyze and make decisions, turning them into &amp;ldquo;gamblers&amp;rdquo; in the stock market rather than wise investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-the-chain-that-restricts&#34;&gt;Fear: The ‚ÄúChain‚Äù That Restricts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is the counterpart to greed. It possesses a powerful destructive force in the stock market as well. When market conditions suddenly plummet and stock prices fall sharply, investors are prone to panic. This fear erodes their confidence in the market, even when the fundamentals of their holdings are sound, leading them to hastily sell off their shares out of a fear of further losses. For example, during periods of global financial crises, even high-quality blue-chip stocks saw significant declines alongside the broader market. Some investors were consumed by fear and failed to recognize the long-term value of these companies, selling their stock at extremely low prices and missing out on substantial returns from subsequent market rebounds and company performance growth. Fear not only causes short-term losses for investors but can also create a lasting psychological shadow over the stock market, making them hesitant to re-enter, thus losing out on investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blind-following-losing-direction-in-the-fog&#34;&gt;Blind Following: Losing Direction in the &amp;ldquo;Fog&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stock trading and wealth management, blindly following trends is another psychological pitfall that investors easily fall into. In an era of information explosion, various investment suggestions, market rumors, and hot topics are rampant. Many investors lack independent thinking and judgment abilities, blindly following others&amp;rsquo; operations. When they see their peers making money by buying a particular stock, they immediately follow suit without further thought; when they hear so-called &amp;ldquo;insider news,&amp;rdquo; they readily share it. This blind following behavior ignores the research and analysis of the underlying stocks, causing investors to be like lost ships in the fog, losing their own direction. For example, some concept stocks can indeed generate short-term profits for followers during market hype. However, as the hype fades and stock prices plummet, those who are unaware and blindly follow will become &amp;ldquo;cash absorbers.&amp;rdquo; They didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that everyone‚Äôs risk tolerance, investment goals, and investment horizons are different, and a strategy suitable for others may not be suitable for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overconfidence-the-hidden-shallow&#34;&gt;Overconfidence: The Hidden &amp;ldquo;Shallow&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence is also a significant issue in the investment and financial mindset. Some investors, after achieving several successful investments, begin to inflate their egos, believing they have mastered market patterns and can accurately predict stock movements. They ignore the complexity and uncertainty of the market, engage in excessive trading, blindly expand their investment scale, and even use high leverage for speculation. However, the market is ever-changing, and overconfident investors often suffer severe setbacks in a single unexpected market fluctuation. For example, some investors with limited experience who achieved an initial victory believe they possess professional investment capabilities and begin to frequently buy and sell stocks, constantly increasing their investment amount. When systemic risks or sudden negative news about individual stocks emerge, they fail to cut their losses promptly due to overconfidence, leading to a significant reduction in their principal capital. Overconfidence is like hidden reefs beneath the surface of the water ‚Äì seemingly peaceful and harmless, but can unexpectedly cause an investor&amp;rsquo;s wealth vessel to run aground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-for-stable-financial-planning&#34;&gt;How to Adjust Your Mindset for Stable Financial Planning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish the Right Investment Philosophy:&lt;/strong&gt; Investors should clearly understand that stock investing and wealth management are about achieving long-term, stable asset appreciation, not overnight riches. By learning investment knowledge, understanding market patterns, adopting value investing and long-term investment philosophies, and avoiding being swayed by short-term gains and market sentiment, you can make more informed decisions. For example, thoroughly research a company‚Äôs fundamentals, paying attention to its profitability, industry position, management team, and other relevant factors, choosing stocks with long-term investment potential rather than blindly chasing short-term trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a Reasonable Investment Plan:&lt;/strong&gt; Based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals, create a scientific and reasonable investment plan. Clearly define key elements such as investment amount, investment period, expected returns, and stop-loss points, and strictly execute the plan. This prevents impulsive decisions driven by emotional fluctuations during investing. For example, set the investment proportion of each stock to no more than a certain percentage of your total assets, and promptly take profits when the price rises to your expected return, and decisively cut losses when it falls to your stop-loss point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control Your Emotions and Stay Calm:&lt;/strong&gt; When facing market volatility, learn to control your emotions and maintain calmness and rationality. You can relieve investment pressure through methods such as diverting attention, engaging in physical exercise, or communicating with others, avoiding negative impacts of emotions on investment decisions. When the market experiences significant fluctuations, first calmly analyze the reasons, combine your investment strategy and stock fundamentals, and make rational judgments instead of blindly following trends or panic selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue Learning and Reflecting:&lt;/strong&gt; The stock market is constantly evolving, so investors need to continuously learn new investment knowledge and skills, pay attention to macroeconomic conditions, industry dynamics, and company information, and constantly improve their investment level. At the same time, regularly reflect on your investment behavior, summarize experiences and lessons, identify problems in your mindset and decision-making, and promptly adjust and improve them. For example, after each investment, review the entire investment process, analyze the reasons for success and failure, and think about how to avoid similar mistakes in future investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth management is a long and challenging journey, and mindset plays a crucial role. Only by maintaining rational, calm, humble, and independent thinking can you steadily advance in the stock market‚Äôs waves and achieve wealth preservation and appreciation. Investors should consider cultivating their mindset as an essential course in the investment process, using a good mindset to steer the ship of wealth, and moving forward steadily on the path of stock investing and wealth management.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Echoes of bygone years, offering unconventional fantasies and emotional solace.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the earliest web novel readers entered middle age, the type of ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù stories catered to them also evolved. The protagonists often appeared as fathers, mentors, or elderly figures, meeting the different needs and demands of middle-aged readers for life and emotion. These works no longer solely focused on upgrades and reversals; instead, they emphasized emotional resonance and life reflections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;target-audience-shifting-reader-base-amidst-the-passage-of-time&#34;&gt;Target Audience: Shifting Reader Base Amidst the Passage of Time
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former web novel readers have largely transitioned into middle age. They‚Äôve experienced the trials and tribulations of life, leading to shifts in their mindset and values. The passionate, adventurous elements they once chased are no longer the sole focus for them. Instead, they seek emotional resonance with their current lives and a sense of nostalgia for past years, as well as aspirations for the future. Middle-agedÁàΩÊñá (shuangwen - a popular genre) emerged specifically to meet this psychological need. It utilizes plot settings that closely align with the lives and attitudes of middle-aged readers, attracting this particular demographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;role-shift-from-young-hero-to-middle-aged-guardian&#34;&gt;Role Shift: From Young Hero to Middle-Aged Guardian
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Students Are All Villains:&lt;/strong&gt; The protagonist, Lu Zhou, after becoming a master, faces a group of disciples with diverse personalities and formidable strength. They teeter between good and evil, and Lu Zhou needs to guide them towards the right path. This novel showcases the challenges and confusion faced by middle-aged individuals when educating the next generation through interactions with their disciples. Furthermore, the growth and transformation of the disciples offer hope and a glimpse into the future, mirroring expectations for one‚Äôs children or younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emotional-resonance-life-reflections-and-family-responsibilities&#34;&gt;Emotional Resonance: Life Reflections and Family Responsibilities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sixty-Year-Old Birthday System:&lt;/strong&gt; The protagonist gained a system upon turning sixty, embarking on a new life journey. This setting allows middle-aged readers to feel a sense of ‚Äúit‚Äôs never too late‚Äù hope and inspiration. Even having reached old age, the protagonist can still realize their value and dreams through the system. This plot encourages readers to reflect on missed opportunities and unfulfilled dreams in their own lives, while also conveying an optimistic attitude, encouraging them not to give up pursuing their goals at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-design-aligning-with-the-rhythm-and-humor-of-middle-age-life&#34;&gt;Plot Design: Aligning with the Rhythm and Humor of Middle Age Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot designs for middle-aged ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù novels often place a greater emphasis on the details of life and the nuanced expression of emotions. Unlike young adult revenge novels that prioritize rapid upgrades and adventures, they focus more on relationships between characters and emotional entanglements. For example, in &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Master Craftsman&lt;/em&gt;, the protagonist‚Äôs friendship with his apprentice, their brotherhood with fellow disciples, etc., are all depicted in detail. This plot design allows middle-aged readers to feel a sense of warmth and familiarity, as if they were seeing their own family relationships, friendships, and love lives.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spring Festival Blockbuster Movie Ticket Price Mystery: The Difference Between Online and Offline Prices</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-movie-ticket-price-mystery/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:02:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-movie-ticket-price-mystery/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the Spring Festival, a family of seven or eight people wanted to go see a movie. They originally planned to buy tickets on Taopiaopiao and Maoyan. When they looked at the price, it was 60 yuan. Luckily, they had a cinema recharge card that required them to purchase tickets at the cinema‚Äôs front desk. They thought about asking the front desk if there were any discounts, but unexpectedly, the same showtime cost only 35 yuan when purchased at the front desk. The price difference was quite surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hidden-add-on-of-platform-service-fees&#34;&gt;The ‚ÄúHidden Add-on‚Äù of Platform Service Fees
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While online ticketing platforms are convenient, platform service fees cannot be ignored. They provide users with a seamless booking experience, such as precise seat selection and the ability to view purchase history at any time ‚Äì all of which require investment in maintenance. These costs are then passed on to consumers through increased ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cinema-differentiation-operation-strategies&#34;&gt;Cinema Differentiation Operation Strategies
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the explosive demand for movie-watching during the Spring Festival, cinemas adopted differentiated pricing strategies to maximize revenue. Online platforms have a large volume of traffic, and many people are accustomed to purchasing tickets online in advance; therefore, cinema ticket prices were set higher on these platforms. Conversely, those buying tickets directly at the box office ‚Äì walk-in customers ‚Äì received lower prices to attract this segment of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-price-logic-behind-revenue-sharing&#34;&gt;The Price Logic Behind Revenue Sharing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue sharing models between online platforms and cinemas impact ticket prices. For an online platform to take a slice of the box office revenue ‚Äì in order to maintain profitability ‚Äì they will typically raise ticket prices. Meanwhile, cinema box offices have no intermediary costs, leading to lower prices and more affordable tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consumer-ticket-buying-tips&#34;&gt;Consumer Ticket Buying Tips
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt just look at online platforms when buying tickets. Call the cinema&amp;rsquo;s front desk to inquire about prices, or go directly to the front desk and ask ‚Äì you might find a surprise. If you frequently watch movies, get an auditorium membership card to enjoy member discounts and save money.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Analysis of Political Elements in 2025 Spring Festival Film Releases</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-films-spring-festival-2025/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:49:42 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-films-spring-festival-2025/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been a long time since I went to the Spring Festival movie release to join in the crowds, and this time I watched two films that felt quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the new changes in the 2025 Spring Festival movie releases, focusing on &lt;em&gt;Dwelling in the Fuchun Pavilion&lt;/em&gt; (Tangrenjie Tanjian 1900) and &lt;em&gt;Nezha: The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Child&lt;/em&gt;. The former utilizes the backdrop of San Francisco‚Äôs Chinatown in 1900 to depict the discrimination and oppression faced by Chinese people, reflecting social and political conditions. As an animated film, the latter employs rich metaphorical elements to subtly critique the current international political landscape ‚Äì such as the Jade Palace resembling the Pentagon mirroring the American political system, the dollar symbol on the Heavenly Mandate Throne symbolizing U.S. dollar hegemony, the jade amulet similar to American green cards representing status levels, and the Soul-Devouring Elixir resembling biological weapons reflecting malicious actions. Both films offer a new viewing experience and prompt reflection on the relationship between cinematic art and political expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovation-in-the-style-of-chinese-new-year-film-releases&#34;&gt;Innovation in the Style of Chinese New Year Film Releases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, films released during the Spring Festival often featured lighthearted entertainment and family-friendly themes, aiming to allow audiences to relax and unwind during the holiday season, rarely addressing sensitive political topics. However, in 2025, the Spring Festival release broke with convention; &lt;em&gt;The Mystery Down South 1900&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nezha: Part One&lt;/em&gt; incorporated rich political elements, sparking widespread discussion among viewers and bringing a new atmosphere to the Spring Festival film slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shanghai-noon-1900-a-vivid-depiction-of-political-times&#34;&gt;‚ÄúShanghai Noon 1900‚Äù: A Vivid Depiction of Political Times
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúShanghai Noon 1900‚Äù is set in San Francisco‚Äôs Chinatown in 1900, when Chinese immigrants overseas faced severe racial discrimination and oppression. The protagonists not only have to solve the mystery of the case but also confront discrimination and unfair treatment from all sides of society. The film&amp;rsquo;s portrayal of racism and power struggles accurately reflects the social political environment of that time, allowing us to see the difficult struggle of Chinese immigrants for survival and dignity, and the underlying political issues worth deep consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This historical background inevitably reminds one of the current predicament faced by overseas Chinese in the business sector, such as the TikTok and Zhou Jiayu incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 6, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected TikTok‚Äôs request, ruling that the legally mandated sale law passed by Congress under national security grounds had withstood constitutional scrutiny. TikTok CEO Zhou Jiayu wrote in a memo to employees that the next step would be ‚Äúseeking an injunction and awaiting review by the U.S. Supreme Court.‚Äù The source of this event is the U.S.‚Äôs ‚ÄúProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversarial Control of Applications‚Äù law, which requires ByteDance to divest its TikTok business within 270 days after the law‚Äôs passage, with a final deadline of January 19, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During various hearings, Zhou Jiayu was subjected to numerous difficulties. On January 31, 2024, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on ‚ÄúThe Big Tech Companies and the Online Child Sexual Abuse Crisis,‚Äù with anti-China lawmaker Tom Cotton confronting Zhou Jiayu, repeatedly posing eight questions about his nationality, including asking him what country he was from, whether he had applied for Chinese or American citizenship, even sparing his wife and children‚Äôs nationalities. Despite the hearing&amp;rsquo;s theme being ‚Äúonline child sexual abuse,‚Äù the lawmakers shifted the topic to TikTok being owned by Chinese company ByteDance, forcing Zhou Jiayu to answer irrelevant questions. Just as in ‚ÄúShanghai Noon 1900,‚Äù Chinese people overseas faced unwarranted discrimination, Zhou Jiayu also suffered from unfair treatment and questioning due to the background of TikTok, which is owned by ByteDance. This series of events reflects how, across different eras, overseas Chinese face numerous obstacles when pursuing their own development and safeguarding their rights ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs racial discrimination a century ago or political manipulation in business today, all deserve our deep reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-deer-and-the-phoenix-political-metaphors-hidden-behind-mythology--an-analysis&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Deer and the Phoenix&amp;rdquo;: Political Metaphors Hidden Behind Mythology ‚Äì An Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite appearing as a typical animated film, ‚ÄúThe Deer and the Phoenix‚Äù is replete with political metaphors through its numerous settings and plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping of Power Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; The Yuhuang Palace is molded into the center of supreme power in the celestial realm, with architectural styles resembling the Pentagon, primarily using white tones to symbolize Western hegemony disguised under the banner of ‚Äúuniversal values.‚Äù The ‚ÄúMonster Hunting Squad‚Äù led by Wuliangxian, with its subordinates Lu Ban and He Feizi, are believed to correspond to the US alliance system, including Japan and South Korea. The Yuhuang Palace‚Äôs ‚Äúonline meeting‚Äù scene, with twelve golden immortals discussing the ‚ÄúBattle of Sovereigns,‚Äù is similar to NATO meetings led by the United States, suppressing other countries under the guise of ‚Äúmaintaining order.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hints of Economic Hegemony:&lt;/strong&gt; The Taiyuan Ding used for alchemy in the Yuhuang Palace has a dollar sign at its entrance, symbolizing America‚Äôs use of economic hegemony to ‚Äúrefine‚Äù and exploit resources from other nations. Wuliangxian‚Äôs act of refining dragons into the Ding with the justification of ‚Äúupholding heaven and earth‚Äù is like certain countries using ‚Äúinternational rules‚Äù to pursue their interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metaphors of Identity and Hierarchy:&lt;/strong&gt; The celestial identity amulet granted to Nezha, with its color and pattern design resembling a US green card, symbolizes the celestial realm‚Äôs rejection and hierarchical division of ‚Äúforeign races,‚Äù reflecting real-world differences in identities and unequal treatment between different countries and groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Allusions to Malicious Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; Wuliangxian forcing Nezha to take the Dan of Soul Annihilation, which resembles a bioweapon, darkly alludes to certain countries using the guise of ‚Äúsaving the world‚Äù to carry out destructive and devastating actions against other nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbolism of Resources and Development:&lt;/strong&gt; The Seven Colored Lotus is crucial for reshaping Nezha andÊïñ Peng‚Äôs bodies, symbolizing key energy and technological lifelines monopolized by major powers. Its ‚Äújade nectar and elixir‚Äù must be obtained through the Yuhuang Palace&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;celestial examination,&amp;rdquo; mirroring developing countries‚Äô dependence on core resources and being subjected to ‚Äúrule-based plunder‚Äù under a hegemonic system. The Lotus‚Äô temporary failure and restoration conditions reflect the plight of small nations in energy crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deep-reflections-on-cinematic-art-and-political-expression&#34;&gt;Deep Reflections on Cinematic Art and Political Expression
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These films, amidst the nationwide viewing craze during the Spring Festival, incorporated political elements, offering audiences a new cinematic experience ‚Äì one that moved beyond simple entertainment and served as a mirror reflecting political issues within history and reality. This has prompted us to delve into the relationship between cinematic art and political expression. Will directors in future film creations increasingly convey their perspectives on social and political matters through cinema? As a powerful cultural transmission medium, can film simultaneously engage in artistic expression while also taking greater notice and consideration of societal realities? These questions are worth exploring as we appreciate films, and we look forward to the film industry bringing more exciting integration of art and real-world expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-egg&#34;&gt;Easter Egg
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boabab large model, wasn&amp;rsquo;t performing very well today, it froze several times, the article stopped halfway and couldn‚Äôt continue, so I had to restart the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The two major political parties in the United States ‚Äì the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:40:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Party and the Republican Party exhibit significant differences in political ideology, policy proposals, and social values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;political-ideologies-and-policy-positions&#34;&gt;Political Ideologies and Policy Positions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democratic Party:&lt;/strong&gt; Leans towards liberal/progressive, advocating for the government to play an active role in economic and social affairs, supporting social welfare, environmental protection, and multiculturalism. In tax policy, the Democratic Party supports tax cuts for low- and middle-income individuals while raising taxes on high earners and corporations. On social issues, the Democratic Party supports abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and advocates for strict gun control. In foreign policy, the Democratic Party emphasizes multilateralism and diplomatic means, preferring to address global problems through international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Republican Party:&lt;/strong&gt; Leans towards conservative, advocating for limited government intervention, emphasizing individual liberty and a free market economy. In tax policy, the Republican Party supports tax cuts, believing they should apply to everyone regardless of income. On social issues, the Republican Party opposes abortion and same-sex marriage, supports the right to bear arms. In foreign policy, the Republican Party tends to take a strong stance, supporting the use of military force to protect national interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-significance-of-trumps-second-term&#34;&gt;The Significance of Trump‚Äôs Second Term
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump was re-elected as President of the United States in 2024, marking a continued dominance for the Republican Party within American politics. Trump&amp;rsquo;s policy agenda included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump advocated for stimulating economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation, particularly supporting the development of traditional manufacturing and energy industries. He also favored protectionist trade policies, renegotiating or withdrawing from existing trade agreements to protect America‚Äôs economic interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immigration Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump planned to strengthen border security, restrict illegal immigration, and implement stricter scrutiny and limitations on legal immigrants. He supported limiting refugee and asylum applications to maintain national security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump tended towards unilateralism, emphasizing ‚ÄúAmerica First,‚Äù reducing reliance on international organizations, reevaluating relationships with allies, and employing more assertive diplomatic measures when necessary. He also planned to expand fossil fuel production and use, relaxing restrictions on environmental protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump‚Äôs second term could lead to significant adjustments in U.S. domestic policy and have profound impacts on global politics and economics. His policies are likely to garner attention and responses from the international community, particularly in areas such as trade, environment, and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ollama local deployment of deepseek-R1</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ollama-local-deployment-deepseek-r1/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:41:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ollama-local-deployment-deepseek-r1/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ollama is an open-source AI tool designed to enable users to run and deploy large language models (LLMs) locally. Its goal is to provide a convenient and efficient way for developers to use models like GPT on their local machines without relying on cloud services. Ollama supports multiple models and focuses on optimizing performance, allowing even resource-constrained devices to smoothly run these models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Ollama, users can utilize text-based AI applications and interact with locally deployed models without worrying about data privacy or high API usage fees. You can invoke different models via a command-line interface (CLI) for tasks such as natural language processing and question answering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ollama is suitable for experimenting with various models; after testing the Windows version, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t fully leverage the hardware‚Äôs performance, possibly due to the Windows version. When deploying 32b parameter models, with low memory and GPU load, the response speed is slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hardware-overview&#34;&gt;Hardware Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating System: Windows 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU: i7-10700K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory: 40GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics Card: RTX 3060 12GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;environment-setup&#34;&gt;Environment Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the system environment variable to facilitate subsequent use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_MODELS=E:\ollama&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
This variable specifies the location where Ollama models are stored. &lt;code&gt;E:\ollama&lt;/code&gt; is a folder path indicating that all local model files will be stored in this directory. Ollama will load and use the language models you download or deploy based on this path. You can store model files in other locations by simply changing this path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:8000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
This environment variable sets the host and port for the Ollama service.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; is the localhost address, meaning the Ollama service will only listen for requests from the local machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;8000&lt;/code&gt; is the specified port number, indicating that the Ollama service will wait for and process requests on port 8000. You can change the port number if needed, but make sure it&amp;rsquo;s not already in use by another application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
This environment variable controls which origins are allowed to access the Ollama service.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; indicates that all origins (i.e., all domains and IP addresses) can access the Ollama service. This is typically used in development and debugging environments, and in production environments, it&amp;rsquo;s usually necessary to specify stricter origin control, limiting only specific domains or IPs to access your service for enhanced security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deepseek-r1-model-deployment&#34;&gt;DeepSeek-R1 Model Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ollama installation is straightforward, so we won&amp;rsquo;t detail it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-installation verification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;C:\Users\core&amp;gt;ollama -v
ollama version is 0.5.11
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deploy the model, refer to the official model page and select the appropriate parameter model: &lt;code&gt;ollama run deepseek-r1:14b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 14b parameter version effectively remembers conversation context; smaller parameter versions cannot retain context. The 32b parameter version is very sluggish when deployed locally and hasn&amp;rsquo;t been further tested.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôd gotten used to using zsh on Linux, and when I was writing a blog post the other day, I suddenly realized that PowerShell 7 also supports persistent command-line prediction views, so I tried it out. It turned out to be pretty useful after all.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI don&amp;rsquo;t know what I did to enable this feature, but it just appeared‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;cross-platform-features&#34;&gt;Cross-Platform Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 breaks down platform limitations, allowing you to perform enterprise-level server management on Windows systems, system administration in Linux environments, or daily development tasks on macOS ‚Äì all with a unified PowerShell 7 tool. This significantly increases productivity and reduces the learning curve and operational complexity associated with platform differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;powerful-features&#34;&gt;Powerful Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It possesses powerful scripting capabilities, supporting object-oriented programming, functions, modules, and other advanced programming features. Through PowerShell 7, users can easily operate the file system, create, delete, copy, move, and perform other operations on files and folders; it can access and modify the registry to deeply adjust system configurations; it can manage processes and services to effectively monitor and control the system&amp;rsquo;s running status. Furthermore, PowerShell 7 can interact with various Windows and non-Windows technologies, such as user and permission management in Active Directory and resource allocation and management on the Azure cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-source-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Open Source Ecosystem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 is open source, a feature that allows developers and enthusiasts worldwide to actively participate in its development and improvement. A large number of open-source modules and tools are constantly emerging, enriching the functionality and application scenarios of PowerShell 7. Users can find suitable modules within the open-source community to extend the capabilities of PowerShell 7 or contribute their own code to drive the overall development of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compatibility-and-stability&#34;&gt;Compatibility and Stability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 maintains compatibility with older versions of PowerShell while introducing many new features and improvements. These enhancements not only improve performance but also increase stability, allowing users to complete various tasks more smoothly and reducing disruptions caused by software failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enable-command-line-prediction-view&#34;&gt;Enable Command-Line Prediction View
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the many useful features of PowerShell 7, the &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt; command is a practical tool that enhances the user&amp;rsquo;s command-line input experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the command itself isn‚Äôt necessary to achieve auto-completion, it only provides in-line completion; once enabled, it allows for prediction view, displaying all possible completion options in a list format. Users can then select the desired option using the up and down arrow keys, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of command input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/powershell-7-persisting-settings-commandline-prediction-view/20250207222546.png&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;methods-to-make-commands-persistent&#34;&gt;Methods to Make Commands Persistent
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt; command takes effect every time PowerShell starts, we can add it to PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s profile. A PowerShell profile is a special script that automatically executes its commands when PowerShell launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;determine-configuration-file-path&#34;&gt;Determine Configuration File Path
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In PowerShell, we can use the &lt;code&gt;$PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; variable to view the path of the configuration file. If the file does not exist under that path, users can manually create one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;echo $PROFILE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-configuration-file&#34;&gt;Open Configuration File
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a text editor, such as the powerful Notepad++ or the lightweight Visual Studio Code, to open the file corresponding to the configuration file path obtained through the &lt;code&gt;$PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-command&#34;&gt;Add Command
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the opened configuration file, add the command &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt;. Ensure that the command is written accurately to guarantee that the configuration file takes effect correctly when executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;save-configuration&#34;&gt;Save Configuration
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adding the command, save the configuration file and close the text editor. At this point, the configuration file contains the commands we want to execute every time PowerShell starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;verification-settings&#34;&gt;Verification Settings
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the current PowerShell window and restart PowerShell. In the newly launched PowerShell, when entering commands, the command-line input prediction view style should already be displayed in list view according to our settings, indicating that our settings have been successfully applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these steps, we not only gained a deeper understanding of the powerful features and characteristics of PowerShell 7 but also learned how to use the command-line input prediction view style to enhance the user experience, and how to make these settings persistent. We hope this knowledge can help you operate PowerShell 7 more confidently and efficiently complete various system management and automation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DeepSeek suddenly went viral before the Spring Festival, NVIDIA stock plummeted: The underlying institutional operations and the chain of thought for large models.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-explodes-before-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-plummets-behind-the-scenes-and-large-language-model-reasoning/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:36:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-explodes-before-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-plummets-behind-the-scenes-and-large-language-model-reasoning/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Spring Festival, DeepSeek had become a hot topic, attracting widespread attention on social media in just a few days. This sudden surge in popularity was surprising and triggered a chain reaction in the market. Meanwhile, NVIDIA‚Äôs stock price plummeted, raising concerns among many investors, with some institutions conducting large-scale short selling during this period, seemingly pointing to a ‚Äúcarefully orchestrated‚Äù situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deepseeks-sudden-surge-in-popularity-rapidly-becoming-a-focus&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s Sudden Surge in Popularity: Rapidly Becoming a Focus&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is an AI-powered tool focused on optimizing deep learning models, particularly in the application of natural language processing (NLP) and image generation. In the days leading up to Chinese New Year, this project suddenly attracted significant attention from investors and tech professionals alike. The performance of its team and the demonstrated technical results sparked strong interest among many. Discussions about DeepSeek dominated virtually every topic within the developer community and on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, DeepSeek‚Äôs sudden surge in popularity was not accidental. After analysis, many began to suspect that certain entities were involved behind it. Notably, after its rise to prominence, NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s stock experienced a significant decline, suggesting that some factors were driving this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nvidia-stock-plummets-the-hand-behind-the-short-selling-operation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia Stock Plummets: The Hand Behind the Short Selling Operation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), has long been a key hardware provider for many large models and AI computations. With the rapid development of the AI market, Nvidia‚Äôs stock has performed strongly over the long term and even become a favorite among many investors. However, with the explosive popularity of DeepSeek and the market&amp;rsquo;s intense focus on its technology, Nvidia‚Äôs stock experienced a dramatic plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason behind this phenomenon may involve institutional investor short selling strategies. Over the past few years, as AI technology has spread, Nvidia‚Äôs stock price has been significantly inflated, leading many investors to believe that it was at risk of excessive speculation. Especially after a technology like DeepSeek went viral, some institutions may have profited by shorting Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock. By accurately grasping market timing and predicting the influence of DeepSeek, these institutions successfully made a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;large-model-chain-of-thought-interaction-from-results-to-process&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Model Chain-of-Thought Interaction: From ‚ÄúResults‚Äù to ‚ÄúProcess‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In traditional AI applications, many practitioners and investors have focused more on the &amp;ldquo;results&amp;rdquo; of AI models ‚Äì such as generated images and text ‚Äì direct outputs. However, in discussions related to DeepSeek, an increasing number of people are beginning to realize that the underlying chain-of-thought hidden behind large models is the core content worth paying more attention to. Previously, we could only see the results output by the model, but now we need to understand its logic, algorithms, and how to optimize the model&amp;rsquo;s performance by adjusting these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in thinking is actually a deep reflection on AI research and application. From simple black-box operations to truly understanding the internal workings of models, many technical personnel and investors have begun to re-examine the future development direction of artificial intelligence. The popularity of DeepSeek perfectly demonstrates this breakthrough application of the chain-of-thought, it encourages people to focus not only on the final output results but also on the entire model construction and optimization process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sudden surge in popularity of DeepSeek, NVIDIA‚Äôs stock plummet, and the subsequent short-selling activities by institutions ‚Äì it all seems like a meticulously designed scheme. Through an in-depth understanding of large model chain-of-thought reasoning, we can see that the application of AI technology is not merely superficial layering of phenomena, but also deep digging and optimization of the model‚Äôs internal logic. As the technology progresses, we may see more innovative tools like DeepSeek in the future, driving AI research and applications to a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon not only shows us the immense potential of AI technology, but also prompts us to start thinking about the commercial games and capital operations behind the technology. The future market trend will continue to be the focus of the battle between technology and capital.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Modern Monetary Theory the future of global economies?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/modern-monetary-theory-future-global-economy/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 23:16:34 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/modern-monetary-theory-future-global-economy/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The U.S. stock market‚Äôs sustained bull run is largely driven by the ‚Äúwatering‚Äù of the dollar, rather than America‚Äôs inherent ‚Äúhard power.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The modern monetary system has gradually become an important theoretical cornerstone for many economies worldwide since the 2008 financial crisis, emphasizing the subjective initiative of large governments in intervening in markets and utilizing government fiscal deficits as a primary tool to achieve full employment while stabilizing inflation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;large government&amp;rdquo; is most commonly associated with Keynesianism, which highlights the government‚Äôs role in ‚Äúsmoothing peaks and troughs‚Äù during economic cycles ‚Äì for example, suppressing overheating and stimulating contraction. It places great emphasis on the multiplier effect of government spending, i.e., how much an increase in monetary stimulus can amplify consumer multipliers; a 1-unit increase in government expenditure stimulates an equivalent increase in corporate and individual income, leading to business expansion and job creation, and ultimately mitigating economic downturns.  Furthermore, it adopts a relatively conservative approach to fiscal deficit limits and sustainability. The multiplier effect will drive market recovery, thereby increasing government revenue, especially during periods of overheating, where government debt potential and interest rate levels can be accumulated as stimulus funds for the next cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The modern monetary system is more like an extreme extension of Keynesianism, but with differences; its biggest characteristic is the limitation on government debt, which means the central bank should not have independent autonomy, primarily focused on inflation and full employment.  With limited resources and productivity, inflation refers to the government continuously increasing purchasing power through unlimited fiscal deficits as technological progress improves production efficiency, until it reaches the ideal level of full employment and production bottlenecks; continuing to increase monetary supply will lead to inflation, at which point it chooses to set a limit on fiscal deficits, as long as there are idle production resources, increased debt will not trigger inflation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-financial-crisis&#34;&gt;After the Financial Crisis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, reality is not an ideal world, and execution in each stage involves human participation. Keynesianism is also selectively applied, leading to more economic stimulus during downturns and less overheating suppression. Economic imbalances generate achievements, while overheating also does, making it extremely difficult to suppress them. The numerous economic problems brought about, even a new financial crisis, are not inferior to the economic shocks caused by traditional overcapacity. The 2008 global financial crisis was actually a market self-reinforcement resulting from extreme Keynesianism, leading to the proliferation of speculative structural financial investment products such as real estate and financial investment products derived from real estate as their underlying assets. Even before the crisis erupted, there was a lack of risk awareness at academic, political, and market levels, treating debt-fueled prosperity as achievements, and more people benefited from it, such as the enormous financial system: losses are yours, dividends are ours, it‚Äôs bankruptcy ‚Äì we made a fortune, money cannot be spat out. Ultimately, this led to massive investment by participants, bearing the profits of previous stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, the shadow of the modern monetary system entered the financial crisis, characterized by rapid monetization of fiscal deficits and central banks&amp;rsquo; unlimited quantitative easing, as well as so-called emergency central bank lending policies. As the final lender, the central bank supplied bullets endlessly, allowing governments to continue borrowing debt. The central bank coordinated with fiscal policy, supporting government fiscal deficit spending through methods such as purchasing bonds, ensuring consistency of policy objectives. This is also why the boundaries between modern monetary and fiscal policies are becoming increasingly blurred ‚Äì the base money injection relies heavily on the central bank‚Äôs direct participation in bond purchases, with one hand printing money and the other buying bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eurozone and the United States exhibited similar trends. In 2008, the EU government debt was approximately ‚Ç¨6.7 trillion, and the government leverage ratio was around 66%, slightly above the generally recognized warning line of 60%. By 2014 ‚Äì the five years of saving the market ‚Äì the debt scale reached ‚Ç¨9.5 trillion, and the leverage rose to 93%. The United States was even more exaggerated: in 2008, US government debt was approximately $10 trillion, reaching about $18 trillion by 2014, and recently again raising the government debt ceiling. Of course, each farce is staged with a government shutdown, but it will always break through the government debt limit. Currently exceeding $36 trillion, compared to $26 trillion growth in 2008, considering GDP growth factors, the government leverage has grown from 60% to over 120%. The Federal Reserve, as the final lender, played an important role in multiple rescue operations and is one of the main purchasers of government debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flaws-and-limitations-of-the-modern-monetary-system&#34;&gt;Flaws and Limitations of the Modern Monetary System
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This government-led stimulus scheme, though not a planned economy, faces consistent problems. How can you guarantee the market‚Äôs omniscience and all participants‚Äô selfless dedication at every stage? Let&amp;rsquo;s take a simple example: if a government department increases its budget for a particular direction by 1 million, is it going to go to the mayor‚Äôs nephew or a more cost-effective market auction? Of course, in reality, interests will form in increasingly complex ways, leading to the result that even though the government has expanded debt and spending, it flows completely out of control. The recent American establishment of a Government Accountability Office is an extension of this type of problem. These issues manifest differently across varying corrupt economies; we‚Äôre focusing on discussing the more prevalent problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-inflation-issues&#34;&gt;1. Inflation Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the development of the modern information network, governments have a much greater grasp on market information than in the past, but this is not omniscience; markets inherently contain variables and are always subject to change based on expectations, leading to nested loops (or ‚ÄúRussian dolls‚Äù). I anticipate your predictions. Taking actual performance as an example, while between 2008 and 2020, the practice of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) performed well, achieving short-term economic recovery and inflation stabilization ‚Äì even the Eurozone experienced phase-wise deflation, and U.S. inflation remained roughly within the expected 1-3% range, leading people to believe in extreme tools like Keynesianism again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we look back, it was primarily due to continued high growth in manufacturing in developing countries after 2008, such as our country gradually securing its position as a global production base and Southeast Asian and Indian economies following suit, all maintaining relatively high industrial value added, which offset the biggest limitation of MMT ‚Äì resource supply constraints. Even under de-industrialization and excessive financialization in Europe and America, they simultaneously experienced increased government debt and monetary supply surges, while maintaining relatively stable inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after 2020, with the use of larger-scale stimulus policies, both the Eurozone and the United States saw more significant inflation, peaking at around 10% ‚Äì even today, despite rising interest rates for nearly three years, the U.S. labor market continues to exhibit abnormal overheating, and financial markets experience divergence from economic growth supported by monetary support, with inflation running towards 3% as the base effect disappears. This overheating performance during rate hikes is closely related to fiscal deficits. Raising interest rates is a contractionary monetary policy, while fiscal policy remains expansionary, compounded by the ultra-massive money injection in 2020, which has made U.S. inflation remarkably persistent. The biggest limitation of MMT is high inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-government-debt-issues&#34;&gt;2. Government Debt Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In principle, governments can indefinitely finance debt repayment through borrowing, but this is only possible if &lt;strong&gt;the central bank becomes a complete puppet&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning full alignment of monetary and fiscal policy ‚Äì a key element of modern monetary systems known as &lt;strong&gt;policy coherence&lt;/strong&gt;. The Federal Reserve has no intention of granting the government completely unfettered authority, especially considering the accumulated government debt balance over many years, particularly interest expenses, which are increasingly becoming a significant burden on finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal Year 2023: In fiscal year 2023, the United States generated $4.439 trillion in revenue. The proportion of interest payments on its debt to this revenue was approximately 15%.  In 2024, this high-interest environment continued, according to data released by the U.S. Treasury Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal Year 2024: The U.S. federal government‚Äôs budget deficit reached $1.833 trillion, with net interest payments on debt totaling $882 billion ‚Äì approximately 18% of U.S. revenue. This even exceeded Social Security expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This highlights the sustainability issues within fiscal policy. If persistently maintained at low interest rates and low inflation, high levels of debt (such as in Japan) could theoretically lead to a slow, incremental increase under a quasi-modern monetary system.  According to the 72 rule, if interest costs are sufficiently low, debt repayment can double over 72 years ‚Äì assuming inflation breaks this delicate balance, the accumulation of interest payments on debt will lead to runaway debt levels, with principal becoming a secondary factor. If the central bank subsequently diverges from the government‚Äôs objectives, these issues will become even more acute.  Furthermore, Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s political agenda starkly contrasted with the current Federal Reserve&amp;rsquo;s hawkish stance, contributing significantly to tensions between the U.S. government and the Fed during his term. The primary focus of observers is whether the current chairman can successfully complete his term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-financial-bubbles-and-monetary-credit-issues&#34;&gt;3. Financial Bubbles and Monetary Credit Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, government-expanded spending enters the household and corporate sectors, leading everyone to expand their spending, thereby boosting the increase in effective demand. However, given that people are all experienced from numerous financial bubbles since 2000, it‚Äôs clear that investment and consumption choices will exhibit a strong tendency towards large investment appreciation, especially when one or more products with extremely high expected appreciation appear, people will flock to the financial market seeking higher appreciation, even willing to compress living standards and leverage up. This is similar to what happened in Japan, the United States, and China during periods of high real estate growth. Combined with policy stimulus and the pursuit of maximum self-interest by practitioners, issues such as subprime loans are rampant. Many so-called bailout policies are actually encouraging borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, historical performance shows an astonishing consistency: when monetary and fiscal policies are deployed on a large scale, it often leads to &lt;strong&gt;asset bubbles and wealth redistribution frenzies&lt;/strong&gt;. The asset bubble comes first, followed by wealth redistribution. This results in another problem ‚Äì the extreme Keynesianism or Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) frequently encountered ‚Äì leading to economic Ponzi schemes (Minsky Moment). As long as there is hot money, asset prices continue to rise; as long as they keep rising, latercomers will flock to hold cash; while the CPI measuring changes in basic living expenses doesn&amp;rsquo;t change significantly, money circulates within specific areas, and latercomers have no way out. &lt;strong&gt;After the frenzy comes the collapse&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the judgment of the Minsky Moment ‚Äì repeatedly proven effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, currency itself has a supply and demand relationship. When market supply exceeds demand, traditional investment products cannot accommodate it, or when it harvests too much capital that cannot attract investment, such as repeated real estate bubbles (Japanese people haven&amp;rsquo;t dared to touch real estate investments for decades), tax policies like increasing property holding taxes to reduce speculative demand will increase the cost of financial speculation. In a situation of excessive monetary supply, the market urgently needs investment-and-tax-exempt investment products, and various virtual investment products emerge accordingly, even including the US President and First Lady joining in. One saying is to dig into the dollar, but it‚Äôs actually the inevitable result of global currency issuance and financial circulation under the damage of fiat currency credit. MMT relies most on countries with monopoly rights over credit money, which are also challenged. What kind of soil breeds what kind of financial game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) and Keynesianism are more like a progression and replacement relationship, emphasizing greater government intervention in the market and adopting a more aggressive attitude towards fiscal deficits and central bank independence. Excessive use of Keynesianism leads to stagflation and financial crises; MMT quietly took over after 2008 to clear out this artificially overheated economy. Under global economic globalization, productivity continues to improve, it quickly restored growth in the short term while maintaining inflation levels in the country using it, but also accumulated large government debt and asset bubbles. When inflation rebounded, with inconsistent goals between the central bank and the government, high interest rates and high leverage coexist, further exacerbating the fiscal burden brought about by government bond issuance. Fiscal sustainability is significantly weakened. Furthermore, excessive government participation has led to monetary base expansion, creating asset bubbles, while unlimited printing of money weakens the creditworthiness of the currency itself. It may appear that the dollar is strong, but it‚Äôs just a reflection of others. The massive investment demand creates fertile ground for various new types of financial investment and speculative tools, even escaping tax restrictions on traditional financial investment products ‚Äì this is a microcosm of the global economy. MMT may not be the future, but it&amp;rsquo;s more like the past used after 2008, superimposed on the decline of economic globalization, the larger the financial bubble blown by governments, the higher the accumulated government debt, and the more frantic the financial speculative tools, the higher the efficiency of distorting wealth allocation. The greater the risk of a hard landing ‚Äì including economic and social risks. Whether it‚Äôs Keynesianism or MMT, no matter how much monetary supply is provided, it cannot truly solve the problem of wealth structure; instead, it exacerbates risks in asset bubbles and Ponzi schemes. People are repeatedly falling into the same pit in different postures, but never learn anything from it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mastering atop: A Comprehensive Guide to Monitoring Linux System Metrics ‚Äì Installation, Configuration, and Usage</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/atop-linux-system-monitoring-guide/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 22:48:55 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/atop-linux-system-monitoring-guide/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Linux system administration, real-time and comprehensive monitoring of system resources and process status is crucial. The atop tool, as a powerful monitoring powerhouse, helps us easily achieve this goal. This article will provide a detailed introduction on how to install, configure, and use the atop monitoring tool in a Linux instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-atop-tool-introduction&#34;&gt;I. atop Tool Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;atop is a tool specifically designed for monitoring Linux system resources and processes. It records the activity of systems and processes, and reports on the running status of all processes. The data collected by this tool covers resource usage such as CPU, memory, disk, and network, as well as process states. It can also save the data in log files to disk. For each process, we can obtain key information such as CPU utilization, memory growth, disk usage, priority, username, status, and exit code. Furthermore, through the atop configuration file, we can customize parameters such as logging collection frequency, log file storage path, and rotation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-installing-the-atop-tool&#34;&gt;II. Installing the atop Tool
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The installation method for atop varies slightly depending on the Linux distribution. The following provides an introduction based on common operating systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba Cloud Linux 3/2, CentOS 7/8, Fedora, Rocky Linux 9:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the installation command: &lt;code&gt;sudo yum install -y atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the atop service: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu / Debian:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the software source list: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the installation command: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install -y atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the atop service: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CentOS Stream 9:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install: &lt;code&gt;sudo wget https://www.atoptool.nl/download/atop-2.11.0-1.el9.x86_64.rpm &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo rpm -i atop-2.11.0-1.el9.x86_64.rpm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the atop service: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;openSUSE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the installation command: &lt;code&gt;sudo zypper install -y atop atop-daemon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the atop service: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration File Location:&lt;/strong&gt; In Alibaba Cloud Linux 3/2, CentOS 7/8, and Fedora systems, the atop configuration file is &lt;code&gt;/etc/sysconfig/atop&lt;/code&gt;; in Ubuntu, Debian, and openSUSE systems, the configuration file is &lt;code&gt;/etc/default/atop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Default Configuration Parameter Explanation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOGOPTS&lt;/code&gt;: Controls logging options for log files, defaults to empty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOGINTERVAL&lt;/code&gt;: Monitoring cycle, default 600 seconds. To collect historical logs for tracking issues, it‚Äôs recommended to adjust this frequency based on actual needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOGGENERATIONS&lt;/code&gt;: Log retention time, default 28 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOGPATH&lt;/code&gt;: Log file storage path, defaults to &lt;code&gt;/var/log/atop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration Steps&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the command to open the configuration file:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Alibaba Cloud Linux 3/2, CentOS 7/8, and Fedora systems: &lt;code&gt;sudo vim /etc/sysconfig/atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, CentOS Stream 9, and Rocky Linux 9 systems: &lt;code&gt;sudo vim /etc/default/atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press ‚Äòi‚Äô to enter edit mode, adjust the configuration parameters according to your needs. For example, to change the monitoring cycle to 30 seconds, set the log retention time to 7 days, and maintain the default log path:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press ‚ÄòEsc‚Äô key, input &lt;code&gt;:wq&lt;/code&gt;, save and exit editing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart the atop service to make the configuration effective: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl restart atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;LOGOPTS=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;: Sort processes in descending order by overall resource usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;: Sort processes in descending order by network usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;: Jump to the next monitoring collection point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;: Jump to the previous monitoring collection point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;: Specify a time point in the format &lt;code&gt;YYYYMMDDhhmm&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Monitoring Field Meaning Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATOP&lt;/strong&gt;: Hostname, information sampling date and timepoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRC&lt;/strong&gt;: Overall process running status, including kernel mode and user mode runtime, total number of processes, number of processes in different states, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CPU&lt;/strong&gt;: Overall CPU usage, the sum of the numbers in each field is &lt;code&gt;N*100%&lt;/code&gt; (N is the number of CPU cores), which includes the proportion of time for kernel mode, user mode, interrupts, idle, and waiting for disk IO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CPL&lt;/strong&gt;: CPU load situation, such as the average number of processes in the queue over 1 minute, 5 minutes and 15 minutes, the number of context switches, and the number of interrupts that occur.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NET&lt;/strong&gt;: Network status, displays the TCP and UDP transmission layer, IP layer, and the receiving and sending packet sizes of each active port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View Real-time System Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View system metrics every 5 seconds: &lt;code&gt;atop 5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View system metrics for the past 5 minutes (30 times in total, interval 10 seconds): &lt;code&gt;atop -M 10 30&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View system metrics for the past 10 minutes (10 times, interval 60 seconds) and write the results to a file: &lt;code&gt;atop -M 60 10 &amp;gt; /log/atop.mem&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View Historical Metric Logs&lt;/strong&gt;: After atop is started, recording data is stored by default in the &lt;code&gt;/var/log/atop&lt;/code&gt; directory. When viewing, be sure to specify the date of the log file must exist, otherwise it will error.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View daily historical metric logs: &lt;code&gt;atop -r&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View yesterday&amp;rsquo;s historical metric logs: &lt;code&gt;atop -r y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View historical metric logs for a specific date, such as 2024/11/06: &lt;code&gt;atop -r 20241106&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View historical metric logs from a specific time on a specific date, such as starting from 14:00 on 2024/11/06: &lt;code&gt;atop -r 20241106 -b 14:00&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View historical metric logs for a specific time period on a specific date, such as from 00:04 to 00:08 on 2024/11/5: &lt;code&gt;atop -r 20241105 -b 00:04 -e 00:08&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View System Activity Report&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View the CPU utilization report for the current system in 1 minute (12 times, interval 5 seconds): &lt;code&gt;atopsar -c 5 12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View the memory metric report for a specific time period on a given day, such as from 18:00 to 18:01: &lt;code&gt;atopsar -m -b 18:00 -e 18:01&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View the memory metric report for a specific date and time period, such as from 18:00 to 18:01 on 2024/11/5: `atopsar -&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;five-other-operations&#34;&gt;Five. Other Operations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configure Daily Log Rotation Policy&lt;/strong&gt;: If you want to generate an atop metric log file daily, perform the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) Adjust monitoring period, log retention time, and log storage path according to your needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the command to enable and start the services related to daily log rotation: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl enable --now atop atopacct atop-rotate.timer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your business has more complex requirements for log processing, you can also combine it with logrotate or custom scripts to implement log management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Optional netatop Kernel Module&lt;/strong&gt;: If you need to monitor network usage, you can install the netatop module (this module is not installed by default in atop).  For example, on Alibaba Cloud Linux 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the kernel development package and the software environment required for compiling: &lt;code&gt;sudo yum install -y kernel-devel dkms elfutils-libelf-devel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the latest version of netatop source code to a specified directory: &lt;code&gt;cd /usr/src/ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo wget https://www.atoptool.nl/download/netatop-3.2.2.tar.gz --no-check-certificate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract the source code and enter the source code directory: &lt;code&gt;sudo tar -zxvf netatop-3.2.2.tar.gz &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd netatop-3.2.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and install the module and daemon based on the source code: &lt;code&gt;sudo make &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo make install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the netatop service: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start netatop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;atop tool is powerful and flexible, and by installing, configuring, and using it properly, we can better understand the running status of the Linux system and promptly identify and solve potential problems. We hope this article will help everyone take Linux system monitoring to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding ‚Äúbuy rate‚Äù and ‚Äúsell rate‚Äù in exchange rates</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-buy-and-sell-exchange-rates/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 22:32:10 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-buy-and-sell-exchange-rates/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the foreign exchange market, particularly at banks or currency exchange points, we often see terms like ‚Äúbuy rate‚Äù and ‚Äúsell rate.‚Äù Many people may not be clear about these concepts, or even confuse them. Today, let‚Äôs help everyone understand the meaning of these rates and their functions through a simple example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-what-are-buy-rate-and-sell-rate&#34;&gt;1. What are ‚ÄúBuy Rate‚Äù and ‚ÄúSell Rate‚Äù?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The bank or currency exchange institution is willing to purchase foreign currencies at this rate, meaning when you sell your foreign currency (such as US dollars) to the bank, the bank will pay you RMB according to the buy rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The bank or currency exchange institution is willing to sell foreign currencies at this rate, meaning when you buy foreign currency with RMB, the bank will sell you the foreign currency at the sell rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The price at which the bank buys foreign currency from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The price at which the bank sells foreign currency to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the buy and sell rates of banks are usually different, and the sell rate is generally higher than the buy rate. This difference is the source of profit for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-specific-case-analysis&#34;&gt;2. Specific Case Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help everyone better understand the practical application of these exchange rates, let‚Äôs look at a specific example:
Assume you go to a bank to exchange dollars, and the bank provides the following exchange rate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 US Dollar = 7.0 RMB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 US Dollar = 7.2 RMB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-1-you-sell-us-dollars-to-a-bank&#34;&gt;Scenario 1: You Sell US Dollars to a Bank
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs assume you have $1,000 USD and want to sell these dollars to a bank. The bank will calculate the transaction using the buying rate:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
1000 \, \text{USD} \times 7.0 \, \text{CNY/USD} = 7000 \, \text{CNY}
\]
&lt;p&gt;This means the bank will give you 7,000 CNY. The exchange rate is the &lt;strong&gt;buying rate&lt;/strong&gt; because you are selling USD to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-two-you-buy-us-dollars-with-renminbi&#34;&gt;Scenario Two: You Buy US Dollars with Renminbi
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assume you have 7,000 RMB and want to exchange it for US dollars. The bank will calculate the amount in USD based on the selling rate:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
7000 \, \text{RMB} \div 7.2 \, \text{RMB/USD} = 972.22 \, \text{USD}
\]
&lt;p&gt;In this case, you can exchange 7,000 RMB for approximately 972.22 USD. The exchange rate here is the &lt;strong&gt;selling rate&lt;/strong&gt;, because you are purchasing US dollars from the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-why-buying-and-selling-currency-differ&#34;&gt;3. Why Buying and Selling Currency Differ?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that a bank‚Äôs buying rate (7.0 RMB/USD) is lower than its selling rate (7.2 RMB/USD). This is because banks typically profit from this exchange rate spread when engaging in foreign exchange transactions. In other words, banks earn profits by charging a higher selling rate and paying a lower buying rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the above case, the bank‚Äôs spread is:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
\text{Selling Rate} (7.2) - \text{Buying Rate} (7.0) = 0.2 \, RMB
\]
&lt;p&gt;This difference in price is the source of the bank&amp;rsquo;s profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-summary&#34;&gt;4. Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The bank buys foreign currency from you at this rate (the same rate you sold the foreign currency for).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selling Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The bank sells foreign currency to you at this rate (the same rate you bought the foreign currency for).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exchange Rate Difference:&lt;/strong&gt; The difference between the buying and selling rates is the bank‚Äôs profit margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these two rate concepts allows us to clearly know how much foreign currency we will receive, or how much Renminbi we need to spend to buy foreign currency when conducting foreign exchange. We hope this simple example helps everyone better understand the basic principles of foreign exchange rates!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visual Studio loading a mismatched PDB file</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-load-unmatched-pdb/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 20:04:33 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-load-unmatched-pdb/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When debugging programs under Windows using Visual Studio, if the PDB file does not match the executable file, Visual Studio will display &amp;ldquo;Unable to load symbol file.&amp;rdquo; The program crashes and generates a crash dump. If it&amp;rsquo;s an mismatched PDB file, Visual Studio cannot smoothly enter the crash site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-pdb-file&#34;&gt;What is a PDB File?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PDB file is a debugging information file created by Microsoft, used for debugging programs. It contains information such as the symbol table, source code filenames, line numbers, and other debugging data. A PDB file can be generated during program compilation to aid in debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;windbg-debugging&#34;&gt;WinDbg Debugging
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WinDbg is a debugging tool from Microsoft that can be used to debug Windows programs. WinDbg can load mismatched PDB files, but this requires manual loading. The &lt;code&gt;.reload /f /i&lt;/code&gt; command forces the loading of mismatched PDB files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, WinDbg is less convenient to use than Visual Studio, so we want Visual Studio to also be able to load mismatched PDB files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio-cannot-load-matching-pdb-files&#34;&gt;Visual Studio Cannot Load Matching PDB Files
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source code is now generally managed through Git, allowing you to find the corresponding version of the code and recompile it to generate matching PDB files. Why can‚Äôt they be loaded? The main reason is that metadata doesn&amp;rsquo;t match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a small tool that can modify metadata, generating a new PDB file based on the EXE file information so that Visual Studio can load it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChkMatch download address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.debuginfo.com/tools/chkmatch.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;The ChkMatch utility can be used to check whether an executable and debug information file match. It can also be used to enforce matching between an executable and a debug information file if they are compatible.

For more information about debug information matching and related issues, see this article.

Supported debug information formats: DBG, PDB 2.0, PDB 7.0.

chkmatch [-c ExeFile DebugInfoFile ] |
         [-m ExeFile DebugInfoFile]
-c
Check matching between the executable and the debug information file.
-m
Make the executable and the debug information file match.
ExeFile
The name of the executable file.
DebugInfoFile
The name of the debug information file.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-chkmatch&#34;&gt;Using chkmatch
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, perform the check operation to analyze the cause of mismatches and prompt signature mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cursor AI Programming IDE Trial</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like another year has passed, and the biggest change at work is a significant increase in AI participation. Previously, switching between different development languages required developers to be familiar with various language-specific API interfaces. Now, these basic code snippets can all be generated by AI, which is a huge blessing for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chatgpt&#34;&gt;ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As early as 2023, I‚Äôve written two simple introductory articles about it. Now it&amp;rsquo;s been 25 years ‚Äì how to put this‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt felt a significant improvement. It still needs to develop its own cognition, be able to reasonably break down tasks, and, of course, most importantly, identify whether AI-generated code contains bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-copilot&#34;&gt;Github Copilot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a long time ago, but I saw some information saying that Singapore deployed the server and it‚Äôs available for use in China. No longer need to maintain a VPN connection for extended periods. Of course, when logging in, you still need to connect to a VPN, but this VPN only needs to be used during login, and then you can turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In daily use, Github Copilot is also heavily relied upon. This plugin can be directly used in VS Code and Visual Studio without switching between the two applications. Compared to ChatGPT, Github Copilot provides better support for projects, is more user-friendly in interaction, and allows you to feed partial local files to it ‚Äì &lt;strong&gt;‚Äútraining‚Äù the AI&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì so that the generated code is more aligned with your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cursor-ai&#34;&gt;Cursor AI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I‚Äôve seen a new AI programming IDE, Cursor AI. This IDE is based on Github Copilot, but this IDE is more intelligent and can help you create files directly.
I tried it briefly and found it to be pretty good, but its understanding of existing projects isn&amp;rsquo;t quite there yet. When working with large local project files, or for major refactoring, optimization, and adjustments, developers still need to &lt;strong&gt;break down tasks&lt;/strong&gt;.
Here‚Äôs an example: Switching to Cursor‚Äôs engineering mode, inputting the following content: ‚ÄúCreate a personal resume webpage, supporting multiple different styles switching, and remember to fill in some personal information for data display.‚Äù
After several back-and-forths (&lt;strong&gt;pulling&lt;/strong&gt;), you can get the following webpage. Of course, this webpage is relatively simple, but it‚Äôs still pretty good for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, registered users can enjoy a free trial of 150 advanced APIs, while paying users are limited to 5000 advanced APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cursor-ai-1&#34;&gt;Cursor AI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/cursor/index.html&#34; &gt;Resume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>C&#43;&#43; Bitwise Operations Fundamentals: Bitwise Extraction and Flag Setting</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-bitwise-operations-flags/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 02:23:56 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-bitwise-operations-flags/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In actual C++ development, bitwise operations are a common technique, especially when dealing with system states, flags, or control bits. Bitwise operations can provide very efficient solutions. This article will illustrate how to use bitwise operations to retrieve and set specific flags through an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bitwise-operations-fundamentals&#34;&gt;Bitwise Operations Fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In computers, data is stored in binary bits (0 and 1). Bitwise operations are operations performed on these binary bits. C++ provides several commonly used bitwise operators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise AND (&amp;amp;)&lt;/strong&gt;: Used to check if a particular bit is set to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise OR (|)&lt;/strong&gt;: Used to set a particular bit to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise XOR (^)&lt;/strong&gt;: Used to flip a particular bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise NOT (~)&lt;/strong&gt;: Inverts all the bits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left Shift (&amp;laquo;)&lt;/strong&gt;: Shifts all bits to the left by a specified number of positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right Shift (&amp;raquo;)&lt;/strong&gt;: Shifts all bits to the right by a specified number of positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we need to perform a series of bitwise operations on an &lt;code&gt;unsigned short&lt;/code&gt; variable &lt;code&gt;wInfo&lt;/code&gt; to represent different states using various flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mermaid&#34;&gt;flowchart LR
    A[Original Value: 00010000] --&amp;gt; B[Left Shift: 00010000 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1]
    B --&amp;gt; C[Result: 00100000]
    C --&amp;gt; D[Right Shift: 00100000 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1]
    D --&amp;gt; E[Result: 00010000]

    subgraph Left Shift Operation
        direction LR
        A --&amp;gt; B --&amp;gt; C
    end

    subgraph Right Shift Operation
        direction LR
        C --&amp;gt; D --&amp;gt; E
    end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirement-analysis&#34;&gt;Requirement Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the description, we have a 16-bit flag to represent different states. These states are represented by various binary bits, with each binary bit corresponding to a specific meaning. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit0&lt;/strong&gt;: Failure status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit1&lt;/strong&gt;: Compression status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit2&lt;/strong&gt;: Incremental status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit3&lt;/strong&gt;: Presence of subsequent packets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit5&lt;/strong&gt;: Normal request or cancellation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-bitwise-operations&#34;&gt;Using Bitwise Operations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will use bitwise operations to set and retrieve these flags. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise AND:&lt;/strong&gt; Retrieve the value of a particular bit (0 or 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise OR:&lt;/strong&gt; Set a particular bit to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise XOR:&lt;/strong&gt; Set a particular bit to 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first define an &lt;code&gt;unsigned short&lt;/code&gt; type variable &lt;code&gt;wInfo&lt;/code&gt; to store these flags. Then, we use bitwise operations to check and set the corresponding flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;c-example-code&#34;&gt;C++ Example Code
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;bitset&amp;gt;

// Define flag constants
const unsigned short BIT_0_FAIL = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0;    // bit0 failed?
const unsigned short BIT_1_COMPRESSED = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1; // bit1 compressed?
const unsigned short BIT_2_INCREMENT = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2;  // bit2 incremented?
const unsigned short BIT_3_HAS_MORE = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 3;   // bit3 has more packets?
const unsigned short BIT_5_CANCEL = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 5;     // bit5 normal request(0) or cancel(1)

// Check if a bit is set
bool isBitSet(unsigned short wInfo, unsigned short bitMask) {
    return (wInfo &amp;amp; bitMask) != 0;
}

// Set a bit to 1
void setBit(unsigned short&amp;amp; wInfo, unsigned short bitMask) {
    wInfo |= bitMask;
}

// Clear a bit (set it to 0)
void clearBit(unsigned short&amp;amp; wInfo, unsigned short bitMask) {
    wInfo &amp;amp;= ~bitMask;
}

int main() {
    // Assume wInfo&#39;s initial value is 0
    unsigned short wInfo = 0;

    // Set bit0 (failure flag)
    setBit(wInfo, BIT_0_FAIL);
    
    // Set bit1 (compressed flag)
    setBit(wInfo, BIT_1_COMPRESSED);
    
    // Print wInfo&#39;s binary value
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;wInfo (in binary): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::bitset&amp;lt;16&amp;gt;(wInfo) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

    // Check each flag
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit0 (failed?): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_0_FAIL) ? &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit1 (compressed?): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_1_COMPRESSED) ? &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit2 (incremented?): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_2_INCREMENT) ? &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit3 (has more packets?): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_3_HAS_MORE) ? &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit5 (canceled?): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_5_CANCEL) ? &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

    // Clear bit1 (compressed flag)
    clearBit(wInfo, BIT_1_COMPRESSED);
    
    // Print the updated wInfo
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Updated wInfo (in binary): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::bitset&amp;lt;16&amp;gt;(wInfo) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the code, recommended for old friends: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wandbox.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://wandbox.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;wInfo (in binary): 0000000000000001
bit0 (failed?): yes
bit1 (compressed?): no
bit2 (incremented?): no
bit3 (has more packets?): no
bit5 (canceled?): no
Updated wInfo (in binary): 0000000000000000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;code-explanation&#34;&gt;Code Explanation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flag Definition&lt;/strong&gt;: Use shift operations (&lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; n&lt;/code&gt;) to define each flag bit. For example, &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to &lt;code&gt;bit0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to &lt;code&gt;bit1&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. This way, we allocate a unique binary position for each flag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check a Bit&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;isBitSet&lt;/code&gt; function uses the bitwise AND operation (&lt;code&gt;wInfo &amp;amp; bitMask&lt;/code&gt;) to check if a specific flag is set to 1. If the bit is 1, the function returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise it returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a Bit&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;setBit&lt;/code&gt; function uses the bitwise OR operation (&lt;code&gt;wInfo |= bitMask&lt;/code&gt;) to set a specific flag bit to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear a Bit&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;clearBit&lt;/code&gt; function uses the bitwise AND operation (&lt;code&gt;wInfo &amp;amp;= ~bitMask&lt;/code&gt;) to clear a specific flag bit to 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through bitwise operations, we can efficiently handle multiple state flags. This technique is particularly useful in practical development. For example, in embedded development, network protocols, and system status management scenarios, bit flags are often used to represent multiple binary states, saving space and improving efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this blog post helps you understand how to use bitwise operations in C++ to perform bitwise selection and setting, and mastering these skills is very helpful for writing efficient and maintainable code!&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:37:52 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/desktop-upgrade-to-2-5g-network-card-accelerates-local-area-network-interconnection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Desktop hardware three-in-one, in the previous text we mentioned PCIe adapter for solid state drives, where did the old SSDs go? Of course there was no waste, were any of them broken, disassembled and installed on the newly purchased ‚ÄòMechMaker Mini-3765H‚Äô (bought a year ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new machine has powerful hardware specifications: 2.5G dual network interface, PCIe4.0, WiFi6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently moved house and my room doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a dedicated router for networking, all the machines are connected via wireless network; the ASUS motherboard desktop wireless card performance wasn‚Äôt great, or perhaps it was the router‚Äôs wireless access, which resulted in slow upload speeds between local networks, leading to poor network speeds between the machines. I purchased a 2.5G NIC and installed it on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus, all the slots on the motherboard are now full: graphics card, wireless card, 2.5G NIC, PCIe adapter for solid state drives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;network-instructions&#34;&gt;Network Instructions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both machines connect to the internet using their original wireless network cards, but are directly connected via Ethernet cables between the two, with both ends equipped with 2.5G network cards.  The specifics of how to physically connect the cables aren&amp;rsquo;t detailed here ‚Äì numerous tutorials are available online; just remember to disable your firewall. You can select either machine as the gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mermaid&#34;&gt;graph TD;
    A[Machine 1&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;IP: 192.168.4.1&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Default Gateway: - &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Obtain DNS Automatically] --&amp;gt;|Ethernet Connection (2.5G)| B[Machine 2&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;IP: 192.168.4.2&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Default Gateway: 192.168.4.1&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Obtain DNS Automatically];

        <title>ASUS Z490 motherboard has too many disks, resulting in intermittent disk unrecognition.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/asus-z490-motherboard-disk-recognition-issues/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:08:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/asus-z490-motherboard-disk-recognition-issues/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the previous text, an issue suddenly arose where the wireless network card was unable to be recognized. Before rebuilding the partitions, I had also researched other solutions online, such as: removing the motherboard battery and disconnecting power for fifteen minutes; upgrading to the latest version of the BOIS driver, but all attempts were unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking there were still tasks to complete, I switched to a limited network by pulling a web across from the living room into the room. However, this is when the problem returned ‚Äì wired networking was also unable to be recognized. I then resorted to the ultimate solution of reinstalling the system, which resulted in partition loss during the boot process. If the issue had consistently occurred, I wouldn‚Äôt have spent so long troubleshooting it; the ASUS disk conflict is intermittent and triggered by unstable system restarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I purchased a new 2TB solid-state drive fromÈïøÊ±üÂ≠òÂÇ® (Jiangang Chengsu ‚Äì Yangtze Storage) with an M.2 interface, and the machine never rebooted until yesterday when I shut it down once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reinstalling-the-system&#34;&gt;Reinstalling the System
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been almost two years since I last reinstalled the system, and my C drive is completely full. Windows keeps throwing old issues, and various software likes to store things on C: Drive. So, I decided to reinstall the system. After reinstalling the system, the network card issue was resolved, and I restored my daily development environment the next day. While preparing to create a system backup, a new problem arose: after restarting the system, the boot partition disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the steps in the previous article, I rebuilt the boot partition; however, it wasn‚Äôt stable, and the partition would frequently fail to load upon restart. I started to wonder if the chassis was being tampered with when I realized that the hard drive cable was loose, but after several checks, there were no issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;memory-retrieval&#34;&gt;Memory Retrieval
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, this machine had once been equipped with a solid-state drive; it was like buying a new PCIE converter (plugged into the graphics card slot) instead of directly installing the hard drive onto the motherboard. This time, it‚Äôs installed directly on the motherboard, which may be due to an issue with the motherboard.

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motherboard manual has issues, with the labeled SATA port positions differing from the actual positions. Due to a large number of disks, all ports are populated with hard drives, with older SSDs utilizing SATA ports. According to the manual, there is a conflict between the ports. However, after testing, this conflict was found to be unstable and would trigger, causing the corresponding disk to fail to load ‚Äì specifically, as it‚Äôs the system disk, the bootloader is also located on that disk, resulting in boot loader failure during system startup.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Uncovering the Mysteries of ESP Partitions, GPT Partitions Table, and the Synergy with Windows Operating Systems</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/esp-partitioning-gpt-windows-cooperation/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday after finishing work, I followed the usual routine of booting up my desktop computer. The system started normally but couldn&amp;rsquo;t load the wireless network card. I thought it might be loose, so I disassembled the computer and reinstalled the wireless network card. That‚Äôs when things went really wrong ‚Äì the system simply wouldn‚Äôt start, and the bootloader failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a long time since I‚Äôd messed around with a desktop computer, and I was a little unfamiliar with partitioning and booting. Using DisGenius, I repartitioned a blank partition (usually partitioned to the beginning of the disk) and allocated it as an ESP partition (defaulting to 300M). I then entered PE system to rebuild the boot, and relevant information could be found online.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of computer storage, the ESP partition, GPT partition table, and Windows operating system are closely linked, each playing a unique and crucial role in supporting the stable operation and efficient management of the system. However, before delving into them, we must mention ‚ÄúÂâçËæà‚Äù ‚Äì MBR partition table format, which reflects with later technologies, highlighting the evolution of technology. Today, let‚Äôs delve into their internal connection and subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-mbr-partition-table--the-foundation-of-traditional-hard-disk-partitioning&#34;&gt;I. MBR Partition Table ‚Äì The ‚ÄúFoundation‚Äù of Traditional Hard Disk Partitioning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;MBR, which stands for Master Boot Record, has existed since the early days of personal computers and has dominated the hard disk partitioning landscape for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-basic-architecture&#34;&gt;1. Basic Architecture
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is located in the first sector of the hard disk, which is sector 0, occupying 512 bytes of space. These 512 bytes are primarily divided into three parts: firstly, the boot program code, responsible for loading the operating system&amp;rsquo;s boot loader during computer startup, typically 446 bytes; secondly, the disk partition table, occupying 64 bytes, which can define up to 4 main partitions, with each partition describing 16 bytes of information, recording the starting head, sector, and cylinder of the partition, as well as key parameters such as partition type and size; and finally, the last 2 bytes are the MBR end marker &amp;ldquo;55 AA&amp;rdquo;, used to identify this sector as a valid MBR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-historical-achievements-and-limitations&#34;&gt;2. Historical Achievements and Limitations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days, MBR partition tables fully met the storage needs of relatively simple personal computers. It allowed operating systems to seamlessly recognize hard disk partitions, enabling orderly data storage and retrieval. However, as times evolved, its limitations became increasingly apparent. Firstly, limited by a 64-byte partition table space, it could only define a maximum of 4 primary partitions; creating more partitions required the use of extended partitions and logical partitions ‚Äì methods that were somewhat complex and added to the difficulty of disk management. Secondly, its maximum support was only 2TB of hard drives, which seemed inadequate in the face of today‚Äôs large-capacity drives routinely measuring several TB or even tens of TB. This became a bottleneck hindering further development of storage technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-esp-partition--the-systems-invisible-boot-key&#34;&gt;II. ESP Partition ‚Äì The System‚Äôs ‚ÄúInvisible Boot Key‚Äù
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESP, which stands for EFI System Partition, is a special partition required by computers based on the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-functional-features&#34;&gt;1. Functional Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boot Loading:&lt;/strong&gt; When the computer starts up, UEFI firmware first searches for the ESP partition on the hard drive and reads the boot loader (such as Windows Boot Manager) stored within it, thereby launching the operating system. This is like a precise key that opens the door to system startup; without it, the system would be lost and confused during startup, not knowing where to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage Driver:&lt;/strong&gt; The ESP partition also stores some driver programs necessary for the system boot process, ensuring that hardware devices (such as hard disk controllers, graphics cards, etc.) function normally in the early stages of booting, laying a foundation for the smooth takeover of the operating system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-space-requirements-and-formatting&#34;&gt;2. Space Requirements and Formatting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, ESP partition sizes should range from 100MB to 500MB, with an allocation of around 200MB generally sufficient for basic needs. Its file system format must be FAT32, as UEFI firmware can only recognize FAT32 formatting to read boot files, ensuring compatibility and cross-platform support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-gpt-partition-table--the-hard-drives-smart-manager&#34;&gt;Three. GPT Partition Table ‚Äì The Hard Drive‚Äôs ‚ÄúSmart Manager‚Äù
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT (GUID Partition Table), also known as the Globally Unique Identifier Partition Table, is a new partitioning scheme designed to replace the traditional MBR partition table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-advantages-demonstrated&#34;&gt;1. Advantages Demonstrated
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Capacity Support:&lt;/strong&gt; In today‚Äôs era of data explosion, large-capacity hard drives are emerging one after another. GPT partition tables break the MBR&amp;rsquo;s 2TB capacity limit, theoretically enabling support for up to 9.4ZB (zettabytes ‚Äì 1ZB = 1024 EB, 1EB = 1024 PB, 1PB = 1024 TB) of ultra-large storage space, providing possibilities for storing massive amounts of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numerous Partition Numbers:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike MBR which can only partition a maximum of 4 primary partitions, GPT allows the creation of up to 128 partitions, giving users and system administrators great flexibility whether it‚Äôs partitioning multiple system partitions, data partitions, or reserving partitions for special purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Reliability:&lt;/strong&gt; The GPT partition table employs redundancy backup mechanisms, storing information about the partition table in both the head and tail of the hard drive. When one partition table fails, the system can automatically restore from the other backup, greatly reducing the risk of data loss due to partition table failures, ensuring data security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-structural-analysis&#34;&gt;2. Structural Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GPT partition table consists of multiple components, including a protected MBR (maintained as a small portion of the traditional BIOS structure for compatibility with legacy BIOS and not used for actual partition management), a GPT header (storing basic information about the GPT partition table such as partition table version, number of partitions, partition table size, etc.), and a partition entry array (each partition entry details key information such as the starting sector, ending sector, partition type GUID, and unique identifier for each partition). These structures work together to precisely plan and manage disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-windows-operating-system--the-users-digital-interaction-heaven&#34;&gt;Four. Windows Operating System ‚Äì The User‚Äôs ‚ÄúDigital Interaction Heaven‚Äù
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows, as the world‚Äôs most widely used operating system, builds a friendly bridge between people and computer hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-fusion-of-esp-and-gpt-partition-tables&#34;&gt;1. Fusion of ESP and GPT Partition Tables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Windows system installation based on UEFI booting, the installer automatically creates an ESP (Extensible Firmware Interface) partition and deploys boot files to it. Simultaneously, the hard drive is initialized with a GPT (GUID Partition Table) partition scheme, dividing it into system reserved partitions (used for storing critical system files, similar to the system boot file area in traditional BIOS), Windows system partitions (where the core system files are installed), and other user-defined data partitions. The Windows system relies on the GPT partition table to precisely identify each partition, enabling seamless booting through the ESP partition, and ensuring a smooth boot and usage experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-system-management-and-optimization-based-on&#34;&gt;2. System Management and Optimization Based on
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During operation, Windows fully utilizes the advantages of the GPT partition table for disk management. For example, in the Disk Management tool, it can easily identify GPT partitions, allowing users to create, delete, format, and adjust partition sizes ‚Äì meeting different data storage needs at various stages. Furthermore, processes such as system updates and software installations are closely related to partition layouts.  A rational partition plan helps improve system performance and stability, and reduces issues caused by insufficient disk space or partition confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v-practical-tips-maintenance-and-troubleshooting&#34;&gt;V. Practical Tips: Maintenance and Troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you understand their close relationship, daily maintenance and troubleshooting have a clear path to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-disk-space-management&#34;&gt;1. Disk Space Management
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly check ESP partition space to avoid running out of space due to installing too many startup-related software, which can affect system boot. For data partitions under GPT partitions, plan storage appropriately, promptly clean up unnecessary files, and prevent a single partition from filling up to impact system operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-troubleshooting-startup-failures&#34;&gt;2. Troubleshooting Startup Failures
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you encounter a system that cannot start, first check if the ESP (Extensible Partition Table) partition is damaged or files are missing. You can use the startup repair tool built into the UEFI firmware, or enter the Windows recovery environment using an installation media to rebuild the boot files of the ESP partition. If you suspect a GPT (GUID Partition Table) partition table failure, use a professional disk utility (such as DiskGenius) to check the integrity of the partition table and attempt to repair it by restoring backup partition information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ESP partition, GPT partition table, and Windows operating system are like a precise team working together, each playing its own role to create a stable and efficient computer usage environment for us. Understanding them deeply not only helps us handle system installation and maintenance with confidence, but also allows us to understand the underlying logic of computer operation and explore the digital world. At the same time, reflecting on the rise and fall of the MBR (Master Boot Record) partition table reminds us of the power of technological progress, which has driven storage technology to continuously advance to meet the growing data storage needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deeply understand GCC, GLIBC, and C&#43;&#43; program compatibility issues</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/gcc-glibc-cpp-compatibility/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 19:51:16 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/gcc-glibc-cpp-compatibility/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the C++ development field, GCC and GLIBC are two indispensable key elements, and compatibility issues after program release often trouble developers. This article will delve into their essence, explore the root causes of compatibility problems, and investigate coping strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-gcc-a-powerful-compiler-cornerstone&#34;&gt;I. GCC: A Powerful Compiler Cornerstone
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition and Function&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCC, or GNU Compiler Collection, is an open-source compiler suite developed by the GNU Project. It‚Äôs far from a simple compiler; it supports a wide range of mainstream languages including C, C++, Objective - C, Fortran, Ada, and Go, providing a one-stop solution for cross-language development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking C++ as an example, when we write a source file containing complex features like classes, templates, and function overloading, GCC can translate this high-level C++ code into a sequence of instructions that the underlying machine can understand and execute, based on C++‚Äôs strict syntax and semantics. This process involves multiple fine-grained stages such as lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detailed Compilation Process&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preprocessing Stage:&lt;/strong&gt;  GCC first performs preprocessing operations on the source file. During this stage, it handles all preprocessor directives starting with &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;, such as &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt; directive embeds the entire content of a specified header file (e.g., &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for C++ input/output stream operations) into the corresponding location in the source file, allowing the program to use functions, classes, and other resources declared in the header file.  &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; directives used to expand macros are also replaced during this stage, such as &lt;code&gt;#define PI 3.14159&lt;/code&gt;. All occurrences of &lt;code&gt;PI&lt;/code&gt; in the source file are then replaced with &lt;code&gt;3.14159&lt;/code&gt;. After preprocessing, the source file is initially ‚Äúexpanded.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compilation Stage:&lt;/strong&gt; The preprocessed file enters the compilation phase, where GCC translates the source file into assembly language code based on the C++ language standard. It carefully checks the code structure to ensure that class inheritance and polymorphism are implemented correctly, and that function call parameters match, and it will generate an error if any syntax or semantic errors are found. For example, if the function declaration does not match the definition‚Äôs parameter list, GCC will accurately pinpoint the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assembly Stage:&lt;/strong&gt; The assembler converts the generated assembly code into machine code, producing object files with a &lt;code&gt;.o&lt;/code&gt; extension. These object files contain binary instructions that can be directly executed by the machine, but they cannot run independently because a complete program is typically composed of multiple modules, and function and variable references between these modules have not been resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linking Stage:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the final sprint to generate an executable file. The linker integrates multiple object files and required libraries (static or dynamic) together. For example, when using standard template library containers like &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;, linking requires finding the corresponding library implementation code to ensure that the program can correctly call the functions of these containers at runtime.  Ultimately, a complete executable program is generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-glibc-the-backbone-of-c-program-execution&#34;&gt;II. GLIBC: The Backbone of C++ Program Execution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature and Function&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GLIBC, or the GNU C Library, is a concrete implementation of the C standard library within the GNU ecosystem. Although its name emphasizes C, C++ programs also heavily rely on it because C++ inherits its foundational parts. It provides a vast array of basic functions, such as those for memory management ‚Äì &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; (dynamic memory allocation) and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; (memory deallocation), which are indispensable when creating dynamic arrays and objects in C++; string manipulation functions like &lt;code&gt;strcpy&lt;/code&gt; (string copy) and &lt;code&gt;strcat&lt;/code&gt; (string concatenation), even though C++ has a more advanced &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; class, they‚Äôre still used at the underlying level when interacting with C code or striving for extreme performance; and standard input/output functions like &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt;, which frequently appear in early C++ development and scenarios where performance sensitivity and succinctness are paramount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration with the Operating System&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GLIBC acts as a crucial bridge between the operating system and applications. In Linux systems, when a C++ program initiates a system call ‚Äì for example, to open a file (using the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; function, which is implemented through GLIBC), GLIBC encapsulates the program‚Äôs request in accordance with the kernel&amp;rsquo;s prescribed format and passes it to the kernel for processing. Once the kernel completes its task, GLIBC returns the results to the application. It allows applications to utilize various system resources ‚Äì such as the file system, network, and process management ‚Äì without needing to delve into the complex details of the operating system‚Äôs underlying system call interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-compatibility-issues-after-c-program-publishing-an-analysis&#34;&gt;III. Compatibility Issues After C++ Program Publishing: An Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatibility Dilemmas Triggered by Differences in GLIBC Version&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different Linux distributions often host different versions of GLIBC. When a C++ program is compiled in an environment with a newer version of GLIBC, it may unknowingly utilize certain new function features or rely on optimized function implementations introduced in that version. For example, the new GLIBC version has improved memory allocation algorithms, and the program frequently utilizes this new algorithm to enhance performance at runtime. Once this program is ported to a lower-version GLIBC system, it may encounter issues such as failing to find the corresponding function (because the lower version did not introduce that function) or abnormal function behavior (the old version&amp;rsquo;s function implementation logic differs from the new version), leading to program crashes or incorrect results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatibility Risks Due to Compiler Differences&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if using the same GCC compiler, different versions of GCC differ in code generation, standard library support, and the details of their implementations for C++ features. Newer GCC versions may have full support for the latest C++ standards (such as new modules in C++20 like coroutines), and if a program uses these advanced features and compiles under an older version of GCC, the compiler will error out due to its inability to recognize these new syntax structures; even without syntax errors, different GCC versions have different optimization strategies, which can lead to significant differences in machine code generated in terms of execution efficiency and memory usage, potentially causing the program to behave differently in different environments when performance requirements are stringent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges Posed by Architectural Differences&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++ programs may need to run on different hardware architectures, such as x86, ARM, PowerPC, etc. Different architectures have their own unique instruction sets, memory layouts, and data alignment requirements. Taking data alignment as an example, a structure data storage layout that runs normally on the x86 architecture may cause memory access exceptions on the ARM architecture due to different alignment rules, leading to program errors; moreover, GCC generates huge differences in machine code when compiling for different architectures, if the program contains hardcoded architectural-related instructions or assumptions, it will inevitably fail when running across architectures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-strategies-for-addressing-compatibility-issues&#34;&gt;Four. Strategies for Addressing Compatibility Issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utilization of Static Link Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using static link libraries, packaging the code of dependent libraries such as GLIBC directly into the executable file. This eliminates the program‚Äôs reliance on a specific GLIBC version on the target system at runtime, effectively preventing issues arising from GLIBC version mismatches. However, static linking significantly increases the size of the executable file, requiring a trade-off in resource-constrained scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containerized Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leveraging containerization technologies like Docker, encapsulate the C++ program and its required runtime environment (including specific versions of GCC, GLIBC, etc.) within an independent container. Regardless of the underlying operating system to which it is deployed, the container maintains consistency with the development environment, ensuring the program runs as expected and greatly simplifies cross-environment deployment complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatibility Testing and Continuous Integration&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a comprehensive compatibility testing system covering different GLIBC versions, GCC versions, and common architectures. During the software development process, use continuous integration tools to perform automated testing on multiple environments regularly.  Promptly fix any compatibility issues discovered, eliminating potential problems in their infancy and guaranteeing stability after program deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, a deep understanding of the workings of GCC and GLIBC, accurately identifying the root causes of C++ program compatibility issues, flexibly applying response strategies, is an essential skill for every C++ developer to create robust, cross-platform applications. Only then can our C++ works run unimpeded in diverse technological ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Windows Built-in Disk Cleanup Tool: Storage</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-disk-cleanup-storage/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure from what version it started, but in &lt;code&gt;Windows 11&lt;/code&gt;, the Disk Cleanup tool has been significantly improved and become much smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is that it&amp;rsquo;s an official tool, so it won‚Äôt accidentally delete files, won‚Äôt have ads, won‚Äôt have pop-ups, won‚Äôt have background processes, or any unnecessary elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access the Disk Cleanup tool in &lt;code&gt;Windows 11&lt;/code&gt; by going to &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Storage &amp;gt; Temporary Files&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;322px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ordinary users, simply selecting ‚ÄúClean up‚Äù is sufficient; the system will provide suggestions based on your usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I have many temporary files on my disk, so I choose ‚ÄúTemporary Files,‚Äù which contains items like &lt;code&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/code&gt; temporary files and &lt;code&gt;Windows Update&lt;/code&gt; temporary files, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Docker Domestic Mirror Proxy Failed</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/docker-domestic-image-proxy-failure/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 18:29:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/docker-domestic-image-proxy-failure/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Deploying Docker on domestic servers, after deployment, if the company doesn‚Äôt provide a registry center, the first thing developers need to do is configure a domestic registry mirror address. It&amp;rsquo;s lucky that today there was a server configured with a registry mirror address, but when pulling images, it kept failing to pull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error response from daemon: ‚Äúhttps://registry-1.docker.io/v2/‚Äù: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- 20250106 ‚Äì Two days after, all servers were restored, and this didn‚Äôt even make the news! All domestic registry mirrors went down --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting-and-repair-attempts&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting and Repair Attempts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, we attempted to switch to alternative mirror acceleration addresses, hoping to resolve the issue. However, as expected, the problem persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, we began modifying the local DNS configuration in an attempt to find a breakthrough at the network resolution level. Unfortunately, after debugging, the fault remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the stability of the local network was heavily questioned, so we decisively switched to a mobile hotspot, attempting to bypass potential local network faults. However, the result was discouraging ‚Äì there were no signs of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-propagation&#34;&gt;Problem Propagation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We currently have &lt;strong&gt;a few servers deployed domestically&lt;/strong&gt; with Docker environments, and all of them failed to successfully pull the image. We initially hoped to find an alternative solution, but we found that they all consistently failed with identical error messages, indicating that the issue isn&amp;rsquo;t isolated to a single device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further investigation revealed that the image proxy seemingly malfunctioned instantaneously. In this critical moment, we quickly switched to a machine outside of the country, and thankfully, image pulls were restored at this location. This suggests that the problem is likely related to the domestic network links or associated configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strategy-adjustment-circumventing-the-issue&#34;&gt;Strategy Adjustment: Circumventing the Issue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that direct image pulling methods within China have been heavily restricted, while foreign mirrors remain accessible, to expedite project progress, we‚Äôve decided to employ a circumvention tactic. Initially, we switched to foreign servers to successfully pull the required images, subsequently pushing them to domestic mirror repositories to establish a ‚Äúdata bridge.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we synchronized modifications to the Dockerfile files, replacing image addresses with those adapted for the Chinese environment and then rebuilt the images, ultimately achieving successful deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The End of the Age of Wild Capitalism: The Era of League of Legends Esports Concludes</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-league-of-legends-era/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:19:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-league-of-legends-era/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The esports industry has experienced rapid development over the past decade and a half, becoming an increasingly significant cultural phenomenon worldwide. Particularly MOBA games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; (LoL), which is often abbreviated as LOL, not only provide players with the joy of competition but also inject powerful momentum into capital, driving the flourishing development of various esports platforms and events. However, all of this has entered a phase of gradual decline with the influx of capital and the rise of the entertainment industry. The rise and fall of PandyTV, the competition between DouYu and Huya, marks the end of the ‚Äúwild capitalism era,‚Äù and the favorable conditions ‚Äì time, place, people, and heaven ‚Äì for esports seem to be starting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-injection&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Injection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1 The Early Days of Electronic Sports: From Grassroots to Professionalization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early esports industry started relatively grassroots, especially in China. Many players participated in competitive games like &lt;em&gt;StarCraft&lt;/em&gt; and Dota, driven by their passion for the games. However, the true rise of esports began with the release and promotion of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Following the official entry of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; into the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche community to part of mainstream culture. Notably starting in 2013, the LPL (China Professional League) was established, and &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; became the cornerstone of China‚Äôs esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.2 Capital Frenzy Influx: The Rise of PandaTV and Esports Live Streaming Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 marked a watershed moment for the Chinese esports industry. The influx of capital transformed esports from a purely competitive event into a much larger ecosystem. PandaTV, one of the representatives, became a product of excessive capital. Invested by one of its founders, Wang Sicong, PandaTV quickly rose to prominence with its innovative content and massive investment, attracting a large number of viewers and users. However, this was also a typical example of capital ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù inflow ‚Äì the relentless pursuit of markets often lacks patience and long-term vision. Although PandaTV‚Äôs short-term investments achieved certain results due to management issues and excessive reliance on high fever caused by capital, it ultimately declared bankruptcy in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.3 Live Streaming Platform Competition: The ‚ÄúCapital War‚Äù Between DouYu and Huya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demise of PandaTV did not lead to the decline of the esports live streaming industry; instead, it propelled the rise of platforms like Douyu and Huya. Douyu and Huya became leading players in the esports industry, and their competition intensified. Early on, Douyu established itself as a benchmark for esports live streaming through the broadcasting of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; professional competitions and the signing of top streamers. Huya, meanwhile, gradually narrowed the gap with Douyu by increasing its investment in esports events and diversifying its platform layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, capital played a huge role again. In 2018, Douyu successfully went public, and Huya also completed its IPO the same year. The rapid flow of capital led to industry consolidation and intensified competition between platforms in terms of streamers and copyrights, forming a ‚Äúcapital war.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-fusion-of-mass-entertainment-and-esports&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Fusion of Mass Entertainment and Esports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1 The Trend Towards Mass Entertainment: Capital Flows into Diversified Entertainment Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As capital has heavily invested in the esports industry, esports platform content is gradually becoming mass-entertained. Esports anchors are no longer limited to match commentary and event live streaming; they have begun to expand into singing, dancing, interactive live streams, and other entertainment forms. The content on platforms is becoming more diverse, gradually forming an ecosystem centered around esports but also incorporating various entertainment elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this mass entertainment trend has also brought problems ‚Äì the original focus of esports culture has been marginalized, replaced by a trend of entertainment above all else. This trend has caused some fans who originally loved esports culture to feel alienated, and capital has begun to pay more attention to other entertainment fields. The excessive influx of capital and profit-seeking behavior have gradually blurred the essence of the esports industry, and the original value concept centered around competition has been weakened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2 The Rise of Mass Entertainment Industry: Capital Withdrawal and Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and the entertainment industry have risen, capital has gradually shifted funds from esports to a wider range of entertainment content. In this process, giants such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance no longer rely solely on esports projects as sources of revenue, but are increasing their investments in areas such as film, music, and short videos.  In particular, the rise of ByteDance, through the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin (TikTok), has overshadowed the limelight of esports with other entertainment content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-league-of-legends-yellow-not-following-yellow-the-decline-of-the-eras-advantage&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: League of Legends‚Äô ‚ÄúYellow Not Following Yellow‚Äù: The Decline of the Era‚Äôs Advantage
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has almost become synonymous with China&amp;rsquo;s esports industry, achieving countless professional players, teams, and events, and also spawning a massive esports ecosystem. However, after more than ten years, as a leading project in Chinese esports, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; has entered a phase of ‚ÄúYellow Not Following Yellow‚Äù ‚Äì a period of decline. Particularly in recent years, the influence of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; is gradually waning, even exhibiting obvious signs of recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1 The ‚ÄúFracture‚Äù in Player Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most noticeable change is the fragmentation of player groups. Initially, esports‚Äô rapid development relied on the support of a large number of young players, many of whom became professional players or spectators thanks to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. That generation of &amp;ldquo;internet addiction&amp;rdquo; teenagers almost grew up under the ‚Äúera‚Äôs advantage,‚Äù immersed in the competitive charm of LOL and thus driving the rapid expansion of the entire industry. However, as time went on, these players gradually matured, entered society, and began to shift towards other life and career paths. At the same time, a new generation of young players are not as enthusiastic about &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; as in its heyday, and the esports audience has exhibited a clear age bias and decline in interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2 The ‚ÄúWeakness‚Äù in Game Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, after multiple updates and revisions, still maintains a certain competitive charm, but the game‚Äôs own innovation in content appears somewhat lacking. Each year&amp;rsquo;s version updates, hero balance adjustments, and new gameplay introductions seem unable to fundamentally address players‚Äô demand for freshness. Meanwhile, the MOBA market has become saturated, and other types of games (such as &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Game For Peace&lt;/em&gt;) have rapidly risen, diverting a large number of players who originally belonged to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. This competitive situation has left &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; unable to escape the role of ‚Äúfollower.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-where-does-the-esports-industry-go-from-here&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Where Does the Esports Industry Go From Here?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The esports industry is like a skyscraper that sprung up seemingly overnight, with excessive capital roaming the internet sector, searching for the next big trend ‚Äì and esports has become one of their targets. Leveraging China‚Äôs demographic dividend, the industry achieved tremendous success in a short period, but this success wasn&amp;rsquo;t built on a solid foundation. Excessive capital influx, talent shortages, and weak game content are all hindering the healthy development of the esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to university, I didn‚Äôt play many games; Alliance essentially accompanied my growth alongside generations. I watched countless World Finals, and as an outsider, comparing ourselves to Korean and Chinese players, especially Faker, domestic players always felt hesitant during major tournaments. I also know that athletes face immense psychological pressure, but this hasn&amp;rsquo;t been prioritized by teams. Over a decade of development, these mental health issues should be taken seriously, yet they weren‚Äôt. Domestic gameplay still relies on the innate talent of the players themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Games to Home: Why We Gradually Distance Ourselves from the Virtual World as We Grow Up</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-leave-virtual-worlds-as-we-grow-up/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:11:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-leave-virtual-worlds-as-we-grow-up/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to when you feel the most joy playing games, as a child, sneaking onto your parents‚Äô TV to play Tank War, Super Mario, or Space Invaders, or secretly using your home computer with your cousin to play Age of Empires, or even in college, playing Devil May Cry and League of Legends with roommates ‚Äì those were the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, without the worries of life, when you played, you truly immersed yourself completely. That sense of immersion is something you can never find again as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the changes in society and progress, we gradually realized that the virtual world where we once thrived was becoming further away from our lives. The disconnection of game social links, accompanied by players falling out of line, isn&amp;rsquo;t just due to technological advancements and the replacement of games themselves; it‚Äôs also because our focus has shifted. As we get older, we start busy with marriage and having children, and our main life path has gradually shifted from personal entertainment to family responsibilities. Today, let‚Äôs talk about the underlying reasons behind this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disappearance-of-gaming-socialization-a-tug-of-war-between-virtual-and-real-worlds&#34;&gt;The Disappearance of Gaming Socialization: A Tug-of-War Between Virtual and Real Worlds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people‚Äôs youth, games were more than just entertainment; they were a social way of life. A popular multiplayer online game didn&amp;rsquo;t just offer in-game challenges and competition ‚Äì it connected players from all over the world, building virtual social circles. Back then, playing dungeons together with friends, forming teams for PvP combat, was part of everyday life. Those late-night voice chats and sharing of daily experiences became a cherished memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as time went on, more and more players realized that this virtual socialization experience didn‚Äôt have lasting appeal. With the constant evolution of games and the diversification of social platforms, players gradually found more interactive ways outside of gaming. Friends made in games eventually faded from view, and many formerly active social connections within games quietly fractured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gaming-and-responsibility-the-shift-in-focus-of-adult-life&#34;&gt;Gaming and Responsibility: The Shift in Focus of Adult Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you enter adulthood, responsibilities gradually increase. Many young people once invested a significant amount of time in games, but as their careers begin or they start living with partners and forming families, these activities that previously seemed indispensable entertainment are increasingly squeezed by the demands of real-life responsibility. Marriage, having children, even caring for parents, these major life responsibilities force individuals to make choices about their energy and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming becomes a thing of the past, replaced by the priority of family life. Many young people who once ‚Äúfought‚Äù in games gradually discover that real life is the most important subject. Especially after having children, the focus of life completely shifts towards family, and gaming is gradually pushed to the periphery of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-games-to-home-how-changes-in-life-are-affecting-our-entertainment&#34;&gt;From Games to Home: How Changes in Life Are Affecting Our Entertainment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within our life experiences, the family is one of the most important components. And once you enter family life, the division of time and energy becomes more specific and limited. Many young parents find that they no longer have enough time to focus on games they used to love, as they dedicate themselves to caring for children and spending time with their spouses. Sometimes, they even stop chasing updates and new features in games. Gradually, social platforms and offline interactions with friends and family have become the preferred way for many people to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn‚Äôt mean we completely abandon entertainment activities; it simply means we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen ways that better suit our current life stage. Many friends who were originally accustomed to maintaining contact through games may choose other methods of connection due to different life trajectories, such as family gatherings, dinners, short trips, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-farewell-of-virtual-worlds-how-do-we-view-this-transition&#34;&gt;The Farewell of Virtual Worlds: How Do We View This Transition?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many who once immersed themselves in games, saying goodbye to gaming social wasn‚Äôt easy. After all, the virtual world that had once brought us joy and accomplishment had long become a part of our memories. However, farewell doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean complete severance; it‚Äôs about making different choices as life changes, balancing our roles in real-life. As we grow older from youthful adolescence into responsible adults, games may still hold value, but they can no longer be the main rhythm of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this transition also reflects a facet of human adaptability ‚Äì our ability to adjust our focus and lifestyle as different stages of life unfold. When responsibility and family become central to our lives, gaming social is no longer a priority, but rather an occasional leisure activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-of-gaming-perhaps-well-see-another-wave-of-sense-of-belonging&#34;&gt;The Future of Gaming: Perhaps We‚Äôll See Another Wave of ‚ÄúSense of Belonging‚Äù
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, as society and technology continue to develop, the forms and content of games are constantly evolving. For example, modern multiplayer online games have begun to evolve towards more relaxed and flexible ways, with some designs even focusing on family interaction and parent-child relationships. In the future, we may see more game formats that can better integrate into family life and provide players with healthier, more balanced social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as many people reminisce about ‚Äúgames from their childhood‚Äù with nostalgia and passion, perhaps in the future we will also pick up those games again at an unexpected moment, with new understanding and insight, and step back into that virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;living-in-change-yet-still-loving&#34;&gt;Living in Change, Yet Still Loving
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it‚Äôs gaming or family life, the changes in our lives always accompany us as we grow. In this process, we gradually realize that, although the virtual world brings us endless joy and excitement, ultimately, we will return to reality, back to the warmest place of all ‚Äì family. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to regret leaving games behind because every stage of life has its own unique meaning. And these changes are what make us a more complete person.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hong Kong Exchange, History of Virtual Currency Development</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-exchange-virtual-currency-history/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:00:28 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-exchange-virtual-currency-history/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin once again elected as US President, also bringing virtual currencies back into the public eye. The Hong Kong Exchange has been actively deploying related business, and here‚Äôs a brief record of its virtual currency development history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the details of relevant contract listings, we found that the initial introduction wasn&amp;rsquo;t spot contracts but futures ‚Äì which was reasonable due to their better liquidity and easier attraction of institutional investors. Subsequently introducing spot ETFs was also sensible, as they are a more readily accepted investment tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;virtual-currency-list&#34;&gt;Virtual Currency List
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchange‚Äôs market data does not provide identifiers to distinguish between contracts that are virtual currencies. However, they can be determined by the contract name. The official trading list provides corresponding subcategories &lt;code&gt;virtualasset&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.hkex.com.hk/Market-Data/Securities-Prices/Exchange-Traded-Products?sc_lang=en&amp;amp;asset=virtualasset&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.hkex.com.hk/Market-Data/Securities-Prices/Exchange-Traded-Products?sc_lang=en&amp;amp;asset=virtualasset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;december-16-2022&#34;&gt;December 16, 2022
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;hong-kong-exchange-welcomes-first-batch-of-crypto-asset-etfs-in-asia&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Exchange Welcomes First Batch of Crypto Asset ETFs in Asia
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) today (Friday) welcomed the listing of the first batch of crypto asset ETFs in Asia, further expanding its product ecosystem and providing more choices for investors in Hong Kong and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two new ETFs listed today ‚Äì Southern East One Bitcoin Futures ETF (stock code: 3066) and Southern East One Ethereum Futures ETF (stock code: 3068) ‚Äì are managed by Southern East One Asset Management Co., Ltd. and track standardized, cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts and ether futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe two crypto asset ETFs listed today add another layer of richness to Hong Kong‚Äôs increasingly diverse exchange trading product ecosystem,‚Äù said Mr. Yao Jia Ren, Chief Operating Officer and Head of Market Development at HKEX. ‚ÄúThese new products will provide investors in Asia for the first time with an opportunity to participate in digital asset investment, reflecting our focus on the digital economy and market demand. We look forward to bringing more thematic ETFs and digital asset products in the coming months.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETF is one of the fastest-growing businesses under HKEX, with its product range continuously expanding and becoming increasingly diversified, including the launch of Hong Kong‚Äôs first Metaverse ETF, first Carbon Futures ETF, and first Blockchain ETF within the year. It also marked the first time ETFs were included in theÊª¨Ê∑±Ê∏ØÈÄö (HKSG Connect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the average daily trading volume of HKEX&amp;rsquo;s buy-and-sell products (ETPs ‚Äì including ETFs and leveraged and inverse products) for the first eleven months of this year reached HK$118 billion, a 50% increase from last year‚Äôs same period of HK$78 billion, reflecting the growing popularity of ETPs among investors. As of November 2022, there were 168 ETPs listed on HKEX with a market capitalization of HK$3,735 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) today (Tuesday) welcomed the listing of Asia‚Äôs first batch of spot virtual asset ETFs, adding to the variety of products in the Hong Kong market and providing investors with more choices, further solidifying Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s position as a leading ETF market in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúToday‚Äôs newly listed spot virtual asset ETFs will enrich the diversified and dynamic ETF market ecosystem of the Hong Kong Exchange, offering investors new investment opportunities in asset classes,‚Äù said Robert Lin, Head of Securities Product Development at HKEX. ‚ÄúFollowing the successful launch of the first virtual asset futures ETF a year ago, these first Asian spot virtual asset ETFs will further enhance the product variety and liquidity for the Hong Kong Exchange‚Äôs buy-and-sell products. We look forward to continuing to work closely with market stakeholders to introduce more new products into our internationalized market.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first batch of virtual asset futures ETFs, which were listed in 2022, have been favored by investors and traded actively. The average daily trading volume of the three spot virtual asset ETFs listed on HKEX increased from HK$890 million in 2023 to HK$5.13 billion in the first quarter of 2024, while attracting HK$5.29 billion in inflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchange-traded products (ETPs), including ETFs, leveraged and inverse products, are one of the fastest-growing markets for HKEX, with the product variety continuously increasing over the past year. The 16 new ETPs launched in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 include the first Saudi Arabian ETF in the Asia Pacific region, Hong Kong‚Äôs first callable option ETFs, and currently there are 179 ETPs listed on HKEX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;hong-kong-exchange-to-launch-virtual-asset-index-series&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Exchange to Launch Virtual Asset Index Series
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) announced today (Monday) that it will launch the Hong Kong Exchange Virtual Asset Indices Series (the ‚ÄúSeries‚Äù) on November 15, 2024, providing a reliable benchmark price for the rapidly growing asset class of virtual assets, supporting Hong Kong‚Äôs development as a leading digital asset hub in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index series will provide transparent and reliable benchmarks for pricing Bitcoin and Ethereum within the Asian time zone, aiming to offer a unified reference price for virtual assets, addressing price discrepancies between this asset class across global exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HKEX Group Chief Executive Officer Chen Yiting stated: ‚ÄúWe are pleased to launch the Hong Kong Exchange Virtual Asset Indices Series to meet the demand for this rapidly growing asset class regionally. By providing transparent and reliable real-time benchmarks, we hope to help investors make informed investment decisions, supporting the healthy development of the virtual assets ecosystem and solidifying Hong Kong‚Äôs position as an international financial center.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of the index series is part of HKEX&amp;rsquo;s commitment to exploring emerging areas, supporting the development of Hong Kong fintech while also providing investors with important benchmarks and solutions in a constantly evolving market environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index series will include reference indices for Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as reference exchange rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference indices are based on the weighted average spot price of Bitcoin or Ethereum over 24 hours‚Äô trading volume, calculated using aggregated market prices from major virtual asset exchanges, and denominated in US dollars in real-time. The reference exchange rate is designed for financial product settlement and is calculated daily at 4:00 PM Hong Kong time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index series will be the first virtual asset index series developed in Hong Kong that complies with European Union Benchmark Regulation (EUBMR) standards, managed and calculated jointly by a benchmark management company registered in the UK and a virtual assets data and index provider, CCData.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region issued a policy statement on the development of virtual assets, hoping to cultivate a vibrant virtual asset industry and ecosystem in Hong Kong. The launch of the Hong Kong Exchange Virtual Asset Indices Series will help the public increase their understanding of virtual asset investment trends through providing real-time data and daily reference prices within the Asian time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details regarding the design and calculation methods of the index series will be announced as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>‚ÄúFee reduction, fee reduction! Domestic mega-ETFs are experiencing a large-scale fee reduction.‚Äù</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/etf-fees-cut-china/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 03:08:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/etf-fees-cut-china/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hua Tai Bei Rui HongShan 300 ETF and related funds issued a notice lowering the overall fee rate to the lowest among peers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 19th, Hua Tai Bei Rui Fund announced that, in order to better meet the investment and financial needs of investors, starting from November 22nd, Hua Tai Bei Rui HongShan 300 ETF and its related funds will lower their management fees and custodial fees, and revise relevant fund contract contents.
&lt;strong&gt;After the adjustment, the annual management fee for Hua Tai Bei Rui HongShan 300 ETF and its related funds is reduced to 0.15%, and the annual custodial fee is reduced to 0.05%, all set to the lowest rate among index funds.&lt;/strong&gt;
Almost simultaneously, other leading industry ETFs such as Huaxia HongShan 300 ETF, Huaxia ShangZheng 50 ETF, Nanfang ZhongCheng 500 ETF, JiaShi HongShan 300 ETF, and YiFangDa Entrepreneurial Board ETF also issued notices lowering management and custodial fees, with all rates reduced to 0.15% and 0.05%.
Unlike previous ETF rate reductions, this reduction was initiated by market-leading products with significant scale advantages, which will have a substantial impact on the industry‚Äôs subsequent developments. Exchange data showed that as of November 18th, Hua Tai Bei Rui HongShan 300 ETF had a scale exceeding 370 billion yuan, making it currently the largest ETF in terms of size.
The largest batch of super ETFs leading the way in reducing fees demonstrated their proactive willingness to benefit investors and allowed investors to invest in popular and liquid products at higher value for money.
Industry analysts believe that ETFs with significant scale advantages lowering fees will, on one hand, facilitate the public fund‚Äôs role in providing inclusive financial services, helping investors reduce holding costs and enhance returns and investment satisfaction across a wider area;
On the other hand, low rates will also further improve the competitiveness of the products themselves. With the added benefits of liquidity diversion effects and cost operation advantages, the products are expected to attract more medium-to-long term incremental funds into the market, helping build a good ecosystem for ‚Äúlong money long investment.‚Äù
In recent years, thanks to its flexible trading, high transparency, strong liquidity, low investment barriers, and other unique advantages, broad-based ETFs have become the main channel for capital entering at low levels and ‚Äúlong money long investment.‚Äù
This reduction in fees may serve as an &amp;ldquo;accelerator,&amp;rdquo; making it easier for long-term funds to enter the A-share market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Tianhong Fund that I invested in hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet released an announcement, it should be followed up on. If no update is provided, I will consider switching funds.
Original Management Fee: 0.5%, Custody Fee: 0.1%. New Management Fee: 0.15%, Custody Fee: 0.05%. This reduction is quite significant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>‚ÄúIncreased scrutiny of third-party advisor regulation, and the beneficiaries behind the ‚ÄòDouyin (TikTok) stock trading‚Äô phenomenon face a crackdown?‚Äù</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/third-party-wealth-managers-scrutiny-tiktok-stock-winners-crackdown/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:59:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/third-party-wealth-managers-scrutiny-tiktok-stock-winners-crackdown/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hammer is falling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the surge of short videos, investment advisory services are reportedly entering a fast lane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In late September, after a period of intense activity in the A-share market, Douyin (TikTok) recommendations for stocks garnered attention from various parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerous financial commentators have risen to prominence on Douyin, indirectly causing some volatility in capital markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behind these rapidly rising financial commentators lies a significant force: third-party investment advisory service companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs understood that many third-party advisory firms operate multiple accounts on short video platforms, using content distribution (ÊäïÊµÅ) to attract users to watch investment teaching videos and boost enthusiasm for purchasing corresponding products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are even rumors that one third-party advisory firm achieved revenue of 10 billion yuan in October alone, exceeding its first-half earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, ‚Äúgood times‚Äù are facing more uncertainties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since November, multiple departments have issued notices requiring securities service institutions to strengthen the compliance management of self-media accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On November 15th, Futu Securities (300033.SZ) announced that a subsidiary was penalized by the China Securities Regulatory Commission for engaging in suggestive stock recommendations through livestreaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may be signaling a stricter regulatory environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The expansion of third-party investment advisory service firms like Fangyuan Intelligence Investment (9636.HK) is likely to face greater pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;close-monitoring-by-regulators&#34;&gt;Close Monitoring by Regulators
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of short video platforms like Douyin (TikTok) has amplified emotional voices and indirectly impacted trading behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Giant Network, from September 27th to October 8th, when transaction volumes hit record highs, the Douyin A-share keyword search index soared from 4.2384 million to 12.7786 million, expanding by more than twice that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under these circumstances, the ‚Äústirring up‚Äù behavior of third-party investment advisory firms is attracting the attention of regulatory authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment advisors recommending stocks through live broadcasts constitutes a high-frequency violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 8th, the Guangdong Securities Regulatory Bureau took measures to suspend new clients for a company‚Äôs livestreaming that presented ‚Äúimplicit stock recommendations.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 14th evening, the Guangdong Securities and Futures Industry Association issued an announcement titled &amp;ldquo;Live Streaming Control Lacking Effectiveness, Institutions Suspended Business,&amp;rdquo; directly addressing situations where some institutions with securities consulting qualifications had inadequate controls during live streaming operations and engaged in recommending stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guangdong Securities and Futures Industry Association stated: ‚ÄúStrictly prohibit livestreaming stock recommendations. Livestreaming is a public media dissemination platform, and livestreaming personnel, regardless of whether they are registered as securities investment advisors, shall not recommend stocks during live broadcasts.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an isolated case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, the Shanghai Securities Regulatory Bureau disclosed a penalty notice involving illegal stock recommendations on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following regulatory investigation, Wang Yong, a consultant at Haishun Securities Investment Consulting Co., Ltd.‚Äôs Shanghai branch, violated professional norms by publishing misleading videos through WeChat Video No., which contradicted industry standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Securities Regulatory Bureau subsequently issued a supervisory management measure to issue a warning letter to Wang Yong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Wind (ID:TradeWind01) information, some unqualified investment advisory firms have been using ‚Äúrented‚Äù brokerage accounts to promote stocks on Douyin and have since been suspended from broadcasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúSome people are livestreaming in the industry, but they are actually renting under a brokerage firm, which gives them investment advisor qualifications, then they use live streaming to generate leads, and sell investment advisory product bundles offline,‚Äù said a consultant from South China to Wind (ID:TradeWind01). ‚ÄúHowever, because they recommended stocks during the livestreaming, they were discovered and subsequently suspended.‚Äù Regular brokerages typically discuss sector trends but do not involve individual stock recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, regulators are closely monitoring illegal stock recommendations on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Shenzhen Securities Regulatory Bureau recently notified that some institutions or individuals were using self-media to illegally recommend stocks, in order to further regulate the self-media operations of securities investment consulting agencies in theËæñÂå∫, all institutions should further strengthen company self-media operation management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may pose more challenges for the business development of various third-party investment advisory service firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-flow-business-is-false&#34;&gt;‚ÄúThe Flow Business‚Äù is False
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether retail investors who were attracted by short videos made a profit remains unknown, but the valuation of third-party investment advisory service companies as &amp;ldquo;water sellers&amp;rdquo; in the secondary market has soared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs first online teaching stock,‚Äù JiuFang Intelligence‚Äôs market capitalization rose from 2.878 billion yuan at the beginning of September to 12.464 billion yuan on November 13, with an increase of 333.08% over 49 trading days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The semi-annual report showed that in the first half of the year, JiuFang Intelligence conducted brand exposure on social media platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu, and by the end of June, it had 488 accounts and 46 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, as JiuFang Intelligence‚Äôs Chief Investment Advisor, ‚ÄúHongbangzhuxi‚Äù has 2.26 million fans on Douyin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe have deeply cultivated MCN operations, focusing on users, and synergistically promote the comprehensive development of traffic, brands, and products,‚Äù JiuFang Intelligence stated. ‚ÄúBy deeply integrating live streaming, short videos, and other new media tools, leveraging AI technology to build a fan network, and actively exploring e-commerce models, we effectively achieve the efficient conversion of traffic.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JiuFang Intelligence‚Äôs investment advisory course packages cover price ranges from tens of yuan to more than ten‰∏áÂÖÉ. The most expensive package, ‚ÄúSuper Investor,‚Äù is priced at 139,600 yuan per six months, including exclusive insights and private advisor services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, JiuFang Intelligence‚Äôs investment advisory product refund rate is above 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2024, the refund rates for JiuFang Intelligence‚Äôs flagship series and JiuFang Intelligence‚Äôs Qionglong Series reached 14.7% and 18.5%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, under regulatory scrutiny, whether JiuFang Intelligence&amp;rsquo;s business development will be affected remains to be further observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, media reports said that accounts belonging to third-party investment advisory companies such as JiuFang Intelligence have been impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, a media report stated that ‚ÄúHongbangzhuxi‚Äù was suspended from live streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on November 15th, XinFeng (ID:TradeWind01) searched the account and found that the appointment for ‚ÄúHongbangzhuxi‚Äôs‚Äù livestream on November 18th was still available in the livestream interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, market sources said that relevant departments have entered JiuFang Intelligence for inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a close source to JiuFang Intelligence told XinFeng (ID:TradeWind01) that the inspection belonged to routine inspections and had already ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only company involved in this round of regulatory storm rumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reports that Tianhong Securities was investigated for illegal stock recommendations and may suspend business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Tianhong Securities stated on November 15th, ‚ÄúThere were no illegal stock recommendation cases, and there was no investigation.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that same evening, Tianhong Securities announced that its subsidiary Zhejiang Tianhong Cloud Software Co., Ltd. was penalized with a three-month new customer suspension due to inadequate compliance controls in the promotion of livestreaming business and the existence of scenarios suggesting recommendations of stocks, by the Zhejiang Securities Regulatory Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may also mean that regulatory departments are further focusing onËçêËÇ° (recommendation of stocks) content on social media platforms such as Douyin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the cake of short videos has also attracted many securities firms, but due to compliance requirements, securities firms are currently cautious about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A securities industry insider told XinFeng (ID:TradeWind01) that the company is exploring methods for short video operations and lead generation, and it has organized personnel to visit short video platform companies for learning, but due to compliance requirements, it is still in an exploratory stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, behind the various regulatory compliance requirements is because the content on short video platforms has a distinct emotional color, but investment requires market participants to maintain rationality, and the two exist in a natural conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If uncontrolled emotions influence the capital market, it can easily trigger violent fluctuations in the market, which goes against the long-term healthy development of the capital market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What manner should securities holding institutions embrace the arrival of the short video era to avoid ‚Äústepping on red lines‚Äù? This is clearly a difficult question for all parties.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CentOS Stream&lt;/code&gt; is the upstream open-source development platform prior to Red Hat‚Äôs &lt;code&gt;Linux&lt;/code&gt; distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first noticed the open-source operating system lifecycle &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/redhat-centos-lifecycle/&#34; &gt;redhat and centos life cycle&lt;/a&gt; had ended, and I was wondering what was going on. Besides security issues, dnf wasn‚Äôt working, and I recently encountered failures when installing tools ‚Äì checking the repository sources revealed that &lt;code&gt;CentOS 8 Stream&lt;/code&gt; had reached its end of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;centos-stream-introduction&#34;&gt;CentOS Stream Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;positioning-and-roles&#34;&gt;Positioning and Roles
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream sits between Fedora Linux (upstream development) and RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux, downstream development), acting as a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be considered a version for experiencing the latest Red Hat-based Linux features, suitable for those who want to try out new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins-and-background&#34;&gt;Origins and Background
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, Red Hat began to seek more effective ways to develop its enterprise-grade Linux platform, leading to the launch of CentOS Stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentOS 8 ended maintenance at the end of 2021, and CentOS Stream continued to be updated as its successor, becoming the future direction of the CentOS project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-and-advantages&#34;&gt;Features and Advantages
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream is a rolling release Linux distribution that provides faster updates. It offers greater transparency and more opportunities for community, partner, and customer participation, allowing users to contribute to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) more quickly and directly.
The content of CentOS Stream is software that Red Hat intends to include in the next stable version of RHEL, therefore it provides a stable ABI/API for developers and testers within the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-cases-and-target-users&#34;&gt;Use Cases and Target Users
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream is suitable for those CentOS users who want to continue receiving the latest Linux feature updates, as well as developers and partners who wish to participate in Red Hat Enterprise Linux development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also aims to help community members, Red Hat partners, and others take full advantage of innovative open-source software in a more stable and predictable Linux ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hugo Module Customizing Theme: Explanation of Approach</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hugo-module-customizing-themes-ideas/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:01:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hugo-module-customizing-themes-ideas/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Browsing through the historical commit records, the site has undergone numerous theme switches. Each theme switch involved some custom modifications, and this is where I‚Äôm documenting the approach to customizing themes. My &lt;code&gt;Github&lt;/code&gt; repository briefly maintained the even theme, but due to my obsessive-compulsive tendencies, I resisted upgrading the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; compiler to the latest version, which resulted in incompatibility with the even theme, so I switched back to the &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugos-modularity&#34;&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Modularity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we talk about modularity, many people think of Nginx modules and IDEA plugins, among others. Typically, I can upload some modules to satisfy my differentiated needs. The reason everyone likes this kind of module is that it‚Äôs sufficiently flexible ‚Äì you don‚Äôt have to put in too much effort to meet your own requirements. Because often, even though the overall situation is similar, there are always some details that differ. This also illustrates the complexity of software, not just technically but also from a business perspective. Most of the time, we face business complexity. This is precisely where the saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs like crossing a mountain range‚Äù best applies. Today, not only the internet industry and finance, but even traditional manufacturing industries are using information systems to help businesses with their production and management. Even a leave system can have differences between companies in the same industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the modules you might be familiar with, Hugo&amp;rsquo;s modules are different ‚Äì they don‚Äôt focus on meeting differentiated needs based on functionality. Instead, they rely primarily on directory structure to identify identical structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@sunwei.xyz/07-hugo%E6%9E%B6%E6%9E%84-hugo%E7%9A%84%E6%A8%A1%E5%9D%97-8ef5a520a822&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;07. Hugo Architecture ‚Äî Hugo Modules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34;&gt;[[imports]]
path = &amp;quot;github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/v3&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;git submodule&lt;/code&gt; approach can still be used, and this article doesn‚Äôt recommend it. If you introduce a theme, maintaining it will be more complicated ‚Äì you&amp;rsquo;ll need to manage the theme as a separate Git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theme-modification-logichttpsstackjimmycaicomguidemodify-theme&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stack.jimmycai.com/guide/modify-theme&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Theme Modification Logic&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have a solid understanding of the foundational concepts of modularization, customizing themes becomes much simpler. Hugo themes are currently assembled from multiple different modules. To modify one module, simply locate its corresponding template file and make the changes directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As extracted from the official &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this method, there will be no files under the &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; directory.  To modify a theme, you must copy the file you want to modify into the same directory under the &lt;code&gt;layouts&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, to modify the &lt;code&gt;themes/hugo-theme-stack/layouts/partials/head/custom.html&lt;/code&gt; file, you must copy it to &lt;code&gt;layouts/partials/head/custom.html&lt;/code&gt; and modify it there (copying the code from the theme&amp;rsquo;s repository). The same applies to the &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-template-files&#34;&gt;How to Find Template Files
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;conventional-approach&#34;&gt;Conventional Approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review the source files of the topic, understand its design rationale, identify the corresponding template file, and modify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;brute-force-approach&#34;&gt;Brute Force Approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I‚Äôm not very familiar with frontend code, I sometimes resort to a brute force approach, such as opening the corresponding page directly in the browser, finding the areas I want to modify, and using ‚ÄúInspect Element‚Äù to pinpoint the &lt;code&gt;css name&lt;/code&gt;, then searching the source code for the relevant file, copying it into the site directory, and making changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips&#34;&gt;Tips
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official setup provides a default file for customizing styles. To modify specific areas, we can split them into multiple files and import them using &lt;code&gt;custom.scss&lt;/code&gt;. This approach allows for better management of style files.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/hugo-module-customizing-themes-ideas/image.png&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;90px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consolidated-modifications-6h&#34;&gt;Consolidated Modifications (6h)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs now the first year of &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; coding, and detailed content will not be pasted here for brevity; instead, we&amp;rsquo;ll simply list some of the modifications made to this site, such as adjusting the copy button styles, reconfiguring the code block styles, and &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt; was easily handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall: Global text style, retaining the display style previously used by merging &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;info cn&lt;/code&gt;, which is friendly for Chinese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homepage: Added mouse interaction animation to the right navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homepage: New article summaries added (took quite a while to implement using a clever workaround)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll Bar: Improved the styling of the scroll bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Blocks: Introduced the &lt;code&gt;highlight.js&lt;/code&gt; code highlighting plugin, beautifying the code block styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article Details: Some content is from reprints, with new author information display and original link display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive Pages: Removed the color mask from the category images at the top to display the original image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive Pages: Added a statistical display panel for categorization by year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive Pages: Two-column layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; theme has a high component reuse rate, which also led to the lengthy time taken to add new article summaries to the homepage.  After modifying the corresponding components, changes occurred in the article details page as well, resulting in redundant display of content. The &lt;code&gt;golang template&lt;/code&gt; syntax wasn&amp;rsquo;t very familiar, so it took up quite a bit of time.  Component parameter passing was never resolved, and ultimately, through a clever workaround, a &lt;code&gt;JavaScript&lt;/code&gt; script was independently introduced to the homepage to implement the summary preview by using custom special variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, high component reuse can also be a problem, leading to unintended consequences when modifying one place affecting others. Therefore, when modifying themes, you must pay attention not to disrupt existing logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;comments&#34;&gt;Comments
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guy&amp;rsquo;s modifications are more refined: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.reincarnatey.net/2024/0719-better-waline/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://blog.reincarnatey.net/2024/0719-better-waline/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;del&gt;This site simply enabled the &lt;code&gt;Waline&lt;/code&gt; comment system, as the &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; theme defaults to supporting &lt;code&gt;Waline&lt;/code&gt;. Just configure it in the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommend contacting via email on the homepage, this site does not open the comments section&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Town Brahmin: The ‚ÄúBig Man‚Äù of Small Places</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:02:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, the popular &amp;ldquo;Da Bing&amp;rdquo; (Big Ice) on Douyin (TikTok) has been frequently seen with short video accounts extracted from her live streams. A listener who joined a live call asked: ‚ÄúDa Bing, I want to sell my house in Xi‚Äôan and return home to settle down.‚Äù Da Bing responded: ‚ÄúAt your age, you&amp;rsquo;re in your early thirties; you can&amp;rsquo;t settle down. Your parents are on the path of aging, your children haven‚Äôt started a family or established themselves, and if you return home, you‚Äôll still need to deal with the &lt;em&gt;poren&lt;/em&gt;.‚Äù
Let‚Äôs set aside whether the viewpoint is right or wrong, what does the term ‚Äúporen‚Äù mean?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;township-brahmins-the-big-shots-of-small-places&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Township Brahmins: The ‚ÄúBig Shots‚Äù of Small Places&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many small county towns, people often talk about so-called &amp;ldquo;township brahmins&amp;rdquo;‚Äîthe existence of these individuals seems to be a symbol of local society. They are not necessarily genuine religious figures and do not possess ‚Äúhigh-level‚Äù titles; rather, they are seemingly ordinary but nonetheless influential people. They represent ‚Äúpower, status, and influence‚Äù within that county town, symbolizing a particular class or stratum in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-xiancheng-babao&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an ‚ÄúXiancheng Babao?‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand that ‚ÄúBabao‚Äù originally referred to the highest caste in Indian society, representing wisdom, authority, and spiritual supremacy. In China‚Äôs county towns, the term ‚ÄúXiancheng Babao‚Äù doesn&amp;rsquo;t have such a complex religious background; it‚Äôs more of a metaphor for a social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, an ‚ÄúXiancheng Babao‚Äù can be understood as some ‚Äúcultural authorities‚Äù within the county town ‚Äì such as teachers, doctors, well-known merchants, and officials. Although their positions may seem ordinary, in this relatively closed environment, they possessed a comparatively higher social status, or their opinions and actions had influence that could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-the-county-town-brahmin&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is the ‚ÄúCounty Town Brahmin‚Äù?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In county towns, you‚Äôll find figures like this ‚Äì the ‚ÄúBrahmin‚Äù ‚Äì in almost every industry. They might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educators:&lt;/strong&gt; Particularly teachers who have spent decades working in the area, not necessarily graduates of prestigious universities, but who understand how to build credibility through knowledge and are widely respected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Government Officials:&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy county magistrates, section chiefs, etc., who control certain resources and power ‚Äì even if their positions aren‚Äôt high-ranking, their limited scope of authority can make them local ‚ÄúBrahmins.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local ‚ÄúEntrepreneurs‚Äù:&lt;/strong&gt; Some business owners in county towns, though not large in scale, hold a certain amount of wealth and have a voice in the area. They might run one or two well-known small local businesses, wielding considerable influence within the county town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people, while not as prominent as figures in larger cities or high-ranking officials, hold a status almost equivalent to ‚Äúcultural elders‚Äù or ‚Äúcenters of power‚Äù within this small community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-status-of-county-town-brahmins--how-does-it-impact-society&#34;&gt;The Status of ‚ÄúCounty Town Brahmins‚Äù ‚Äì How Does it Impact Society?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the significance of ‚Äúcounty town brahmins,‚Äù we must consider the unique environment of the county town. Here, information flow is slower than in large cities, and social class mobility is relatively fixed. These ‚Äúbrahmins‚Äù often gained prestige, knowledge, and networks through long-term dedication to the local area. They influence various aspects of local politics, economics, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; In small places, especially where education systems are not as developed and people have limited choices, local &amp;ldquo;brahmins&amp;rdquo; subtly shape the cultural atmosphere through knowledge transmission in classrooms, explanations in media, and even moral guidance in social settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concentration of Social Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the limited population and resources of county towns, these ‚Äúbrahmins‚Äù are often one of the primary controllers of local resources. Whether it‚Äôs social welfare, policy implementation, or approval of certain projects, they invariably have an influence. Their power of speech and decision-making allows them to hold a prominent position in local society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Networked Structure of Relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; In a relatively closed small society, interpersonal relationships are crucial. These ‚Äúcounty town brahmins‚Äù build strong social networks to control information flow and resource allocation, enabling them to play a decisive role at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-metaphor-of-the-county-sharma&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Metaphor of the ‚ÄúCounty Sharma‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite often being revered and admired, this position of ‚Äúhigh above‚Äù is not without its issues. In modern society, it‚Äôs easy to see that many ‚ÄúSharmas‚Äù ‚Äì those in county-level positions ‚Äì lack genuine ability and innovative spirit; instead, they maintain their status through hereditary relationships and resource monopolies. With the development of informatization, these ‚ÄúSharmas‚Äô‚Äù power is gradually being broken, and new social mobility is beginning to influence the appearance of small counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, ‚ÄúCounty Sharma‚Äù is a fascinating social phenomenon that reflects the power and cultural structures within local societies. Although their ‚Äúpower‚Äù may not directly threaten national governance, they are undoubtedly key figures within the region. In this era of rapid information flow and accelerating social change, these ‚ÄúSharmas‚Äù in county towns may be facing unprecedented challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this would have happened if we hadn‚Äôt started with curiosity about what a ‚Äòpurohito‚Äô was, and then tossed it to &lt;code&gt;kimi&lt;/code&gt;. The result was surprisingly funny ‚Äì I could see the web interface already pulling up search results, but suddenly they were unable to be displayed as related content. Then I wondered, did this word have some special significance? So I threw it at &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt;, and that&amp;rsquo;s how this article came about.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linux backend services handling large volumes of string data ‚Äì performance is slow.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-backend-slow-string-processing/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:42:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-backend-slow-string-processing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the history of C++ development projects, we utilized a custom protocol for communication, which employed a two-dimensional array pattern. When processing large volumes of data, the protocol required iterating through the arrays and performing serialization operations to generate logs. Due to its low efficiency, this resulted in noticeable lag or stuttering within the system under heavy load, as reported by the business departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-identification&#34;&gt;Problem Identification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When troubleshooting the issue, we first performed a performance analysis of the system and discovered that CPU utilization increased significantly when processing large amounts of data, and system response times became longer. By analyzing the system logs, we identified numerous serialization operations, which were inefficient when handling two-dimensional arrays, leading to a decline in system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool captured thread information for the service, pinpointing that the log threads spent most of their time processing string concatenation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is today‚Äôs focus: different accumulation methods have significant efficiency differences. Historically, the code used the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator, which frequently creates temporary objects and is very inefficient. You know it&amp;rsquo;s bad, but you don&amp;rsquo;t know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; bad it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;demo-verification&#34;&gt;Demo Verification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the project code, we extracted the business logic and wrote a simple demo to verify the efficiency issues of string concatenation. We compiled and ran it in &lt;code&gt;Release&lt;/code&gt; mode using the &lt;code&gt;vs2022&lt;/code&gt; compiler under &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;gcc8.5&lt;/code&gt; compiler under &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt;, comparing the efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-point-explanation&#34;&gt;Key Point Explanation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project utilized Method Four, and before obtaining test data, readers were encouraged to consider which method was most efficient and which was least efficient. I was quite surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 1 (&lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; Concatenation)&lt;/strong&gt;: Directly concatenates each field using &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; into a string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 2 (&lt;code&gt;std::ostringstream&lt;/code&gt; Concatenation)&lt;/strong&gt;: Uses a stream (&lt;code&gt;std::ostringstream&lt;/code&gt;) to concatenate fields, which is more efficient, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 3 (Pre-allocated Memory &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; Concatenation)&lt;/strong&gt;: Pre-allocates enough memory for the string using &lt;code&gt;reserve&lt;/code&gt;, reducing the overhead of memory reallocation and improving performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 4 (&lt;code&gt;bodys = bodys + body + &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;: Creates a new temporary string object each time it concatenates, leading to decreased performance, particularly when dealing with large-scale concatenation due to repeated memory allocation and copying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to the results, we can see that the project inadvertently selected the least efficient method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the optimization efficiency of different platforms and compilers. Microsoft‚Äôs &lt;code&gt;visual studio&lt;/code&gt; consistently performs excellently in terms of string optimization, while the &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; compiler has somewhat lower optimization efficiency in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running the code on different machines, direct comparison between the two datasets is meaningless; instead, we can compare the differences between the various concatenation methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>C&#43;&#43; Lambda Expression Parameter Lifetimes</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-lambda-parameter-lifetime/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:23:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-lambda-parameter-lifetime/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In C++, lambda expressions are a convenient way to create anonymous functions that can capture external variables and use them within their bodies. This makes lambdas a flexible programming tool. However, the lifetime of parameters in a lambda expression is an aspect that requires careful attention, especially when capturing and passing parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-lambda-expression-parameter-lifetime&#34;&gt;1. Lambda Expression Parameter Lifetime
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lifetime of parameters in a lambda expression is typically the same as that of other C++ functions. Parameters exist while the function is being called, and their lifetime ends when the function call terminates. However, due to the possibility of lambdas capturing external variables, the parameter&amp;rsquo;s lifetime is also affected by how it‚Äôs captured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-capturing-the-relationship-with-parameter-lifecycles&#34;&gt;2. Capturing the Relationship with Parameter Lifecycles
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;21-capturing-external-variables&#34;&gt;2.1 Capturing External Variables
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;C++ lambda expressions allow capturing external variables in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture by Value:&lt;/strong&gt; When capturing by value, the value of the external variable is copied into the lambda&amp;rsquo;s internal scope. The lifetime of this copy is controlled by the lambda‚Äôs own lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture by Reference:&lt;/strong&gt; When capturing by reference, a reference to the external variable is retained. The lambda‚Äôs reference points to the original external variable, and its lifetime depends on the external variable‚Äôs lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;int x = 10;
auto lambda_by_value = [x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };  // Captures a copy of x
auto lambda_by_reference = [&amp;amp;x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };  // Captures a reference to x

lambda_by_value();  // Prints 10
lambda_by_reference();  // Prints 10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For captured variables, the lifetimes are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture by Value:&lt;/strong&gt; When capturing, the external variable‚Äôs value is copied into the lambda, and the copy is destroyed when the lambda‚Äôs lifetime ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture by Reference:&lt;/strong&gt; The lambda holds a reference to the external variable; &lt;strong&gt;the external variable must be valid at the time the lambda is used, or undefined behavior results.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;22-lambda-parameters&#34;&gt;2.2 Lambda Parameters
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lambda parameters are similar to regular function parameters; their lifetime is limited to the lambda function body. That is, lambda parameters are created when the lambda is called and their lifetime ends when the lambda call finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;auto lambda = [](int a, int b) {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; a + b &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
};
lambda(5, 10);  // a and b are the parameters of the lambda here
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are the parameters of the lambda expression, they are created when the lambda is called and destroyed after the lambda executes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-lifecycle-issues-when-capturing-external-variables&#34;&gt;3. Lifecycle Issues When Capturing External Variables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;31-whether-captured-variables-can-be-effective-outside-lambda&#34;&gt;3.1 Whether Captured Variables Can Be Effective Outside Lambda
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value Capture&lt;/strong&gt;: Even if the external variable is destroyed after the lambda call, the lambda internally still holds a copy of the external variable. Therefore, the copy within the lambda can be safely used even if the external variable no longer exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;int x = 10;
auto lambda = [x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };
x = 20;  // x is modified after the lambda call
lambda();  // Prints 10, captures a copy of x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference Capture&lt;/strong&gt;: If the external variable is captured by reference, the lambda&amp;rsquo;s access to this reference depends on the lifetime of the external variable. If the external variable is destroyed before the lambda executes, a dangling reference issue will occur, leading to undefined behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;int x = 10;
auto lambda = [&amp;amp;x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };
x = 20;  // x is modified before the lambda call
lambda();  // Prints 20, captures a reference to x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to ensure that the external variable is valid when the lambda executes if the execution order of the lambda is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Win11 Logitech G431 Headset Driver Installation</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 07:20:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Picking up where we left off, I discovered that GitHub had an update, which was a little exciting. The customer service team said the issue with the driver not loading properly was resolved. However, after going through all of this ‚Äì reinstalling and uninstalling ‚Äì it still wasn‚Äôt working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing to contact customer service to inquire about a resolution, I was informed that an engineer could provide remote assistance. However, the engineer‚Äôs working hours coincided exactly with my own, leaving me with no option but to abandon the effort. Reviewing the documentation from the previous troubleshooting issue, I decided to attempt a manual driver installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obtaining-driver-installation-packages&#34;&gt;Obtaining Driver Installation Packages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logitech does not provide separate driver installation packages for devices. How can I obtain the driver files?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with the system image package left over from the previous system reinstallation, we can reinstall the system once in a local virtual machine, and then deploy a clean copy of Ghub in the pure system, inserting the headset device into the virtual machine to find the driver path and copy it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevant paths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\ProgramData\LGHUB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\logi_audio.inf_amd64_010b035044e24be4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;device-manager&#34;&gt;Device Manager
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus is on how to find the second path ‚Äì let‚Äôs first briefly outline how to manually manage driver files in a Windows 11 system. This content &lt;strong&gt;is identified using the method of controlling variables by repeatedly plugging and unplugging devices, analyzing device information within Device Manager inside a virtual machine, and identifying three drivers that need to be handled for headphones.&lt;/strong&gt; Two of these drivers are system-provided, while one is provided by Logitech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/20240605073331.png&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;47&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;114px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second driver shown in the image, it‚Äôs provided by Logitech.  Let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the current driver program for the device and then search all driver paths within the virtual machine. Of course, you first need to find files starting with ‚Äúlogi,‚Äù then compare the files, which will help you pinpoint the driver folder. Copying the entire folder gives you the driver installation package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/20240605073933.png&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;146&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;352px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-the-driver&#34;&gt;Installing the Driver
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the device manager interface, click: Update driver, then click: Browse my computer to find drivers, and you‚Äôll arrive at the following interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/20240605074130.png&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;138&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;332px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when you open it, you&amp;rsquo;ll only see one driver ‚Äì the standard USB driver. Select &amp;ldquo;Install from disk&amp;rdquo; and the path is the folder we copied earlier. After installation, you‚Äôll be able to add Logitech-specific drivers in the dropdown list. Switch the device driver to the newly installed driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;human-anatomy-device-driven&#34;&gt;Human Anatomy Device-Driven
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These driver files are provided by the system. You only need to check if there is an exclamation mark preceding the device driver name. If there is, enter the Driver Selection interface, randomly switch to a different type of driver, and then revert it back to restore normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;completed&#34;&gt;Completed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microphone volume on the headphones has been restored to normal, and the familiar in-ear functionality has returned.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the C drive on my desktop computer, which I use for development, had run out of space. I specially took out a 256GB semi-retired solid state hard drive and used it as the C drive. Unfortunately, I kept messing around with it. Since moving to Shanghai, I‚Äôve been busy with various things, and last week I finally took some time to reinstall the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system reinstallation went smoothly, and installing everyday software and deploying development environments didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter any problems. A few days later, I planned to relax and play a few games when I realized that the drivers for my mouse and headphones hadn‚Äôt been installed. Both devices are from Logitech, so I downloaded the GHUB software, which can automatically identify hardware and install drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an unexpected problem occurred. The mouse driver installed successfully, but the headphone driver kept displaying ‚ÄúLoading‚Ä¶‚Äù. I suspected that the latest version of Windows 11 might be incompatible with Logitech‚Äôs drivers, causing the installation to fail. So, I started searching for information and trying to manually install the drivers, but the problem remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s briefly explain what the functions of these two devices‚Äô drivers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mouse driver is mainly used to adjust mouse movement speed and other functions. I rarely use macro functions; I just need to restore previously remembered parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The headphone driver primarily focuses on the headset function, which is very useful during team voice chats, allowing me to hear my own voice. Although there‚Äôs a similar listening function in the system&amp;rsquo;s microphone settings, it doesn‚Äôt perform as well as the driver implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite repeatedly trying, the headphone driver always failed to load properly. Today, I finally thought of contacting customer support to inquire about the situation and see if there were any solutions. The customer service representative told me that their servers had recently experienced an issue, causing driver downloads to be abnormal. They are currently working on resolving the problem, asking me not to panic, and promising a solution with the next update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the headphone driver issue hasn‚Äôt been resolved yet, at least I now know the cause, and I hope the problem can be solved as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cancellation-of-national-level-first-and-second-tier-commercial-personal-housing-loan-interest-rate-policy-lower-bounds&#34;&gt;Cancellation of National-Level First and Second-Tier Commercial Personal Housing Loan Interest Rate Policy Lower Bounds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Headquarters of the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, branches of the People‚Äôs Bank of China in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and planned cities; branches of all state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and all joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to implement the decision deployment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, adapt to the new supply and demand relationship in China‚Äôs real estate market and the new expectations of people for high-quality housing, and promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, the following matters regarding adjustments to commercial personal housing loan interest rate policies are hereby notified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. The lower bounds of interest rates on commercial personal housing loans for first-tier and second-tier housing nationwide are cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;II. Branches of the People‚Äôs Bank of China at provincial levels will, in accordance with the principle of tailoring measures to local conditions, guide provincial market interest rate pricing self-regulatory mechanisms to determine independently whether to set lower bounds on commercial personal housing loan interest rates and their respective levels (if any), based on the real estate market situation within each jurisdiction and local government regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;III. Financial institutions in the banking industry shall reasonably determine the specific interest rate level for each loan, taking into account the interest rate limits determined by provincial market interest rate pricing self-regulatory mechanisms (if any) and factors such as the operating conditions of the institution and its customer risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-personal-housing-mortgage-loan-interest-rates-by-025-percentage-points&#34;&gt;Reducing Personal Housing Mortgage Loan Interest Rates by 0.25 Percentage Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, Shanghai Headquarters, branches of the People‚Äôs Bank of China in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and planned special-purpose cities; policy banks, state commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People‚Äôs Bank of China has decided to reduce personal housing mortgage loan interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, effective May 18, 2024. The interest rates for first-time and second-home personal housing mortgage loans with a term of less than 5 years (including 5 years) will be adjusted to 2.35% and 2.85%, respectively.  The interest rates for first-time and second-home personal housing mortgage loans with a term of less than 5 years (including 5 years) will also be no lower than 2.775% and 3.325%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;down-payment-ratio-adjusted-to-no-less-than-15&#34;&gt;Down Payment Ratio Adjusted to No Less Than 15%
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, Shanghai Headquarters, branches of the People‚Äôs Bank of China in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and planned unitary cities; the Regulatory Bureau of the National Financial Supervision and Administration; all state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and all joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to implement the decision-making deployment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, adapt to the new supply and demand relationship in China‚Äôs real estate market and the new expectations of people for high-quality housing, and promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, the following matters regarding personal mortgage loans are hereby notified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For residential households purchasing commercial first-time home purchases, the minimum down payment ratio for commercial personal mortgages on first-time home purchases will be adjusted to no less than 15%, and the minimum down payment ratio for commercial personal mortgages on second-time home purchases will be adjusted to no less than 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, the branches of the People‚Äôs Bank of China at each provincial level, and theÊ¥æÂá∫Êú∫ÊûÑ (outposts) of the National Financial Supervision and Administration will, according to the control requirements of local governments, independently determine the minimum down payment ratio limits for first-time and second-time home purchases in various cities based on a principle of tailoring policies to local conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-central-bank-will-establish-a-30-billion-yuan-guarantee-housing-re-loan&#34;&gt;The Central Bank Will Establish a 30 Billion Yuan Guarantee Housing Re-Loan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 4:00 PM, representatives from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the People‚Äôs Bank of China, and the National Financial Supervision and Administration Commission gathered at a routine policy briefing by the State Council to introduce measures to effectively ensure contract fulfillment (‰øù‰∫§Êàø).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Vice Governor Tao Ling announced that the central bank will establish a 30 billion yuan guarantee housing re-loan facility to support local state-owned enterprises in purchasing completed but unsold commercial properties at reasonable prices for use as self-built or rental-based affordable housing. This is expected to drive an additional 50 billion yuan in bank loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the People‚Äôs Bank of China, the guarantee housing re-loan term can be extended up to four times annually, with a rate of 1.75%, aimed at 21 nationwide banks. It incentivizes banks to lend to local state-owned enterprises selected by city governments to purchase completed but unsold commercial properties for use as affordable housing. The purchased properties are strictly limited to those commercially available properties built by real estate developers that have not yet been sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding this policy, the central bank will soon issue the &lt;em&gt;Notice on Measures Concerning the Establishment of the Guarantee Housing Re-Loan Facility&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Balancing Bank Marketing Strategies with the Art of Personal Financial Management</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 01:33:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the renovation project at home has led to a surge in daily expenses. I‚Äôve also been using credit cards, paying them off within the billing cycle, although I have enough cash on hand, I prefer to keep it in money funds to earn some additional interest income. Furthermore, to ensure financial stability, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up automatic payment functionality so that my credit card bills can be paid promptly upon maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-status-deposits-increase-loans-decrease&#34;&gt;Bank Status: Deposits Increase, Loans Decrease
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst increasing economic uncertainty, people are more inclined to save rather than consume or invest. This has led to an increase in bank deposits, but it also means banks have to pay higher interest rates to depositors. Conversely, due to reduced consumer and investment activity, loan demand has decreased, making it difficult for banks to generate interest income through lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attract and retain customers, banks are forced to offer more competitive deposit rates, further compressing the bank‚Äôs net interest margin. Simultaneously, in order to stimulate economic growth and consumption, central banks may implement policies of lowering benchmark interest rates, which will also impact bank loan rates and consequently affect their profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;banking-marketing-strategies-cultivating-user-habits&#34;&gt;Banking Marketing Strategies: Cultivating User Habits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The due date is almost here. First, the Bank of Communications contacted me, offering a one-year free installment payment service with no interest charges. Shortly after, China Merchants Bank also provided installment interest discounts of 2.5% off, equivalent to an annualized interest rate of 1.9%. Faced with these offers, I chose to accept installment services from both banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that banks are truly willing to invest heavily in cultivating user habits. According to the bank‚Äôs definition of ‚Äúflow,‚Äù I should be a premium customer. In the current context of difficulty for banks in lending and deploying funds, by fostering my installment awareness, the bank is actually preparing for potential liquidity difficulties that may arise from me in the future, at which point they can earn more interest income from me. After all, as we know, interest rates on credit card bill analysis are not low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks use free installment services and low-interest installment offers to not only increase the frequency and amount of credit card usage but also to establish a positive image in the minds of users. This shift in strategy reflects the bank‚Äôs rapid response to market changes and its deep understanding of customer needs. In this way, the bank not only solves the problem of difficulty in lending and deploying funds, but also lays the groundwork for future profits ‚Äì &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s not just about making money today; looking ahead is key to long-term success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-personal-financial-management&#34;&gt;The Importance of Personal Financial Management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the appealing offers of installment financing from banks, as users, we should recognize the risks associated with over-reliance on credit card installments. We should carefully consider our repayment ability and future financial needs to avoid falling into long-term debt traps due to short-term financial convenience. Key to personal financial management is balancing current needs with future planning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The multifaceted nature of gaming: the intersection of psychological development and social entertainment.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 15:07:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today‚Äôs digital age, games have evolved far beyond a simple form of entertainment and become an integral part of people&amp;rsquo;s daily lives. From a psychological perspective, games play different roles in the mental development of individuals across various age groups, while also being closely intertwined with social and recreational activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-state&#34;&gt;Mental State
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people are in the stage of self-exploration and identity formation. &lt;strong&gt;Games provide them with a low-cost environment to try and explore.&lt;/strong&gt; Through games, they can experiment with different roles and lifestyles, satisfying their curiosity and desire for exploration. As they grow older, individuals‚Äô interests and values gradually stabilize, and games may no longer align with their life goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes&#34;&gt;Social Attributes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the game has also become a part of social activities, particularly for young people. They make friends and build social networks through games, making games a bridge for socialization. However, as people age, their social circles gradually stabilize, and social needs may be met through more mature ways, leading to a relative reduction in the role of games in socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes-bringing-a-sister&#34;&gt;Social Attributes: Bringing a Sister
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within China, due to a lack of education regarding romantic relationships, parents often simply expect you to study diligently and then immediately focus on finding a partner after graduation. This phenomenon is quite common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of busy studies, work, or a lack of social skills, individuals are unable to establish stable emotional relationships in real life, leading to feelings of loneliness and a desire for attention. &lt;strong&gt;The ‚Äúbringing a sister‚Äù behavior within games provides them with an outlet to release this craving.&lt;/strong&gt; By helping and protecting female players, they can experience being needed and valued, achieving emotional satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the interactive rules within games are clearly defined, and the environment is controllable, offering a sense of certainty and security compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real life, reducing fear of the uncertainties in real-life interactions. However, long-term reliance on virtual gratification within games can potentially impact their ability to build and maintain healthy emotional relationships in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-world-pressure&#34;&gt;Real-World Pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games provide a virtual world where players can temporarily escape the pressures, challenges, or unpleasant emotions of real life. Particularly for young people facing academic pressure, family issues, or interpersonal relationship challenges, games may become a way to seek comfort and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are typically designed to give players a sense of accomplishment and recognition when completing tasks, leveling up, or defeating opponents. Young people may become addicted to games because they can experience a feeling of being appreciated and recognized within them ‚Äì a feeling that may be lacking in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dislike-playing-after-getting-older&#34;&gt;Dislike Playing After Getting Older
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young, individuals face relatively fewer social responsibilities and pressures, allowing them more time and energy to invest in gaming. As they enter the workforce or start families and other social responsibilities increase, time and energy become more valuable, and games may be seen as a drain on resources rather than a prioritized leisure activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, their cognitive abilities and interests also change. They might have been interested in fast-paced, visually stunning games when younger, but with increased experience, they may prefer strategy games, those with strong storylines, or games with greater depth. If the market doesn‚Äôt meet these changing needs, interest naturally diminishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Renminbi exchange rate has experienced significant fluctuations, breaking above 7.26.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/renminbi-exchange-rate-volatility/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 00:31:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/renminbi-exchange-rate-volatility/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The fluctuations in the Renminbi exchange rate and the decline in the A-share market may be related to the dynamics of global central banks, the unexpected interest rate cut by the Swiss Central Bank, the performance of U.S. economic data, and adjustments in market expectations regarding inflation and interest rate cuts. These factors jointly acted on the foreign exchange market and stock market, leading to fluctuations in the Renminbi and the decline in the A-share market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the provided link content, on March 22, 2024, the Renminbi experienced significant volatility. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dollar/Offshore RMB Exchange Rate Breaks Through:&lt;/strong&gt; At opening, the Renminbi weakened, with the dollar-offshore RMB rising to a high of 7.24926 and the on-shore RMB rising to a high of 7.22360, both breaking new highs since November 17, 2023. As of the time of release by Lianhe Chat, the dollar-offshore RMB broke through the 7.26 mark, with the lowest reported at 7.2639 and the trend remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central Bank Mid-Exchange Rate Adjustment:&lt;/strong&gt; On March 22nd, the central bank announced the Renminbi‚Äôs midpoint exchange rate against the dollar at 7.1004, a devaluation of 62 basis points, with the adjustment magnitude expanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A-Share Market Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; Affected by various factors, the three major A-share indices opened low and continued to fall, with declines exceeding 1% overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons for Volatility in the Foreign Exchange Market:&lt;/strong&gt; A senior foreign exchange trader from a Hong Kong investment institution stated that the volatility in the foreign exchange market was mainly due to the unexpected interest rate cut by the Swiss Central Bank boosting the dollar, coupled with strong U.S. economic data and the potential persistence of inflation delaying interest rate cuts, leading to an increase in the Dollar Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Central Bank Dynamics:&lt;/strong&gt; This week is the ‚ÄúSuper Central Bank Week‚Äù for global markets, with the central banks of the United States, Japan, Britain, Australia, and other countries all announcing interest rate decisions this week. The Swiss Central Bank unexpectedly announced a cut in interest rates, becoming the first G10 currency central bank to cut rates since the outbreak of the pandemic, which broke the market balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecast for Renminbi Trend:&lt;/strong&gt; Zhou Miaohua, researcher at Light Industry Bank‚Äôs Financial Market Department, stated that despite some fluctuations in the Renminbi recently, the overall magnitude is significantly smaller than that of major currencies such as the dollar, and short-term volatility will not change the RMB&amp;rsquo;s trend of steady appreciation throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Python Dictionary Storage of Custom Objects: The Importance of References vs. Deep Copies</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/python-dictionary-custom-objects-reference-vs-deepcopy/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 01:08:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/python-dictionary-custom-objects-reference-vs-deepcopy/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Python programming, a dictionary is a very powerful data structure that allows us to associate key-value pairs and efficiently search and manipulate these data. When we try to store custom objects in a dictionary, we often encounter a crucial concept: In Python, object assignment is actually reference assignment, not a deep copy of the object itself. This means that when you put a custom object into a dictionary, the dictionary stores a reference to that object, rather than a brand new copy of the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-example-of-storing-custom-objects&#34;&gt;Basic Example of Storing Custom Objects
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a simple &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Create a Person object
p1 = Person(&amp;quot;Alice&amp;quot;, 30)

# Store the object in a dictionary
people_dict = {}
people_dict[&amp;quot;alice&amp;quot;] = p1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the &lt;code&gt;people_dict&lt;/code&gt; dictionary now contains an item with a key &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;alice&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and its value is a reference to the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; type object &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt;. If we modify the properties of this object:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;p1.age = 31
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then when accessing this object through the dictionary, we will find that its age has also been updated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;print(people_dict[&amp;quot;alice&amp;quot;].age)  # Output: 31
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the dictionary stores references to &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; objects rather than independent copies of them. It stores a reference to the same memory address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deep-copy-vs-shallow-copy&#34;&gt;Deep Copy vs. Shallow Copy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This referencing behavior can lead to unexpected results when dealing with nested data structures or custom objects. For example, if a custom object contains mutable attributes (such as lists or another custom object), directly storing such an object in a dictionary and modifying it will affect the object obtained through the dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;class Address:
    def __init__(self, street, city):
        self.street = street
        self.city = city

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age, address):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.address = address

address = Address(&amp;quot;Main St.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Springfield&amp;quot;)
p1 = Person(&amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;, 40, address)
people_dict[&amp;quot;bob&amp;quot;] = p1

# Modify the original address object
address.city = &amp;quot;Shelbyville&amp;quot;

# The person in the dictionary&#39;s address also changed
print(people_dict[&amp;quot;bob&amp;quot;].address.city)  # Output: Shelbyville
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution: Deep Copy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid problems caused by shared state, we sometimes need to ensure that the dictionary stores a complete copy of the object, rather than a reference to it. Python provides the &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; module&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; function to achieve this goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import copy

# Use deep copy to store objects
people_dict[&amp;quot;bob_deepcopy&amp;quot;] = copy.deepcopy(p1)

# Now even if you modify the original address object, the deep copied object is not affected
address.city = &amp;quot;Capital City&amp;quot;
print(people_dict[&amp;quot;bob&amp;quot;].address.city)  # Output: Capital City
print(people_dict[&amp;quot;bob_deepcopy&amp;quot;].address.city)  # Output: Shelbyville
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, when using dictionaries to store custom objects in Python, be sure to pay attention to the fact that they default to storing object references. For situations where you need to maintain independent states, use &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; to perform a deep copy to avoid unexpected data changes due to shared referencing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;315 actually did not report on ‚Äúchicken mud,‚Äù and this issue itself has been confusing the official exposure of CCTV‚Äôs 3¬∑15 Gala with other food safety hotspots that occurred concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zhihu-answer-journalismhttpswwwzhihucomquestion648967411answer3433834122&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zhihu.com/question/648967411/answer/3433834122&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zhihu Answer: Journalism&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 315 evening event mentioned nine manufacturers, and none of them included potato starch (daoniansan). Now, the major brands that were nominated have lost all heat, while this potato starch ‚Äì which is a national staple (found on almost every street food corner across China with a large number of stalls, likely the most prevalent) ‚Äì has been brought out to argue and it feels like potato starch is being entirely scapegoated. I‚Äôve looked at online news sources; CCTV released a report on ham on 3.15, listing only a few manufacturers&amp;rsquo; ingredients, and none of those manufacturers were primarily producers of potato starch. There was nothing obviously wrong with their ingredients, and then this reporter used information from an employee at one factory who said they sometimes use chicken bone meal to substitute for meat ‚Äì something that was rumored ‚Äì and she went to inquire on Taobao about pet food suppliers selling chicken bone meal: ‚ÄúCan people eat it?‚Äù This isn‚Äôt a stupid question, is it? They dare to sell it to pets? Then rumors spread that potato starch contained chicken bone meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, many factories are likely to close down, and tens of thousands of small street vendors across the country face the situation of having goods unsold and no business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-life-on-earth&#34;&gt;Real Life on Earth
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Xiaoxiang Morning News reports on March 17th, the day after the ‚Äústuck starch tube collapse‚Äù incident in Sanmenxia, Henan, an elderly woman set up a stall selling starch tubes two days later, but after two hours, she still didn‚Äôt attract any customers and ultimately quietly ate the starch tubes herself. The photographer said that he himself usually eats four or five starch tubes at once, but after learning that the starch tubes contained chicken bone mud, he refused to eat them. That day, out of curiosity about whether anyone would still buy her sausages after they were exposed, he saw that the vendor hadn‚Äôt sold a single tube in two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aunt didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about the starch tube incident; she only knew that suddenly no one was buying her grilled sausages today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elderly woman was right; she was just trying to make a living, and the elderly woman didn‚Äôt even know if the product had any problems or whether it was qualified, nor did she know what bone mud was. She didn&amp;rsquo;t know about the internet; she was simply a bottom-level person finding ways to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starch tubes collapsed, but the bill was paid by one after another of bottom-level vendors. It‚Äôs a painful process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;Zhihu Answer: Regulatory Issues&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, during an afternoon, my colleague who was working in Beijing and I went to have lunch. We passed by a small stall selling sausages and sizzling beef skewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blurted out, ‚ÄúWith all this black technology starch sausage and sizzling beef, are people even going to eat it?‚Äù Because in my view, the last time I ate a starch-based ham sausage was probably about fifteen years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague hesitated and then said tactfully, &amp;ldquo;Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve been living in a big city. Actually, in our hometown, pickled cabbage, instant noodles, and ham sausages are everyday staples.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhen I was in school, my dad would only let me have a sausage on the road if I got full marks. It wasn‚Äôt because they were unhygienic; sausages simply cost 1.5 yuan, enough to buy two pounds of vegetables.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe way we call instant noodles, carbonated drinks, and spicy strips ‚Äòjunk food‚Äô ‚Äì I only learned about that after coming to Beijing for school.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized how arrogant my casual words had been and stopped talking. But this incident left a deep impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this is the daily life of most Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lives don&amp;rsquo;t include fancy ‚ÄúMediterranean diets,‚Äù ‚Äúgreen organic vegetables,‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-GMO soybeans.‚Äù They only care about whether they can buy some cheap and delicious vegetables, meat, and snacks, and enjoy the few moments of happiness their families have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They‚Äôre curious about what ingredients make up the things on shelves, whether they might harm their health, and if there are any strange chemical components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simply not something they should be concerned with or understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They simply believe that if there‚Äôs a problem, someone should be in charge, and it shouldn‚Äôt appear on the shelves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after watching a 315 episode, we realized that wasn‚Äôt the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-tech modifications were found in electronic scales and gasoline pumps, requiring YouTubers to take videos risking beatings to expose them, allowing regulators to ‚Äúsuddenly realize‚Äù and investigate;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pork belly and starch sausages sold on live streams and small stalls turned out to be made with rotten meat and bone meal, requiring CCTV reporters to go undercover and film before anyone verified the source and tracked it down;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúHealth wines‚Äù heavily promoted on television and airport advertisements needed someone to expose their entire backstory through videos before they were urgently removed overnight, disappearing from the public‚Äôs sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a year&amp;rsquo;s 315 event, every six or seven products are randomly pulled ‚Äì is that enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you find those who have already eaten or bought them?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Want your home network to be lightning fast? The key is understanding cable selection, optical terminals (ONTs), and router configuration, as well as those seemingly insignificant details. This blog post will guide you through easily learning how to build a gigabit network using six types of cables, and how to ensure your network speed isn&amp;rsquo;t restricted by simple device checks and configurations. Let‚Äôs explore together and make your home network fly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-an-in-depth-analysis-of-network-transmission-media&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: An In-Depth Analysis of Network Transmission Media
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When discussing achieving gigabit network access, the carrier that supports high-speed information transmission ‚Äì cables ‚Äì plays a crucial role. Below we will provide detailed interpretations of Cat5, Cat6, and Cat7 cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-five-category-cables-cat5&#34;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Five-Category Cables (CAT5)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAT5 cables, also known as CAT5, are an earlier and more widely adopted type of twisted pair cable. Each pair of wire pairs is designed with a precise helical structure to reduce crosstalk. It‚Äôs primarily used for 10/100Mbps Fast Ethernet, with a maximum transmission frequency of approximately 100MHz. While it was once widely applied, CAT5 cables cannot meet current demands for gigabit and even higher speeds due to physical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-six-category-cables-cat6&#34;&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Six-Category Cables (CAT6)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the development of technology, six-category cables have emerged. Compared to five-category cables, six-cable materials adopted stricter manufacturing standards and more advanced structural designs, significantly improving anti-interference capability and transmission efficiency, supporting data transfer rates up to 1Gbps, and with a transmission distance of up to 100 meters under ideal conditions, which perfectly meets the access requirements of Gigabit networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-seven-category-cables-cat7&#34;&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Seven-Category Cables (CAT7)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven-category cables represent the current cutting edge of twisted pair cabling technology. It not only offers a significant leap in transmission rates, theoretically supporting speeds up to 10Gbps, but also incorporates a complete shielding system, including shielding between each pair and overall external shielding, which greatly reduces external electromagnetic interference and near-end crosstalk, ensuring data transmission stability and accuracy. However, CAT7 cables are primarily used for future 10 Gigabit Ethernet or specific high-requirement scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When setting up a gigabit home network environment, choosing six-category cables is the most economical and efficient choice to fully unleash the potential of the gigabit fiber optic.  Furthermore, ensuring that all cabling materials meet quality standards and strictly adhering to standard wiring practices are also crucial elements in guaranteeing network performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-two-deep-dive-into-core-network-devices--the-impact-of-optical-cat-pon-and-router-lan-port-bandwidth&#34;&gt;Chapter Two: Deep Dive into Core Network Devices ‚Äì The Impact of Optical Cat (PON) and Router LAN Port Bandwidth
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-importance-of-optical-cat-ont-and-its-lan-port-bandwidth&#34;&gt;The Importance of Optical Cat (ONT) and its LAN Port Bandwidth
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Optical Cat, or Optical Network Terminal (ONT), is the core device for home broadband access. Its function is to convert optical signals from fiber optic cables into digital signals for use by home network devices. For users with gigabit fiber connections, whether the ONT supports gigabit transmission is particularly important. If the ONT‚Äôs WAN port only supports 100 Mbps, even if the incoming fiber rate is high, it will be limited to 100 Mbps due to this bottleneck. Similarly, the ONT‚Äôs LAN port also needs to have a gigabit output capability; otherwise, routers or other devices connected to it cannot obtain the true gigabit rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-role-of-bandwidth-on-router-lan-ports&#34;&gt;The Role of Bandwidth on Router LAN Ports
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The router‚Äôs LAN ports are responsible for distributing the data received to various terminal devices. When a router&amp;rsquo;s LAN port is only 100 Mbps, even if other devices are configured well, it can only achieve 100 Mbps local network communication. Therefore, when building a Gigabit home network, it‚Äôs crucial to ensure that the router‚Äôs WAN port can receive 1 Gbps data and that the LAN ports also provide data output capabilities at the Gigabit level, allowing all smart devices in your home to enjoy the smooth experience brought by high-speed networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that some older or low-end routers may have a LAN port rate auto-negotiation mechanism, which means that even if the router itself supports 1 Gbps, it might be downgraded to 100 Mbps mode due to cable issues, device compatibility, and other factors. Therefore, correctly configuring router parameters, enabling forced Gigabit mode, and pairing it with a Gigabit switch or direct connection devices are key steps in achieving a full Gigabit network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After upgrading to gigabit fiber optic, be sure to check and replace them with a gigabit optical gateway and a gigabit router, ensuring that all device interfaces reach the Gigabit level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-three-the-hidden-mystery--how-a-broken-subline-impacts-gigabit-network-speed&#34;&gt;Chapter Three: The Hidden Mystery ‚Äì How a Broken Subline Impacts Gigabit Network Speed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;line-fault-and-network-performance-degradation&#34;&gt;Line Fault and Network Performance Degradation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the speed tests, the network consistently maintained a connection without any apparent disconnects. As it was a newly deployed broadband for residential customers, the distribution box was cluttered with equipment, and the technician frequently adjusted the fiber optic ONT‚Äôs cabling and power adapter placements. This occasionally resulted in speed test results reaching gigabit speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the previous analysis, we had already investigated and ruled out network cable types and ONT LAN port speeds. Ultimately, the culprit was discovered to be a brown sub-cable within the network cable that had fractured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of the break: When the technician installed the crystal head, he applied a little too much force, causing one of the sub-cables to snap in half. It wasn‚Äôt completely severed, and subsequent adjustments to the ONT position caused it to eventually break off entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;six-category-cable-lines-function-analysis&#34;&gt;Six Category Cable Lines Function Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six category cables adhere to the TIA/EIA-568-B standard and contain eight twisted pairs of wires, color-coded as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Orange / Orange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Green / Green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Blue / Blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Brown / Brown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the standard of Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-T), these eight lines consist of four pairs working simultaneously, with the following division of labor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The White Orange and Orange pair of wires (1&amp;amp;2) is used for transmitting data (Tx+/-);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The White Green and Green pair of wires (3&amp;amp;6) is used for receiving data (Rx+/-);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The White Blue and Blue pair of wires (4&amp;amp;5) and the White Brown and Brown pair of wires (7&amp;amp;8) were not originally primary in Gigabit Ethernet, but may be enabled in certain advanced applications (such as some PoE power delivery or future technology expansions). In traditional 100 Mbps networks, only four lines ‚Äì 1, 2, 3, and 6 ‚Äì could be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;impact-of-breakaway-pairs-on-network-speed&#34;&gt;Impact of Breakaway Pairs on Network Speed
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above scenarios, if a brown sub-cable (i.e., a brown or brown-white wire) breaks, theoretically it will cause speed degradation in gigabit networks, as gigabit networks require all four pairs of wires to transmit bidirectionally simultaneously to achieve full speed. However, due to the automatic negotiation function often found in home network devices, when a cable issue is detected, they will revert to a lower operating mode that can still function normally, namely 100 Mbps mode. This explains why even with a broken sub-cable, the network remains connected and operates at 100 Mbps speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, while a broken brown sub-cable does not affect the basic operation of a 100 Mbps network, it can become a key limiting factor for network speed in a gigabit environment. Until thorough diagnostics and repairs are performed, the full potential of a gigabit fiber optic cable cannot be realized. This also reminds us that when encountering similar situations, we should not ignore any potential network infrastructure issues, even seemingly minor faults that do not affect basic connectivity, as they can become hidden obstacles to high-speed network performance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WPF UI Thread Blocking Issues and Solutions</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wpf-ui-thread-and-freezing-solutions/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 07:12:21 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wpf-ui-thread-and-freezing-solutions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When developing desktop applications, particularly when using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework to build rich client applications, properly handling the user interface (UI) thread is crucial for ensuring the application‚Äôs smoothness and responsiveness. The UI thread, also known as the main thread, is the core thread responsible for processing window and control events, layout calculations, and rendering the UI. Any interaction with UI elements should be executed on the UI thread; this is a fundamental principle followed by WPF and most other GUI frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-ui-thread&#34;&gt;What is the UI Thread?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UI thread is created by the operating system when a WPF application starts and initializes the main application window. It‚Äôs the only thread within the application that can directly access and modify the state of UI components. This means all user interactions, such as button clicks, text box input, and window size changes, are processed in this thread context. Furthermore, WPF&amp;rsquo;s dependency property system, data binding mechanism, and layout logic are all synchronized on the UI thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;screen-stuttering-and-its-causes&#34;&gt;Screen Stuttering and Its Causes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the UI thread is heavily occupied or blocked for an extended period, such as when performing time-consuming calculations, loading large amounts of data, database queries, or other I/O-intensive tasks, it becomes unable to promptly respond to user interaction requests. This results in the UI freezing ‚Äì what we commonly refer to as &amp;ldquo;stuttering.&amp;rdquo; In this situation, users will noticeably feel the application&amp;rsquo;s lag and lack of fluidity, and in severe cases, an ‚ÄúApplication Not Responding‚Äù (ANR) warning may appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;two-basic-rules-for-the-ui-thread&#34;&gt;Two Basic Rules for the UI Thread
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid the above scenarios, WPF developers should adhere to the following two key rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not perform time-consuming operations on the UI thread:&lt;/strong&gt; Any operation that could cause the UI thread to block should be moved to a background thread as much as possible to ensure the UI thread can promptly respond to user input and render screen changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not directly update UI elements from non-UI threads:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to WPF‚Äôs security mechanism design, only the UI thread has permission to modify UI elements. Attempting to change UI state directly from another thread will throw an exception. Therefore, even if a background thread completes calculations or data preparation, you must use appropriate cross-thread communication mechanisms to display the results on the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions-asynchronous-programming-and-thread-safe-updates&#34;&gt;Solutions: Asynchronous Programming and Thread-Safe Updates
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To execute time-consuming tasks while maintaining UI fluency, WPF provides various asynchronous programming models and tools to assist developers in achieving this goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispatcher Object:&lt;/strong&gt; The WPF Dispatcher class allows you to schedule work items into the UI thread&amp;rsquo;s task queue for execution. You can use the &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher.Invoke&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher.BeginInvoke&lt;/code&gt; methods to safely update the UI from a background thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;async/await Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; Leveraging C#‚Äôs asynchronous features, you can write asynchronous methods and utilize the &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keyword within them to wait for background tasks to complete, automatically returning to the UI thread to execute subsequent UI update code upon completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-studies&#34;&gt;Case Studies
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;updating-the-ui-using-dispatcherinvoke-method&#34;&gt;Updating the UI using &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher.Invoke&lt;/code&gt; method
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    // Assume this is a time-consuming operation
    Task.Run(() =&amp;gt;
    {
        var result = LongRunningOperation(); // This is a simulated long-running calculation method
        
        // When the time-consuming operation is complete, update the UI on the UI thread
        Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(() =&amp;gt;
        {
            LabelStatus.Text = $&amp;quot;Calculation Result: {result}&amp;quot;;
        });
    });
}

private string LongRunningOperation()
{
    // Simulate a long-running operation
    Thread.Sleep(5000);
    return &amp;quot;Completed&amp;quot;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-the-asyncawait-keyword-with-taskrun&#34;&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt; keyword with &lt;code&gt;Task.Run&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;private async void Button_ClickAsync(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    Button button = sender as Button;
    button.IsEnabled = false; // Prevent duplicate clicks by the user

    try
    {
        // Start a background task
        var result = await Task.Run(() =&amp;gt; LongRunningOperation());

        // Automatically switch back to the UI thread to update the UI after the background task completes
        LabelStatus.Text = $&amp;quot;Calculation Result: {result}&amp;quot;;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        MessageBox.Show($&amp;quot;An error occurred: {ex.Message}&amp;quot;);
    }
    finally
    {
        button.IsEnabled = true; // Re-enable the button
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Upgrading the GCC version caused program crashes: hidden issues due to code non-compliance.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/gcc-upgrade-causes-program-crash-code-irregularities/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 23:19:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/gcc-upgrade-causes-program-crash-code-irregularities/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the same business code scenario, the program compiled and ran normally in a CentOS 7 environment. However, when switching to CentOS 8 and using an updated version of GCC for compilation, the program crashed. It‚Äôs worth noting that the issue only occurs in &lt;strong&gt;Release mode&lt;/strong&gt;, while &lt;strong&gt;Debug mode&lt;/strong&gt; does not exhibit any problems. This is the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve encountered a situation like this; after three days of investigation, we finally identified the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;problem-identification&#34;&gt;Problem Identification
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After investigation, the root cause of the issue was &lt;strong&gt;the function lacked a return value&lt;/strong&gt;. In Release mode, new versions of GCC perform more optimizations, which caused an unknown logic to occur within the function that originally did not have an explicit return value during execution, ultimately triggering a crash. Our conclusion is that &lt;strong&gt;compiler warnings should not be ignored, especially in legacy projects where some warnings may be dismissed, but it‚Äôs also important to avoid suppressing all warnings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;environment-details&#34;&gt;Environment Details
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CentOS 7 GCC Version:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CentOS 8 GCC Version:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crash-phenomena&#34;&gt;Crash Phenomena
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When analyzing the stack information for program crashes, we observed the following stack details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;[New LWP 1385902]
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library &amp;quot;/lib64/libthread_db.so.1&amp;quot;.
Core was generated by `./pstack_main`.
Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x00007ffe894b4420 in ?? ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007ffe894b4420 in ?? ()
#1  0x00000000004008e9 in main ()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stack doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear intuitive; the crash function‚Äôs stack information shows a &lt;code&gt;??&lt;/code&gt;, which makes troubleshooting even more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;code-example&#34;&gt;Code Example
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the issue, here is a minimal code example that reproduces the crash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;map&amp;gt;

int test() {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
}

int main() {
    test();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function in this code clearly does not explicitly return a value, and its return type is &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. According to the C++ standard, when a function is declared as an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; type, it must have a return value, otherwise it may lead to undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compilation-warning&#34;&gt;Compilation Warning
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our project, the CMake script suppresses many compile-time warnings, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;/root/pstack/main.cpp: In function ‚Äòint test()‚Äô:
/root/pstack/main.cpp:7:1: warning: no return statement in function returning non-void [-Wreturn-type]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This warning indicates that the &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function does not return a value, which is the root cause of the problem. Newer versions of GCC (such as 8.5.0) may make unstable optimizations with this undefined behavior when optimizing code, potentially leading to program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;assembly-code-differences&#34;&gt;Assembly Code Differences
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain the differences in GCC compiler optimization behavior, we compared assembly code generated by different versions of GCC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GCC 4.8.5 Generated Assembly Code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembly code is relatively verbose and includes handling logic for standard output streams (such as &lt;code&gt;std::cout&lt;/code&gt;). This indicates that the compiler performed more conservative optimizations, not optimizing excessively for the missing return value issue in the &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function, possibly to avoid a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GCC 8.5.0 Generated Assembly Code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version of GCC performed more optimizations, reducing the code volume. However, this optimization may have resulted in unpredictable behavior when executing functions without returning values, leading to program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this troubleshooting process, we deeply realized that in C++, &lt;strong&gt;function return values must be explicit&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly when a function is declared as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, a return value must be provided. When upgrading from older versions of compilers to newer versions of GCC, more optimization and stricter warning mechanisms may be encountered. Therefore, we recommend not &lt;strong&gt;disabling all warnings&lt;/strong&gt; during compilation, but rather selectively addressing them, especially common issues such as function return values and type matching.
Ultimately, by adding a return value to the &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function, the problem was resolved, and the program returned to normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>VMware Virtual Machine CPU Resource Usage Anomaly</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-machine-cpu-usage-anomaly/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 22:14:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-machine-cpu-usage-anomaly/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The business system, running in Windows version, is deployed locally and consumes approximately 5% of CPU resources. The Linux version of the business system, deployed within a VMware-installed CentOS8 environment, exhibits abnormal resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-description&#34;&gt;Problem Description
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host Machine: Windows 10 Enterprise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VMware: 17.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual Machine: CentOS8
The virtual machine resource allocation is &lt;code&gt;4C8GB&lt;/code&gt;, running the business system. The business system is deployed in the Linux system within the virtual machine, and the internal top command observes system resource usage. CPU utilization is not high, while the external Windows system‚Äôs Task Manager shows very high CPU resource consumption. Examining processes reveals that the VMware process consumes a large amount of CPU resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;+
|         Windows           |

+&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;+&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-concepts&#34;&gt;Key Concepts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting this issue wasn‚Äôt smooth, as the root cause wasn&amp;rsquo;t the business system itself but the virtual machine. How to shift thinking from conventional business code to system load, then from abnormal load data to pinpoint a soft interrupt, and finally arrive at the critical point ‚Äì what factors affect VMware soft interrupt efficiency? This article will first introduce various concepts and then provide solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hyper-v&#34;&gt;Hyper-V
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virtualization technology for Windows operating systems underwent a significant transformation. When Microsoft initially released WSL, enabling the Hyper-V service would prevent VMware virtual machines from working simultaneously. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until subsequent versions that VMware could be compatible with the Hyper-V service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;system-load&#34;&gt;System Load
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Linux systems, &amp;ldquo;load&amp;rdquo; refers to the number of processes currently running or waiting to be executed. The load is typically represented by three numbers: the average process count in the run queue over 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes respectively. These numbers can be viewed by running the &lt;code&gt;uptime&lt;/code&gt; command or the &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, these three numbers represent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-minute load:&lt;/strong&gt; The average number of processes in the run queue over the past 1 minute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5-minute load:&lt;/strong&gt; The average number of processes in the run queue over the past 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15-minute load:&lt;/strong&gt; The average number of processes in the run queue over the past 15 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of the load is the number of processes waiting to be executed within the system. If this number exceeds the logical CPU count for the system, it indicates a high system load, meaning many processes are waiting for processor resources. This can cause the system to become slow or unresponsive, depending on the severity of the load and the configuration and performance of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the load should remain within the logical CPU count range to optimize system performance. If the load consistently exceeds the CPU count, it may be necessary to further analyze processes in the system to identify the cause of the high load and take appropriate measures to adjust system resource allocation or optimize how processes run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analyzing-load-with-mpstat&#34;&gt;Analyzing Load with mpstat
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; command is used to report multiple pieces of information about one or more processors, including average load, CPU utilization, interrupts, and context switches. Within the &lt;code&gt;sysstat&lt;/code&gt; package, &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; is a valuable tool for analyzing system load conditions.  Here&amp;rsquo;s how to perform load analysis using &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install sysstat:&lt;/strong&gt;
If &lt;code&gt;sysstat&lt;/code&gt; isn‚Äôt installed on your system, use your system&amp;rsquo;s package manager to install it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run mpstat:&lt;/strong&gt;
Use the &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; command to view CPU usage and load. By default, &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; displays CPU utilization averages once per second. You can adjust the output frequency by specifying an interval. For example, to run &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; at a rate of one time per second, use the following command: &lt;code&gt;mpstat -P ALL 2&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; represents interrupt resource usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyze Output:&lt;/strong&gt;
The output from &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; includes CPU utilization for each processor, as well as the system&amp;rsquo;s average load. Pay particular attention to the average load and the utilization of each CPU to understand the system‚Äôs load conditions. If the load is high, further analysis can be done to determine which processes are causing it and whether there are any performance bottlenecks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combine with Other Tools:&lt;/strong&gt;
In addition to &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt;, you can use tools like &lt;code&gt;sar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pidstat&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;iostat&lt;/code&gt; to comprehensively analyze system performance. By combining the outputs of multiple tools, you can gain a more complete understanding of the system‚Äôs load conditions and identify the root causes of performance issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interrupt&#34;&gt;Interrupt
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section doesn&amp;rsquo;t elaborate on the content too much,
Recommended: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.codedump.info/post/20200522-sgfap-softirq/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;System Guide for Application Developers - CPU Part - Soft Interrupt&lt;/a&gt;
Frequent triggering of soft interrupts will also be reflected in system load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that analysis solely from the CPU perspective couldn‚Äôt pinpoint the issue, should we start to suspect that the system had become abnormal? It might be due to excessive load on the Linux operating system, causing VMware to consume an unusually high amount of CPU resources. By using &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; to analyze local virtual machines, we found that &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; utilization was abnormally high, approaching 25% per core, while in normal circumstances, when business processes were idle, &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; should have accounted for approximately 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a colleague‚Äôs development environment within the group, his CentOS 7 was deployed on VMware with normal resource usage. Conversely, in the Shanghai development environment, although also running on VMware, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t directly observe the host machine‚Äôs CPU resource situation. At this point, we faced multiple variables: VMware virtual machines, the Linux operating system, and the GCC version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting our focus to the test environment, the Shenzhen test environment was deployed on a physical machine running low-version GCC compiled services and was running on CentOS 8. Interestingly, in the Shenzhen environment, &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; utilization was normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate potential issues introduced by the GCC version, we deployed a program compiled with a high-version GCC to the Shenzhen environment for testing, which also yielded normal results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem seemed to become clearer, and we began to suspect that the operating system might be experiencing an issue. After all, CentOS 8 is no longer officially supported. Even after deploying clean CentOS 7 and CentOS 8, the problem persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we started to suspect the only remaining uncertainty: the VMware virtual machine software itself. Suddenly, a flash of insight occurred ‚Äì could we have inadvertently enabled Hyper-V previously without fully disabling it, thereby causing this issue? After all, interrupts are also implemented through virtualization software. Do different virtualization technologies have bugs? These questions deserved in-depth consideration and investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Microsoft official documentation, after completely disabling the Hyper-V service on the machine as described, VMware recovered normal operation on the host. This finally resolved the issue. As initially stated, this experience was convoluted and arduous, requiring comprehensive analysis and judgment. It was also our first time troubleshooting and pinpointing the problem down to the virtual machine level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-HyperV-Hypervisor
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off

        <title>C&#43;&#43; Programming Traps: A Detailed Explanation of Program Crashes Caused by Improper Use of `std::map`</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-programming-traps-std-map-crash-details/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 22:03:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-programming-traps-std-map-crash-details/</guid>
        <description>e&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the C++ standard library, &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt; is an associative container that stores elements in ascending order of keys (key) and provides efficient keyword lookup functionality. However, novice developers sometimes fall into trouble because they misunderstand the behavior of the square bracket operator &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, when using &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; to access a non-existent key, &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt; inserts a new key-value pair, and the default constructor will be used to initialize the value type corresponding to that key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;map&amp;gt;

int main() {
    std::map&amp;lt;std::string, int&amp;gt; myMap;

    // Incorrect usage: assuming here that we are trying to access a non-existent key and assume it will return 0
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Value for &#39;nonexistent_key&#39;: &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; myMap[&amp;quot;nonexistent_key&amp;quot;] &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

    // In fact, the above line of code creates a new key-value pair, where the value is initialized by the default constructor of int (usually 0)
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the above code does not directly cause the program to crash, this implicit insertion behavior can lead to unexpected side effects in some cases, such as resource leaks or changes that do not meet expectations. Worse still, in a multithreaded environment, concurrent access to uninitialized memory areas may even cause the program to crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent these problems, it is recommended to use &lt;code&gt;std::map::find()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;std::map::count()&lt;/code&gt; methods to check if the key exists, or explicitly insert elements using &lt;code&gt;std::map::insert()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;std::map&amp;lt;std::string, int&amp;gt; safeMap;
if (safeMap.count(&amp;quot;nonexistent_key&amp;quot;) == 0) {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Key does not exist.&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Value for existing key: &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; safeMap[&amp;quot;nonexistent_key&amp;quot;] &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
}

// Or explicitly insert a key-value pair, specifying the initial value
safeMap.insert({ &amp;quot;new_key&amp;quot;, 0 });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the map container stores objects of pointer type, the implicit insertion behavior will save an uninitialized pointer, and any operation on this pointer will cause the program to crash.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>pstack troubleshoot a hung process</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/pstack-troubleshooting-process-hangs/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 23:55:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/pstack-troubleshooting-process-hangs/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In software development and operations, deadlocked processes are frequently encountered. This situation can lead to performance degradation or service unavailability. This article introduces how to use the pstack tool to troubleshoot deadlocked process issues by analyzing process stack information to identify the root cause and resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: A child service within the risk control system experienced a deadlocked state, resulting in the unavailability of the risk control service. Due to the lack of service availability monitoring, the deadlocked process situation was not detected in a timely manner, leading to system unavailability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hung process refers to a process that has stopped responding but hasn&amp;rsquo;t exited. This situation can be caused by various reasons, such as deadlocks, resource exhaustion, or exceptions. To resolve these issues, we can use the &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool to analyze the process‚Äôs stack information and identify the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps&#34;&gt;Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; is a commonly used tool, often provided alongside &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; (GNU Debugger). You can install it using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get install gdb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obtain Process ID: First, we need to obtain the process ID (PID) of the zombie process. We can use the &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; command to list all processes and find the PID of the process we want to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool to analyze the process stack. Once you have obtained the process ID, you can use the &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool to retrieve the stack information for that process. Run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;pstack &amp;lt;PID&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will output the stack information of the process, displaying the sequence of function calls currently being executed. By analyzing this information, you can identify where the process is stuck and subsequently pinpoint the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyze Stack Information: By examining the stack information, you can find the cause of the process becoming zombie. You may discover deadlock situations, infinite loops, or other abnormal conditions. Take appropriate measures based on the specific situation, such as releasing locks, fixing code logic, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-study&#34;&gt;Case Study
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple demo, after the main function starts, a child thread is created and the actual function enters an infinite loop, causing the program to fail to terminate normally and enter a state of false death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0.0)
project(pstack_main VERSION 0.1.0 LANGUAGES C CXX)

include(CTest)

# Find the Threads library
find_package(Threads REQUIRED)

# Link with the Threads library

set(CPACK_PROJECT_NAME ${PROJECT_NAME})
set(CPACK_PROJECT_VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION})
include(CPack)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;thread&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;chrono&amp;gt;

void infiniteLoop() {
    while (true) {
        // Main thread enters an infinite loop
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread thread(infiniteLoop); // Create a thread to execute the infinite loop function
    thread.join(); // Wait for the thread to end
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the program, and examining the &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be seen that the program is in a false death state because of the infinite loop, the main thread enters an infinite loop, and the child thread cannot&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting out for a walk is always good.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/come-out-for-a-walk-is-good/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 10:30:43 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/come-out-for-a-walk-is-good/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If things had gone as the family planned, I would have stuck to studying power grids honestly and diligently, without venturing into coding. Had I erased the dust from my memory, it all stemmed from a chat with my roommate near the Spring Festival, which led to a review of my experiences over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-one&#34;&gt;Chapter One
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the &lt;em&gt;gaokao&lt;/em&gt; (national college entrance examination) couldn‚Äôt be described as good or bad; I got into a 211 university, and according to Dad&amp;rsquo;s original plan, I should have studied power grids and returned to work for the local electricity supply bureau. Earlier accounts had also mentioned how to gradually transition onto the IT path ‚Äì something that hadn‚Äôt been fully articulated before: financial perspective and self-discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my education in a rural school, and after primary school two, my family arranged for me to transfer to a school in the city district. Like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden, I initially struggled to adapt to the bustling prosperity of the city. I hadn‚Äôt been to the cinema very often, and specifically, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone with my parents, but relatives would take me. Heaven always bestows luck upon you; back then, I met a few like-minded friends, though we lost contact later on. Looking back, that period of youth was truly wonderful. After weekend tutoring, we‚Äôd clean out the classroom plastic bottles, quickly stepping on them to flatten and pack them into our backpacks to take home for Mom to save up ‚Äì accumulating them until they were enough to find a waste collector to handle disposal. We&amp;rsquo;d play chess, badminton, and Mahjong together, with push-ups as punishment for losing, which we still felt a little fortunate about; Dad had been taking me through various exercises since childhood. From this point on, my financial perspective was slightly skewed, I felt somewhat inferior, but these small misfortunes quickly passed. Our family wasn‚Äôt struggling financially, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t have much pocket money, sometimes couldn‚Äôt join our classmates in their activities, especially on weekends. Seeing our parents‚Äô efforts as they moved us from the village to the city. At this time, the seed had been planted, waiting for it to sprout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My simple-minded self was generally very happy during my studies, much like many graduates can only appreciate after graduation ‚Äì studying wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a difficult task; the investment and output converted relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-one-1&#34;&gt;Chapter One
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I layered in the memories of the Age of Empires, and during university, I encountered a laptop ‚Äì it was like Pandora‚Äôs Box opening, introducing me to games and connecting me with game merchants. Initially, I was a low-level salesperson, sourcing goods upstream and selling them through my own community channels, earning a little money. Later, I gradually understood the operational logic of the entire chain. The products we sold were simply mass-produced by upstream programs, and their costs approached zero. At this point, the road had already started to veer off course; there were further subdivisions within the field ‚Äì on the left was power grids, and on the right was automation (very complex, chip programming, factory electrical automation) ‚Äì I realized that software could make money, but it wasn‚Äôt much. Although the upstream channels did earn a lot, combined with my previous background in programming, I started tinkering here and there, making a little money. When choosing between specialized fields, I naturally chose automation. After finishing my third year of coursework, I didn&amp;rsquo;t attend many classes, constantly thinking about writing code to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in last year‚Äôs article, inspired by the beautiful vision of hackers, I came into programming through self-study ‚Äì I learned assembly language, penetration testing, game cheats, DLL hijacking, and data theft, familiarizing myself with various blackware and greyware. My parents taught me how to be a good person, and the law ultimately dissuaded me from going too far down that path; the road didn‚Äôt completely deviate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1&#34;&gt;Chapter 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous Post Link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/that-boy-talent-maybe-but-not-much/&#34; &gt;That Time When I Was Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also talked about a brief romance during university. Looking back, it was mostly longing for the love depicted in television dramas. As an immature mind at the time, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand how to love someone, let alone achieve: settling down and starting a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-two&#34;&gt;Chapter Two
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst the torrent of times, I was fortunate ‚Äì university‚Äôs tribulations led me to not pursue graduate studies; I immediately entered employment and enjoyed a smooth career path riding the wave of IT. It&amp;rsquo;s now my eighth year in this profession, but the hype money vanished as the industry matured, leading to its decline. Sometimes, I question whether my initial choice was correct ‚Äì perhaps entering the power grid as suggested by my father would have been a better option. Such thoughts might linger during the first five years of employment, but they gradually fade away with time. My recruitment into HSBC lasted five years without a change of company, which resulted in certain deficiencies regarding technical understanding, industry knowledge, and self-awareness. Following arrangements from the Hangzhou headquarters, I relocated to the Shenzhen branch, experiencing a workplace struggle (which, upon reflection, proved detrimental to both sides ‚Äì ultimately benefiting the board) fueled by my passion for technology. I returned to Hangzhou with a youthful exuberance, only to later withdraw and head to Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I planned to settle in Hangzhou, register, and purchase property during the highest interest rates and peak housing prices, risking being trapped; my finances were limited, making it impossible to bear the burden of mortgage payments, compounded by an industry downturn, leading to emotional instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-three&#34;&gt;Chapter Three
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having been around for so many years, having seen so much, I‚Äôve made my own mistakes and wasted time. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m doing well. Through experiences and through people, one inevitably grows and matures. If I were to remain at home all the time, I don‚Äôt know what form my flaws would manifest in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Designed aË°åÊÉÖ SDK, implementing different callback function implementations, and performed an extensive test.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Regarding byte order: A layman&amp;rsquo;s explanation &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://example.com/post/2023/01-10-%e4%b8%bb%e6%9c%ba%e5%ba%8f%e3%80%81%e7%bd%91%e7%bb%9c%e5%ba%8f%ef%bc%8c%e9%80%9a%e8%bf%87%e8%b0%83%e8%af%95%e5%99%a8%ef%bc%8c%e7%9b%b4%e6%8e%a5%e8%a7%82%e5%af%9f&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Host Order, Network Order, observed directly via debugger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of computer science, certain design habits have formed due to historical reasons, just like the width of a hip dictates the width of a rocket&amp;rsquo;s thrusters ‚Äì there‚Äôs no need to rigidly analyze their ‚Äúadvantages‚Äù and ‚Äúdisadvantages‚Äù; it‚Äôs simply a matter of historical convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the translation of the provided text into English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Mining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the current situation is a result of historical habits plus commercialization, and it has little to do with technology itself. ARM can be set up as big-endian or little-endian. The TCP/IP header still uses big-endian (network byte order). There are also many storage protocols/specifications that use big-endian to store data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the three questions posed by the user seem incorrect in today&amp;rsquo;s view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do computers generally adopt little-endian storage? ‚Äì&amp;gt; Incorrect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is storing the low byte in a little-endian manner more efficient than in a big-endian manner? ‚Äì&amp;gt; Efficiency will not be higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any argument about these three questions using current technology is like shooting an arrow first and then drawing the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we say that the choice of big-endian or little-endian did have some objective factors in the history of computer development: The advantage of host-byte order (little-endian) is that a 8-bit * 4 adder can be easily made, requiring only an 8-bit adder to sequentially add all bytes from low to high, and the carry circuit is very simple. If it were big-endian, it would require loading 32 bits once, which cannot perform calculations. Nowadays, the difference between loading 8 bits or 32 bits is not significant, but in the early days when storage prices were expensive, simplicity was always preferred, so the host-byte order chose little-endian based on cost considerations. The advantage of network byte order (big-endian) is that early devices had very small caches. Taking the high byte first could quickly determine the message information: packet length (need to prepare how much cache), address range (IP addresses are matched from front to back). Early network devices&amp;rsquo; caches were at the byte level, and taking the high byte was indeed a little faster. Therefore, network devices used big-endian based on cost considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the choice of byte order has historically been more influenced by application scenarios and costs (such as PPC/MIPS being more suitable for network devices), and the configuration of big-endness and little-endness has been carried over to this day due to compatibility reasons. In today&amp;rsquo;s view, these advantages no longer exist, they are merely historical habits.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Anti-Debug</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/program-anti-debug/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:46:36 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I was feeling the urge to browse for new wallpapers, sticking with my usual black series, with some areas colored in, and the desktop needing to display icons. Other color schemes would result in blurry icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stared at the assembly code, trying to figure it out, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand it. I tried throwing it to an &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, explaining the instructions, but it failed to explain the context ‚Äì clearly, this was a command used for a specific scenario. Regular code isn‚Äôt like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; was no longer as useful as a search engine at this point; its knowledge base of assembly language was insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;TrapFlag&lt;/code&gt; is a flag bit in the register file. When this flag is set, it throws an exception &lt;code&gt;SINGLE_STEP&lt;/code&gt;. Because when we trace the code, this flag will be cleared by the debugger, so we won&amp;rsquo;t see this exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In actual testing, if you directly step over detecting functions, debugging will not be detected. Only when entering the detection function to execute will it be detected (based on research materials, yet to be verified in practice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese related materials are based on the English articles from websites, which introduce many anti-debugging techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Download Focus News/CCTV Video Files</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-download-focus-interview-cctv-videos/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:23:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-download-focus-interview-cctv-videos/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, someone asked how to download Focus Interview videos. My mind immediately went to the usual ‚Äì eight or nine out of ten times it‚Äôs encrypted using an &lt;code&gt;m3u8&lt;/code&gt; method, and a bit of simple processing is all it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;downloader&#34;&gt;Downloader
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-CLI&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-CLI&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;code&gt;m3u8 downloader&lt;/code&gt; is an open-source command-line m3u8/HLS/dash downloader that supports ordinary AES-128-CBC decryption, multi-threading, custom request headers, etc. Supports Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and English. English Supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;browser-extensions&#34;&gt;Browser Extensions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ngjclnbcdbahekojpkhancmiobdahemb&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Live Stream Downloader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;honeyed-confidence&#34;&gt;Honeyed Confidence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the address, assuming it was solved, turned out to be nothing ‚Äì unable to parse segments normally, query information, and discover that the official had processed the download address, requiring manual replacement of the &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; parsed by the plugin into the following links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;https://newcntv.qcloudcdn.com/asp/hls/2000/0303000a/3/default/***********************/2000.m3u8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of January 2024, the address is still valid; if there are any changes in the future, analyze the webpage independently.

        <title>Bulk Modify SQL Server Database Disk File Permissions</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-modify-sqlserver-database-disk-permissions/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:06:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-modify-sqlserver-database-disk-permissions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The company adjusted its security policies. Ultimately, ‚ÄòMechanical Mini‚Äô was relocated back home as a backup server, along with a full system reinstallation. Ubuntu switched to Windows Server; due to an irregular activation method ‚Äì used at home ‚Äì it seemed like it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be activated, and that was fine. An unconventional activation triggered Microsoft‚Äôs detection (running normally for half a month), the server would automatically shut down after running for one hour. After reviewing the system logs, it was discovered that this was due to using a pirated version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn‚Äôt much else to do, so the system was reinstalled again, and SQL Server also needed to be reinstalled ‚Äì it&amp;rsquo;s always a bit of a pain each time. File permission control is very strict, making it impossible to attach the database normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;error-message&#34;&gt;Error Message
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the system reinstallation, &lt;code&gt;SqlServer&lt;/code&gt; may encounter error 5120, an operating system access denied error, when attaching a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;processing-script&#34;&gt;Processing Script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referencing the previous link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-and-legacy-permissions/&#34; &gt;Batch Update Local Git Repository&lt;/a&gt;, it‚Äôs that familiar script all over again ‚Äì modified to, we iterate through folders while modifying file permissions. Currently used with full editing permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most tutorials online have you manually modify files. They only need to change a few files each time? I always have to process batches of files; doing everything manually is going to drive me crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;$currentUserName = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name

        <title>Linux System Benchmark Test</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-system-benchmark-test/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 10:56:23 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-system-benchmark-test/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Windows platform has RuMaster (Entertainment Master), which isn&amp;rsquo;t known for highly accurate data, but it‚Äôs still useful as a reference. Of course, there are other professional benchmarking software options available. When it comes to Linux systems, there haven‚Äôt seemed to be any particularly suitable benchmarking software found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sysbench is a versatile benchmark testing tool that can be used to test CPU, memory, file I/O, thread performance, and more. You can use Sysbench to execute various performance testing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently have three machines available for testing: the Mechanical Artist mini laptop, a local small host machine, an Alibaba Cloud Dev development cloud server, and a Huawei Cloud Dev server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-sysbench&#34;&gt;Installing Sysbench
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On most Linux distributions, you can use the package manager to install Sysbench. For example, on CentOS 8, you can use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo dnf install sysbench
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sysbench-usage-examples&#34;&gt;Sysbench Usage Examples
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing CPU performance: &lt;code&gt;sysbench --test=cpu run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing memory read performance: &lt;code&gt;sysbench --test=memory run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing file I/O performance:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sysbench --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw prepare
sysbench --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw run
sysbench --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw cleanup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing multi-threaded performance: &lt;code&gt;sysbench --test=threads --num-threads=4 run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing MySQL database performance (requires adjusting the maximum connection number):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=yourusername --mysql-password=yourpassword --oltp-table-size=1000000 prepare
sysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=yourusername --mysql-password=yourpassword --max-time=60 --oltp-read-only=off --oltp-test-mode=complex --max-requests=0 run
sysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=yourusername --mysql-password=yourpassword cleanup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt; is a good thing or not, the table above could not be arranged according to the previously mastered &lt;code&gt;Markdown&lt;/code&gt;, and it was not made into a table to display, which would result in a very poor effect. Customizing the theme limited the maximum page width, and a series of page configurations were adjusted accordingly, changing the width to percentage limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple method is to use tools like TablesGenerator to generate HTML tables (content complexity is not suitable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or write it using Google Docs online and then download and save it as an HTML document, directly copy it into the blog (simple and direct, ultimately adopted).
Ensure that the config configuration is enabled with unsafe configuration items, and independently configure the page width.
In Hugo, you can set the width of a page individually. This can be achieved by adding a custom parameter in the page&amp;rsquo;s Front Matter.  Here‚Äôs an example:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your Markdown page&amp;rsquo;s Front Matter section (usually at the beginning of the file), add a custom parameter such as &lt;code&gt;custom_width&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;---
title: &amp;quot;My Page&amp;quot;
date: 2024-01-09
custom_width: &amp;quot;800px&amp;quot;  # Set width to 800 pixels
---

Content...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your Hugo theme, find or create the corresponding single page template file (e.g., &lt;code&gt;layouts/_default/single.html&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the single page template, check if there is a &lt;code&gt;custom_width&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the Front Matter and apply it to the appropriate HTML elements, such as &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34;&gt;{{ define &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; }}
  &amp;lt;div style=&amp;quot;max-width: {{ with .Params.custom_width }}{{ . }}{{ else }}100%{{ end }}; margin: 0 auto;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    {{ .Content }}
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we used inline styles (the &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; attribute) to set the &lt;code&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt; property for the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; element when no &lt;code&gt;custom_width&lt;/code&gt; parameter is specified, defaulting the width to 100%. &lt;code&gt;margin: 0 auto;&lt;/code&gt; centers the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that in actual applications, you may need to adjust this example based on your theme structure and CSS styling details. Ensure that when adjusting styles, you maintain consistency and readability with the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the slight difference in the enabled theme, the site&amp;rsquo;s custom &lt;code&gt;CSS&lt;/code&gt; configuration was finally adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Git Disable HTTP Repository</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-disable-http-repositories/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 21:22:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-disable-http-repositories/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Updated habit software version, unsure which Git version to start from, prohibiting fetching code from &lt;code&gt;Http&lt;/code&gt; repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;fatal: Unencrypted HTTP is not supported for GitLab. Ensure the repository remote URL is using HTTPS
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-introduction&#34;&gt;Background Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environment: Windows platform, I‚Äôve always used Tiny Turtle to operate Git, and key configuration was also handled through it. I previously created a script to batch update local repositories.
Previous article link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-and-legacy-permissions/&#34; &gt;Batch Update Local Git Repository&lt;/a&gt;
Today when I went home to execute the code update, the previous error occurred, and the repository could no longer be updated normally. I was planning to use &lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt;‚Äôs configuration to continue using the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; protocol to update the repository, but I searched everywhere without finding the corresponding configuration item.
The simplest solution is of course to switch to the &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; protocol to update the repository, as the &lt;code&gt;gitlab&lt;/code&gt; configured by the company will not provide the &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; protocol in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy-issues&#34;&gt;Legacy Issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing the batch update local repository script previously, we initially planned to use &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; to pull the repository and didn&amp;rsquo;t investigate thoroughly. The &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; configuration information configured via Small Turtle was not synchronized to the config file, resulting in a &amp;ldquo;permission denied&amp;rdquo; error when executing with the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git pull # prompts for permission issues and cannot update the repository normally
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking the key configuration using the command was correct: &lt;code&gt;ssh -T git@gitlab.yintech.net&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can successfully pull code using Small Turtle (TortoiseGit), but receive a &amp;ldquo;key not recognized&amp;rdquo; error when using the &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; command from the command line, this may be because Small Turtle uses PuTTY&amp;rsquo;s SSH key while the command line uses OpenSSH&amp;rsquo;s SSH key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key configuration in Small Turtle does not read key file information from the system &lt;code&gt;.ssh&lt;/code&gt; folder; instead, it configures the path to the key file separately through the interface when configuring the repository. There‚Äôs a useful trick: configuring the first pulled repository with its key allows other repositories to reuse that same key file. PuTTY loads the key and doesn&amp;rsquo;t immediately exit but starts a proxy service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adjusting the global configuration to not use the system default &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; configuration, Git Bash will use TortoisePlink for SSH operations. This configuration is suitable for situations where you are using TortoiseGit with the built-in PuTTY tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git config --global core.sshCommand &amp;quot;&#39;C:/Program Files/TortoiseGit/bin/TortoisePlink.exe&#39; -batch -ssh&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please modify the execution file path in the above configuration to match your Small Turtle installation path. Since the full path is configured, no need to add it to the system environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AI Programming and Task Decomposition</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-programming-and-task-decomposition/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 08:44:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-programming-and-task-decomposition/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I added a copy function to the site, which took me half a day of tinkering. Ultimately, the rendering effect wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite satisfactory, and as a somewhat mediocre frontend developer, I didn‚Äôt plan on improving it ‚Äì if it worked, it was good enough. This year, I used &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; to develop a mini-program, which has also made me more familiar with frontend development. I refactored it (the &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; redesigned it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realization: Breaking down tasks really helps; many small tasks are quite natural for the &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; to develop. For the closed mini-program, 75% of the code was provided by &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, broken down into multiple tasks delivered, and manually assembled the project code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;previous-context&#34;&gt;Previous Context
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.github.io/post/2022/001/%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%BA%E5%BE%88%E7%AE%80%E5%8D%95%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%8B%E6%83%85%E5%A2%9E%E5%8A%A0%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E5%A4%8D%E5%88%B6%E6%8C%89%E9%92%AE/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Making simple things easier: Adding a code copy button&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;promot&lt;/strong&gt;: Design CSS and JavaScript code to locate webpage elements with the class &amp;ldquo;highlight&amp;rdquo;, and within their container, add a copy button to enable copying of the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first draft of the code was immediately problematic; I generated a revised version that is largely functional, but the copied content is incorrect, containing redundant text. Further guidance led to optimization, specifying core color design and effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having learned your specific requirements for button size and color, we redesigned the button styles to accommodate these demands.  Here‚Äôs the adjusted CSS style sheet, incorporating your provided color scheme and optimizing the button size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-css&#34;&gt;.copy-btn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 2px; /* Adjust position */
  right: 2px;
  padding: 3px 6px; /* Reduce size */
  font-size: 12px; /* Decrease font size */
  background-color: #8FD1E1; /* Button background color */
  color: #272822; /* Text color */
  border: 1px solid #272822; /* Border color */
  border-radius: 3px; /* Rounded corners */
  cursor: pointer;
  opacity: 0.7; /* Default semi-transparent */
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease, background-color 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition effect */
}

.copy-btn:hover {
  opacity: 1; /* Unhide on hover */
  background-color: #A3D4E5; /* Background color on hover */
}

.highlight {
  position: relative;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this style sheet, I reduced the button&amp;rsquo;s size and font size to create a more refined look. The button‚Äôs default state is semi-transparent, becoming fully opaque when hovered over, with a slightly brighter background color for visual feedback. This design meets your color requirements while maintaining modern and user-friendly characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a simpler &lt;code&gt;JavaScript&lt;/code&gt; implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;document.addEventListener(&#39;DOMContentLoaded&#39;, function() {
  // Find all .highlight elements
  const highlights = document.querySelectorAll(&#39;.highlight&#39;);

  highlights.forEach(function(highlight) {
    // Create copy button
    const copyBtn = document.createElement(&#39;button&#39;);
    copyBtn.textContent = &#39;Copy&#39;;
    copyBtn.classList.add(&#39;copy-btn&#39;);

    // Add the button to each .highlight element
    highlight.appendChild(copyBtn);

    // Add click event listener
    copyBtn.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function() {
      // Assume the first &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; element within .highlight contains the code to copy
      const code = highlight.querySelector(&#39;code&#39;) ? highlight.querySelector(&#39;code&#39;).textContent : &#39;&#39;;

      navigator.clipboard.writeText(code).then(() =&amp;gt; {
        // Display success message
        copyBtn.textContent = &#39;Copied!&#39;;
        setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; {
          copyBtn.textContent = &#39;Copy&#39;;
        }, 2000);
      }).catch(err =&amp;gt; {
        console.error(&#39;Copy failed: &#39;, err);
      });
    });
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I had hoped to see a copy button added in the top-right corner of the code area, due to my lack of familiarity with frontend development, I was unable to accurately describe the functionality based on keywords and spent several rounds iterating with &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; without achieving the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen what impact &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; will have on software development as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Oriental Zhentan Short Essay Incident: A Collision of Culture and Commerce</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/dongfang-zhenxuan-essay-controversy-culture-vs-commerce/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 18:57:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/dongfang-zhenxuan-essay-controversy-culture-vs-commerce/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Zen Selection short essay incident was a online uproar triggered by Oriental Zen Selection‚Äôs official account denying that anchor Dong Yufei was the author of all the short essays. The truth is now unrecoverable, and the company&amp;rsquo;s power struggles have pushed this matter into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish‚Äôs seven-second memory will be handed over to &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; for writing, having experimented with &lt;code&gt;Bing AI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT Plus&lt;/code&gt;. The former provided more complete information, while the search engine still obtained more data, but the output blog content was not as complete and had a rigid format; the latter generated content based on keywords, which wasn‚Äôt as complete but could obtain full blog content. If given the URLs of reference materials, it could optimize the generated article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dongyu He incident, involving a short essay by Oriental Select, is a dispute centered around copyright and creative ownership. Beginning on December 5, 2023, it involved a series of interactions between anchor Dong Yuhe and Oriental Select. This storm not only revealed the complexities of commercial operations but also sparked profound reflections on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-5-2023-event-origin&#34;&gt;December 5, 2023: Event Origin
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongyu Hui, a host from Oriental Zhentan, quickly went viral after reciting ‚Äúshort essays‚Äù in a pre-release video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Zhentan stated in the video comments that most of these short essays were created by the copywriting team and not entirely from Dongyu Hui‚Äôs own hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-13-2023-dong-yufeis-response&#34;&gt;December 13, 2023: Dong Yufei‚Äôs Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Yufei published a lengthy article opposing the defamation of anyone under the guise of ‚Äúfan circles,‚Äù stating her position on the matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-14-2023-management-response&#34;&gt;December 14, 2023: Management Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Xuhe (CEO of Oriental Zhensheng) released an apology video, admitting to management loopholes within the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yu Minhong (Chairman of Oriental Zhensheng) also responded to the incident, expressing apologies to Dong Yuhui.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-16-2023-major-decisions&#34;&gt;December 16, 2023: Major Decisions
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Zhentan officially removed Sun Dongxu from the CEO position, with Yu Minhong assuming the role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the same day, Yu Minhong published an apology letter, stating that he would unblock users who had been banned from live streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-18-2023-dong-yufeis-new-role&#34;&gt;December 18, 2023: Dong Yufei‚Äôs New Role
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Oriental Education &amp;amp; Technology Group appoints Dong Yufei as Chairman and Cultural Assistant of New Oriental Education &amp;amp; Technology Group, concurrently serving as Vice President of New Oriental Culture &amp;amp; Tourism Group.
-‰øûÊïèÊ¥™ (Yu Minhong) revealed that he will establish a studio with Dong Yufei to open new live broadcast accounts and live rooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-and-reflection&#34;&gt;Conclusion and Reflection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This storm was not only a dispute over copyright and creative ownership, but also deeply reflected the collision between culture and commerce. In today‚Äôs digital and fragmented era, the ownership of content copyrights has become a topic worthy of deep consideration. The Oriental Sanshifen Incident, not only a media storm, but also a profound reflection on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As observers, how should we view this collision between culture and commerce? While pursuing commercial interests, how can we protect and respect the creative labor of creators? These questions are worth deep consideration for each of us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game Psychology: Competitive Gaming</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-competitive-gaming/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 10:26:22 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-competitive-gaming/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games of the &amp;ldquo;pay-to-win&amp;rdquo; type, here we will not discuss this; within the gaming community, this is collectively referred to as ‚ÄúRenminbi Warriors‚Äù ‚Äì requiring an affluent wallet rather than understanding game settings. Their enjoyment lies in the entourage of smaller players surrounding them and the thrill of ‚Äúraid.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive games with a large audience, such as: League of Legends, DOTA, Honor of Kings, PUBG, these types of games have complete worldviews and their game competitions have entered a benign cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology is indeed a key field in game design, and social psychology is particularly important. Understanding people‚Äôs behavior, needs, and motivations can help design more engaging gaming experiences. Regarding the relationship between ‚Äúshowing off‚Äù and social psychology, we can look at it from the following angles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Identity:&lt;/strong&gt; People often seek to establish a sense of identity within social groups. In games, if designs allow players to feel they are outstanding in some way, attracting the attention of other players, this may increase their social identity. This could manifest as boasting skills or showcasing earned rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games have adopted social competition elements, encouraging players to showcase their achievements on social networks. This can be achieved through leaderboards, achievement systems, or multiplayer battles. Such designs stimulate competitive psychology between players and may lead some players to perform more impressively to gain social recognition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Expression:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games allow players to express themselves through customizing characters, virtual items, etc. This self-expression is not just for showing off; it can also be a way of expressing personality and social communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teamwork:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games emphasize teamwork, achieving game goals through social interaction. In such situations, boasting behavior may not be encouraged but rather emphasizes collaboration and mutual support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Reward Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design can adopt psychological reward systems to stimulate positive social behaviors in players. For example, rewarding or granting privileges to players to encourage them to actively participate in social interactions.
Overall, social psychology in game design can be used to shape player interaction and social experiences. Boasting behavior may exist in some situations, but game designers typically strive to balance this behavior to ensure that the gaming experience is positive and interesting for all players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about where I was writing, without a complete outline, it‚Äôs a bit chaotic.
The author often plays League of Legends, which is a memory of our generation. Most parents don&amp;rsquo;t like their children playing games because they haven&amp;rsquo;t deeply understood or experienced this type of game; of course, it has to do with the game settings. Each game is a new beginning, and for many children, when they play, they don‚Äôt bring much thought into it, belonging to self-exploration gameplay. Under this mode, the outcome of the game depends more on the child&amp;rsquo;s inherent gaming talent. Based on my actual experience, a large part of the players belong to this type, for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost is not money, but time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There‚Äôs also entertainment mode within the game, designed to cater to recreational players. League of Legends, this competitive game, for me, was more about realizing a ‚ÄúThree Kingdoms dream.‚Äù Starting off, you have nothing in your pockets, relying on your own understanding, farming, spending money, controlling vision, setting traps and ambushes for the opponent ‚Äì it‚Äôs largely about thinking your way through the game. Without exceptional gaming talent, you can still find immense enjoyment. The feeling of commanding the overall situation, the joy of turning a losing game around. And there are also many viewers who often mention ‚Äúcasual players‚Äù ‚Äì they no longer play the game but still watch the matches during major world events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs worth mentioning ‚Äúgame time.‚Äù This isn&amp;rsquo;t referring to the duration of a single match, but rather the amount of time you spend in the game ‚Äì on weekends in the afternoons, or evenings between 7 pm and 10 pm after work. You‚Äôll find that you can usually communicate normally with your teammates, and your signals are understood and responded to. If you switch to other times, such as playing through the night, you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to encounter ‚Äúgaming addicts,‚Äù favorable situations where nothing happens, and in unfavorable situations, they‚Äôll complain about you to your family ‚Äì you can almost feel their resentment through the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As someone who works in the IT industry and plays a lot of games, I‚Äôve tried various types, always preferring to think my way through the game rather than relying on reaction speed or talent. Compared to professionals or younger players, my reactions are slower, and I&amp;rsquo;m accustomed to coordinating with teammates and taking command of the team‚Äôs strategy. When I first started playing, it was during my student years, guided by older brothers from an YY guild.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, regarding the current game environment, it feels quite agitated and lacks the purity of before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After graduating, playing high-level segment games was really exhausting. The entire game required intense focus, thinking about the opponent&amp;rsquo;s plans, and how to counter their setups. It‚Äôs that kind of experience where you don‚Äôt want to continue after finishing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let‚Äôs be honest, if you‚Äôre considered a very good player, without professional competition, it wouldn‚Äôt have much impact on your life trajectory. While it can serve as a social tool, it&amp;rsquo;s not something you can make a living from or establish yourself in society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-player games and online games are two different types of games that differ significantly in their gameplay, experience, and technology. Here are some key aspects to understand the differences between single-player and online games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connection Method:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games (Offline/Single-player):&lt;/strong&gt; These games are played on a local device alone, without requiring an internet connection. Players can enjoy the game experience even without network connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games (Online/Multiplayer):&lt;/strong&gt; This type of game typically requires an internet connection because players need to interact with other players in real time. Online games can be cooperative or competitive, involving online social interaction and esports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player Interaction:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players primarily interact with artificial intelligence, pre-set tasks, or opposing elements within the game. The gaming experience is generally more personalized, influenced by the in-game design and storyline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players can interact with other real players from around the world. This may include collaborating on missions, competing against each other, or participating in esports competitions, as well as social elements like chat, guild systems, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Design and Content:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design focuses more on providing a complete, independent storyline and gaming experience. The game content is typically pre-designed, and players explore, solve puzzles, or fight within the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design needs to consider real-time interaction and player competition or collaboration. The game content may be more dynamic, including regular updates, online events, and social interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Generally run offline, with relatively low requirements for device performance and internet connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Require a strong internet connection and high demands on server and network performance to ensure smooth real-time interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Models:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Typically use one-time purchase or download business models, where players buy the game to play it fully on their local devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; May employ various business models such as free-to-play, advertising, item purchases, or subscriptions to maintain server operations and continuously update game content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these differences helps players clarify their preferences when choosing games and allows game designers to better meet player expectations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Cloud Servers and Script Kiddies</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cloud-servers-and-script-kids/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 15:08:53 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cloud-servers-and-script-kids/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Mining&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural Network&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Alibaba Cloud server was recently purchased during the Double Eleven event: an economy version with a price of 99 per year and low configuration, which is used as a jumpboard to proxy home services, it‚Äôs also a decent option. The activity lasts until 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, a Shanghai region server was selected to minimize latency when proxying home machines. Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 were installed, with the server version being deployed later.  Suddenly, a &amp;ldquo;access denied&amp;rdquo; message appeared, initially assuming it was due to a server update that would resolve itself. After five minutes, attempting to connect again still resulted in denial of login.  Searching for related error messages indicated that someone was attempting to log in, and excessive incorrect password attempts were preventing access.
I had previously encountered security attack scripts, so I immediately suspected a brute-force login attempt by malicious actors. The firewall settings were simplified, without enabling whitelisting, exposing ports 3389 for two machines publicly, much like bait in a fish pond.  Once identified as being targeted by script kiddies, the next steps were straightforward: setting up a firewall whitelist to allow only the company‚Äôs and home network IP addresses to access the proxy service.
&lt;code&gt;frps&lt;/code&gt; proxy server previously had no logging configuration, but after enabling logging, it was quite amusing ‚Äì all sorts of domestic and international IP addresses were attempting to log into the home server. Fortunately, there was one server version running, which made me realize that if the Windows 11 machine hadn‚Äôt been targeted, it would have eventually been compromised due to the relatively simple password settings.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>- Batch update local Git repositories and resolve legacy permission issues.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-and-legacy-permissions/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 14:16:22 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-and-legacy-permissions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The projects within the team have dependencies on each other, and due to historical reasons, submodules haven‚Äôt been used to manage these project dependencies. Daily development requires manually updating the repository code one by one, otherwise various strange issues may arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to online resources, the structure is generally similar. A local manual repository directory (&lt;strong&gt;git_list.txt&lt;/strong&gt;) is maintained, and a script iterates through the directories to perform an update in one go. Before starting each project, this script needs to be executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;linux&#34;&gt;linux
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;create new file: batch_pull.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;#!/bin/bash

echo &amp;quot;============ Updating Repository ===================&amp;quot;

# Check if git_list.txt exists
if [ ! -f &amp;quot;git_list.txt&amp;quot; ]; then
  echo &amp;quot;git_list.txt file does not exist! Please create and add the Git repository URLs to pull.&amp;quot;
  exit 1
else
  echo &amp;quot;============ Detected Git Repository List File ===================&amp;quot;
fi

# Read each URL from git_list.txt and execute the pull operation
while read -r url; do
  if [ -d &amp;quot;$url&amp;quot; ]; then
    cd &amp;quot;$url&amp;quot; || continue
    git pull
    cd ..
    echo &amp;quot;Pull $url completed!&amp;quot;
    echo &amp;quot;========================================&amp;quot;
  else
    echo &amp;quot;Directory $url does not exist, skipping pull.&amp;quot;
  fi
done &amp;lt; &amp;quot;git_list.txt&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;windows&#34;&gt;Windows
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a new file: batch_pull.bat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-batch&#34;&gt;@echo off
chcp 65001 &amp;gt; nul
rem Enter the directory of the script
cd /d &amp;quot;%~dp0&amp;quot;

rem Check if git_list.txt exists
if not exist &amp;quot;git_list.txt&amp;quot; (
  echo git_list.txt file does not exist! Please create and add the Git repository URLs you want to pull.
  exit /b 1
) else (
  echo ============ Detected Git repository list file =========
)

rem Read each URL from git_list.txt and execute the pull operation
for /f %%i in (git_list.txt) do (
  if exist &amp;quot;%%i&amp;quot; (
    pushd &amp;quot;%%i&amp;quot;
    git pull
    popd
    echo Pull %%i completed!
    echo ========================================
  ) else (
    echo Directory %%i does not exist, skipping pull.
  )
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;historical-issues&#34;&gt;Historical Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also addressed the &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; folder permission files encountered after reinstalling the system: &lt;strong&gt;Fatal error &amp;ldquo;unsafe repository (&amp;rsquo;/home/repon&amp;rsquo; is owned by someone else)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.
Most suggested solutions online originate from &lt;code&gt;stack overflow&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add trust to the repository directory: &lt;code&gt;git config --global --add safe.directory /home/repon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manually modify the configuration file &lt;code&gt;.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt;, specifying the directory to add trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;[safe]
    directory = /home/repon
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using this method, repository updates are normal, but there are many warning messages displayed in the console every time &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; is executed, indicating owner errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;desktop-system-reinstallation&#34;&gt;Desktop System Reinstallation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machines developed for a long time without system reinstallation, the system partition contained an explosion of garbage files, so I took some time to reinstall the system and encountered this permission issue again. Previous scripts would not run because the permissions were incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the new approach, directly add &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, so that &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; automatically trusts all directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git config --global --add safe.directory &amp;quot;*&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is suspected to be a user permission problem, or whether everyone has not adapted to the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; platform. There are similar &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt; commands.  You can modify folder ownership. Of course, if your directories are few, manually modifying ownership also works. However, this work computer has added domain information. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s an abnormal domain deployed by the company or whether there is an anomaly in the local system settings. The user list cannot find the user used for login, and finally processed through command-line operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With administrator permissions, execute the &lt;code&gt;powershell&lt;/code&gt; script &lt;code&gt;change_ower.ps1&lt;/code&gt;, remember to adjust the script file encoding to &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt; so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t display garbled characters in Chinese operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-powershell&#34;&gt;# Get the current user&#39;s username
$currentUserName = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name

# Set PowerShell&#39;s character encoding to UTF-8
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8

# The root directory path to change ownership
$rootDirectory = &amp;quot;G:\workspace&amp;quot;  # Replace with the actual directory path

# Recursively iterate through directories and change file and folder owners
Get-ChildItem -Path $rootDirectory -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    $itemPath = $_.FullName

    # Check if it&#39;s a file or a folder
    if ($_ -is [System.IO.DirectoryInfo]) {
        # If it&#39;s a folder, use icacls to change the owner permission
        $icaclsResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;Changed the owner of folder $itemPath to $currentUserName&amp;quot;
        } else {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;Unable to change the owner of folder $itemPath. Error information: $icaclsResult&amp;quot;
        }
    } else {
        # If it&#39;s a file, use icacls to change the owner permission
        $takeownResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            # Write-Host &amp;quot;Changed the owner of file $itemPath to $currentUserName&amp;quot;
        } else {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;Unable to change the owner of file $itemPath. Error information: $takeownResult&amp;quot;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpected situations still occurred, and the Chinese information output by the script was garbled. I tried setting the console character encoding and adjusting the script encoding, but the output was all garbled.  It is likely that my brain wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear at all. I tried enabling the beta feature in Control Panel - Region - Language Settings to globally enable Unicode encoding, and the script executed normally. Several development software programs could not work properly. Later, when reviewing materials, I remembered to adjust the script file encoding to &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wpf-learning-resources/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The potholes in the mini-program development haven‚Äôt been filled, and we‚Äôve just dug a new one with &lt;strong&gt;WPF&lt;/strong&gt;. Recently, the company has been experiencing some turbulence, and remote collaboration communication is invariably less efficient than desired. So, we&amp;rsquo;ve taken on the development of client interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wpf&#34;&gt;WPF
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/dotnet/desktop/wpf/introduction-to-wpf?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8&amp;amp;preserve-view=true&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cnblogs.com/zh7791/p/11502696.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF Basic Summary (Learning Suggestions)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wpfsoft.com/introduction&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF Chinese Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/638815741&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF Personal Summary and Learning Recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;WPF&lt;/code&gt; interface design uses many concepts similar to web frontend design, striving to isolate UI design from business logic as much as possible, which is the desired division of labor in internet companies. This year I just finished tinkering with Mini Programs, and many concepts are common, making it relatively easy to get started. These are considered the ‚ÄúDao‚Äù in modern UI design ‚Äì mastering the basic framework concepts makes the path less prone to deviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For readers who have previous &lt;code&gt;WinForms&lt;/code&gt; development experience, it is recommended to read: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cnblogs.com/zh7791/p/11502696.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF Basic Summary (Learning Suggestions)&lt;/a&gt;. The content is not long and is suitable for experienced readers to plan their learning path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For beginners, it is recommended to read: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wpfsoft.com/introduction&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF Chinese Website&lt;/a&gt;, which introduces basic concepts, the development history, and the logical reasoning of underlying classes from scratch. This website happens to be quite lucky ‚Äì the author just released it in August this year, timed perfectly with my content to attract readers to purchase courses. If I waited any later, I‚Äôd probably have no chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most authoritative learning materials, of course, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s official resources are preferred, but they can be a bit dry, and new learners need patience.
Classic electronic books also exist, but they are not recommended; there isn&amp;rsquo;t much time to sit down and read them in daily work, so it‚Äôs more suitable to practice with projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;c-and-net-release-history&#34;&gt;C# and .NET Release History

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain-rise/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: will intensify anti-corruption efforts in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector, and thoroughly rectify ‚Äúthe four prevailing tendencies.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;communist-party-of-china-central-politburo&#34;&gt;Communist Party of China Central Politburo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on September 27, reviewing the Comprehensive Report on the First Round Supervision of the First Session of the Twentieth Party Congress. Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, chaired the meeting. The meeting emphasized that the supervision and oversight work should be used as an opportunity to further strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party in all aspects, urging supervised party organizations to raise their political stance, conscientiously fulfill the responsibilities and missions assigned by the Central Committee, continuously enhance the core functions and competitiveness of state-owned enterprises, consolidate the important material and political foundations of socialism with Chinese characteristics, intensify financial institutions&amp;rsquo; service to the real economy and national strategies, and promote high-quality development. It was stressed to coordinate development and security, firmly establish bottom-line and limit thinking, adopt effective measures to prevent and mitigate major risks, and safeguard the safety line.  It was also necessary to advance comprehensive Party self-discipline to greater depths, consolidate the responsibility of the secretary of theÂÖöÂßî (party committee) as the first person, strengthen the responsibilities of leadership committees members ‚Äúdual duties in one position,‚Äù and enhance the supervision responsibilities of disciplinary and supervisory organizations, highlight strengthening supervision of all levels‚Äô ‚Äúone leader‚Äù, intensify anti-corruption efforts in state-owned enterprises and financial sectors, deeply rectify ‚Äúfour prevailing styles,‚Äù deepen reform, improve systems, promote source governance, and facilitate treatment of problems comprehensively. (Xinhua)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating Major Financial Risks! Liu Liange, former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Merchants Bank, has been expelled from the Communist Party.
According to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision, with the approval of the Communist Party of China, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision initiated an investigation into Liu Liange‚Äôs serious violation of disciplinary and illegal acts as the former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon investigation, Liu Liange lost his ideological conviction, betrayed his original mission, was firm and resolute in implementing the decisions and plans of the Communist Party Central Committee, failed to guard against financial risk prevention responsibilities, recklessly intervened in loan projects and issued loans illegally, causing major financial risks, was ineffective in fulfilling his role as the main body of comprehensive self-discipline of the Party, seriously damaged the political ecology of his unit, privately brought prohibited books into the country, plotted against organizational scrutiny; ignored the spirit of the Eight Rules, accepted gifts and valuables illegally, visited private venues, and received skiing and tourism arrangements; failed to report personal matters in accordance with regulations, did not truthfully explain when questioned by the organization, showed favoritism in appointing and promoting personnel; violated regulations regarding commercial operations; illegally interfered with capital lending, secretly retained confidential materials; was morally corrupt, had an improper family style, failed to properly manage his relatives and educate them; lacked a bottom line of discipline and law, abused power, ‚Äúate from finance,‚Äù used his position for the benefit of others in loan financing, project cooperation, and illegally accepted huge amounts of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu Liange seriously violated the Party‚Äôs political conduct, organizational conduct, integrity conduct, work conduct, and lifestyle conduct, constituted serious disciplinary violations and was suspected of criminal offenses related to illegal loan issuance and fraud, and did not curb or restrain himself after the 18th Party Congress, had a severe and adverse impact, warranted serious handling. In accordance with relevant provisions of the &lt;em&gt;Disciplinary Punishment Code of the Communist Party of China&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Law of the People‚Äôs Republic of China on Supervision&lt;/em&gt;, and after deliberation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision Committee and approval by the Communist Party of China, it was decided to expel Liu Liange from the Communist Party with a dismissal sanction; cancel his benefits in accordance with regulations; terminate his representation in the Nineteenth National Congress; recover illegally obtained income; transfer his suspected criminal issues to the Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office for investigation and prosecution, and related property to be transferred to the Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li Xiaopeng, former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Everbright Bank, has been expelled from the Communist Party and public office due to serious violations and illegal acts (CCTV News).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision reported: According to a report from the Guiyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Zhi Ming, former Party Secretary and Chairman of Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank, was suspected of serious violation of discipline and law and is currently under investigation by the Guiyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-an-eight-year-hiatus-huijin-boosts-holdings-in-four-major-banks&#34;&gt;After an Eight-Year Hiatus, Huijin Boosts Holdings in Four Major Banks
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 11th, Industrial Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and Construction Bank ‚Äì the four major state-owned commercial banks ‚Äì respectively announced that Huijin Company had increased its holdings, totaling 276.1 million shares, 372.7 million shares, 248.9 million shares, and 183.8 million shares, respectively. Huijin Company plans to continue increasing its holdings in the four major banks on the secondary market over the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Revenue Generation Business Model: Raffle/Sweepstakes</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/traffic-monetization-business-model-raffle/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 07:04:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/traffic-monetization-business-model-raffle/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Live streamers sending iPhones? Mini-program ranking rewards? Various live streaming platform gift giveaways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three seemingly unrelated items are, in essence, different monetization models for free traffic ‚Äì a bit like a financial game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;platform-lottery-for-gifts&#34;&gt;Platform Lottery for Gifts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typical scenarios, users reset their acquisition of platform currency and purchase gifts to send to the host, &amp;ldquo;Xin Yi&amp;rdquo; (Hearty), with each platform having another gameplay mechanic. After users acquire platform currency, they no longer directly send gifts but instead spend a certain amount of currency to participate in lottery activities, obtaining limited high-value gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the online lottery is simply understood as the platform opening a casino. With enough participants, it‚Äôs guaranteed not to lose money. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Â±å‰∏ù&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; (literally &amp;ldquo;loser,&amp;rdquo; often used colloquially to describe lower-income individuals) users, fueled by a desire to try their luck and win big, hoping to hit a jackpot and then send gifts ‚Äì gaining face and acting as a ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;live-stream-gifts-physical-items&#34;&gt;Live Stream Gifts (Physical Items)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lottery mentioned previously targets users‚Äô own writing. Each month, the hosts have water flow tasks and popularity tasks. The gameplay of opening gift giveaways allows fans to send specific gifts or gifts of a specified amount, giving them the opportunity to participate in the lottery. The prizes could be high-end phones or cash red envelopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For popular hosts, this activity is very profitable, essentially equivalent to temporary zero-cost purchases. If enough people participate, the host also makes money. This tests the host‚Äôs operational capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s another gameplay where the rewards are very high (cash value), and many outdoor anchors operate in this way, effectively turning it into an online gambling. Users only care about whether they can win, not the content of the live stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from show-type hosts, through PK mode, they induce fans to consume and recharge, and ordinary game anchors cannot drive players‚Äô consumption sentiment. Playing games and watching live streams are both ways to pass the time and don&amp;rsquo;t want to incur additional expenses, especially &lt;strong&gt;competitive games&lt;/strong&gt;. The lottery method can cultivate users‚Äô recharging habits, consumption habits, and occasionally even impulsive spending (sending a lot, hoping to win).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mini-program-ranking-rewards&#34;&gt;Mini Program Ranking Rewards
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design a mini program with some useless workflows or provide partial game-related auxiliary services. The above are all cover stories, designed to pass Tencent‚Äôs audit ‚Äì the mini program‚Äôs gameplay incorporates a ranking mechanism. Users earn points by browsing promotional ads and completing tasks, and the backend sets rankings based on these points, with higher-ranked users receiving designated rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core Logic: Advertising Revenue &amp;gt; Operating Costs + Reward Expenses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mini program can also operate normally by providing reasonable services and earning revenue through appropriate advertising ‚Äì this may not generate much income, but it‚Äôs a steady trickle and is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>ZeroTier VPN</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/zero-tier-remote-lan/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 04:58:03 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/zero-tier-remote-lan/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I recently got a &lt;code&gt;mini&lt;/code&gt; host for the office, thinking it would be convenient to configure an environment and have occasional access at home. I temporarily deployed internal network penetration using &lt;code&gt;frp&lt;/code&gt; ‚Äì specifying port forwarding, which requires a public server with a connection quality dependent on its bandwidth. Instead, I experimented with a fresh &lt;code&gt;Zerotier&lt;/code&gt; virtual LAN, similar to a &lt;code&gt;VPN&lt;/code&gt;, where I created a virtual network card locally and all machines joined it into a single virtual network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-zerotier&#34;&gt;What is ZeroTier
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ZeroTier&lt;/code&gt; is a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) solution that allows users to create secure virtual networks between devices in different geographic locations. Through &lt;code&gt;ZeroTier&lt;/code&gt;, you can easily connect multiple computers, servers, and devices into a virtual, encrypted network ‚Äì as if they were on the same local network. This helps developers and IT professionals securely share data and resources across different locations without complex network setups or VPN configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZeroTier Networks&lt;/strong&gt;: A ZeroTier network is a virtual, global LAN that allows different devices to connect together over the internet, as if they were on the same physical network. This network can contain multiple subnets, with all devices connected through ZeroTier technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planet Servers&lt;/strong&gt;: Planet servers are a key component of the ZeroTier network. They are global and responsible for maintaining and managing the entire ZeroTier network topology, routing information, and network status. The planet server acts as a central control center for the global network, without directly transferring data. User devices need to connect to at least one planet server to participate in the ZeroTier network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transit Servers&lt;/strong&gt;: Transit servers are auxiliary nodes within the ZeroTier network that help establish direct communication channels between devices. When devices cannot connect directly, they can use transit servers to transmit data. This helps improve network reachability and performance. Transit servers are typically located around the world, acting as data transmission hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, ZeroTier uses the assistance of planet servers and transit servers to enable devices to create virtual local networks globally, achieving secure and fast communication between devices. The planet server is responsible for global network management, while the transit server helps devices establish connections when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation--deployment&#34;&gt;Installation &amp;amp; Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the ZeroTier official website (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zerotier.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.zerotier.com/&lt;/a&gt;) to obtain installation files and documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install the ZeroTier One client according to your operating system. It supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and many other platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch the ZeroTier One client after installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register a ZeroTier account if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have one. You can create an account within the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in with your ZeroTier account and create a new network. This network will have a unique 16-character ID, which you need to remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join this network on your device. You can either enter the network ID in the client or use the QR code scanning feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devices installed and configured with the ZeroTier client will be added to the same virtual network. These devices can now communicate directly with each other as if they were on the same local area network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can manage network settings, add devices, and monitor network traffic in the ZeroTier control panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-and-deploying-moon&#34;&gt;Installing and Deploying Moon
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many domestic operators have banned &lt;code&gt;UDP&lt;/code&gt; tunneling, and the &lt;code&gt;frp&lt;/code&gt; service is stable. Due to using the &lt;code&gt;TCP&lt;/code&gt; protocol, deploying &lt;code&gt;Zerotier&lt;/code&gt; intermediate servers can achieve similar effects. The firewall needs to open &lt;code&gt;udp 9993&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;curl -s https://install.zerotier.com/ | sudo bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check installation success:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;zerotier-cli info
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the local network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;zerotier-cli join network-id
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;moon&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;cd /var/lib/zerotier-one &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo zerotier-idtool initmoon identity.public &amp;gt; moon.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit the configuration file, adjust the &lt;code&gt;stableEndpoints&lt;/code&gt; node, &amp;ldquo;server public IP/9993&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate a signature configuration, create the &lt;code&gt;moons.d&lt;/code&gt; folder, move the previous files to this folder, and restart the service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo zerotier-idtool genmoon moon.json
mkdir moons.d &amp;amp;&amp;amp; mv 000000eb444ec0d8.moon moons.d/
systemctl restart zerotier-one.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client nodes join the &lt;code&gt;moon&lt;/code&gt; server, taking the ID from the JSON configuration file&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;zerotier-cli.bat orbit ztaddr ztaddr
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;# Observe whether new moon nodes appear, with IDs and information matching the server configuration
[root@idv-36f9d5 ~]# zerotier-cli listpeers

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Windows platform, start the terminal with administrator privileges and use the &lt;code&gt;zerotier-cli.bat&lt;/code&gt; command-line interface. On the Linux platform, use the &lt;code&gt;zerotier-cli&lt;/code&gt; interface. The &lt;code&gt;listpeers&lt;/code&gt; subcommand displays connected nodes and shows all nodes when using &lt;code&gt;listpeers&lt;/code&gt;, indicating a successful join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uninstalling&#34;&gt;Uninstalling
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to uninstall on the &lt;code&gt;Windows&lt;/code&gt; platform is beyond the scope of this document, as it follows standard operating procedures ‚Äì typically through the Control Panel. We will focus on the &lt;code&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/code&gt; instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the zerotier-one service using dpkg:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo dpkg -P zerotier-one
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete the zerotier-one directory, which stores the address information; deleting it will result in a new address upon reinstallation:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo rm -rf /var/lib/zerotier-one/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were originally all decommissioned, and when the servers arrived, there weren‚Äôt suitable services as proxy nodes. Alibaba was doing sales promotion, providing development trial servers with low configurations, priced affordably in 1999, and used them for two years. What was valued was the bandwidth provided by the servers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>VMware Virtual Machine Disk Space Optimization</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-machine-disk-space-optimization/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:35:41 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-machine-disk-space-optimization/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When installing a development system with VMware virtual machines, it‚Äôs generally recommended to allocate extra disk space. Over time, the local disk space consumed by the VM will far exceed the actual size of its files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scenario-description&#34;&gt;Scenario Description
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;df -h&lt;/code&gt; command revealed that the current machine was using 60GB of disk space, and after deleting all snapshots and clone images, the local virtual machine still occupied significantly more than 60GB, further straining the already limited hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34;&gt;Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When installing the virtual machine, do not select &amp;ldquo;pre-allocate disk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The local hard drive where the virtual machine is stored must have sufficient free disk space greater than the currently used space of the virtual machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there isn&amp;rsquo;t enough space, consider temporarily moving the virtual machine to a portable hard drive, optimize the disk, and then migrate it back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official provides the &lt;code&gt;open-vm-tools&lt;/code&gt; package, which can be installed via yum or by installing the VMware-Tools image package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;commands&#34;&gt;Commands
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;vmware-toolbox-cmd disk shrink /
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After execution, the virtual machine will automatically shut down, and the VMware host program will perform disk compression. The execution time depends on the volume of the virtual machine and the speed of the disk access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect is quite good; the disk space occupied by the virtual machine is essentially equal to the disk information as shown in &lt;code&gt;df -h&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Domestic resources are basically all recommending &lt;strong&gt;Autumn Leaf&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äôs one-click deployment package, thinking that they are open-source projects based on &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;, so deployment wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be very complicated, let&amp;rsquo;s try to start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was messing around with AI-generated images and specifically changed my graphics card, a beginner version of the &lt;code&gt;3060 12g&lt;/code&gt;; the seven-year-old &lt;code&gt;960&lt;/code&gt; retired gloriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core &lt;code&gt;pytorch cuda&lt;/code&gt; installation, which I previously encountered issues with when writing Python game helper scripts (I had installed it locally before), still presented problems ‚Äì the &lt;code&gt;cuda&lt;/code&gt; encryption consistently failed to activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-do&#34;&gt;To Do
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps&#34;&gt;Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step-by-step installation tutorials in Chinese may not be readily available. When you search in English on &lt;code&gt;Google&lt;/code&gt;, you‚Äôll find many similar tutorials starting from scratch. After a brief introduction, we need to install &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and then explain the need to install &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;. Then, you go ahead and download the repository ‚Äì simply double-clicking the script does the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detailed usage and Q&amp;amp;A, consult the &lt;code&gt;issues&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki&lt;/a&gt;. I don‚Äôt know why no one explains what this repository is for. Actually, the name itself isn&amp;rsquo;t difficult to understand ‚Äì it‚Äôs a graphical control console that makes it easier to use. During installation, it downloads the official repository content and obtains the actual &lt;code&gt;SD&lt;/code&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository also provides an installation and startup script that automatically recognizes the current folder and whether there is a &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; virtual environment. If one exists, it defaults to using the Python in the current path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For beginner users, we recommend checking out: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stable-diffusion-art.com/install-windows/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pytorch&#34;&gt;PyTorch
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs what I wanted to talk about today. Don&amp;rsquo;t just follow their steps and run the script directly. Python uses requirement files to install dependencies, which is a minor issue. The core thing is your GPU version and driver version, which need to match PyTorch. Many people have discussed this relationship online ‚Äì you can find it by searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refer to: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40660408/article/details/129896700&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40660408/article/details/129896700&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a virtual environment is like creating an empty virtual environment, where you first execute the official script and install PyTorch within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;python -c &amp;quot;import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;python -c &amp;quot;import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available())&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above two scripts can check the CUDA version you need to install and also check if PyTorch has been installed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not recommended to do fancy operations here ‚Äì just follow the logic on the official page and copy it over directly to install.  Directly using &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; to install PyTorch is likely to fail or won&amp;rsquo;t activate CUDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key point: Don‚Äôt use messy folder names, as this could cause PyTorch to not work correctly. I spent a lot of time installing and reinstalling, trying to upgrade to version 2.0 because the official documentation said it would be faster.  I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used it much before, and wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if Python versions had an impact. I also reviewed the official manual, which recommended using version 3.8. This created a small conflict since I‚Äôd previously used a one-click installation package that contained version 3.10. Finally, I started from scratch by creating a new folder, creating a virtual environment, and ensuring PyTorch was installed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I moved the newly installed virtual environment into the web UI folder.  At this point, running the script to install other dependencies didn‚Äôt cause any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After moving it, you need to execute: &lt;code&gt;python -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall pip&lt;/code&gt; to fix Pip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem a bit strange, but I spent quite a long time troubleshooting this because it couldn&amp;rsquo;t correctly recognize my PyTorch.  I realized that by installing it first, then installing other dependencies, I could eliminate all sources of interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to enable this, which can accelerate image generation and reduce memory usage. However, a side effect is that &lt;strong&gt;generated images are relatively less stable&lt;/strong&gt; with the same set of parameters.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn‚Äôt recommend the one-click deployment package because it contained some settings that were customized by the author and differed from the official, out-of-the-box configuration. If you&amp;rsquo;re a beginner, you might not understand why those parameters are optimal; it‚Äôs generally best to start with the official version. As you use it more and more, take time to read the official documentation, and you‚Äôll learn which parameters need adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gpu-selection&#34;&gt;GPU Selection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the cryptocurrency mining boom, GPU prices have become relatively less high; for entry-level players choosing between the &lt;code&gt;3060&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;3060ti&lt;/code&gt;, it‚Äôs generally recommended to opt for the 12G version of the 3060 due to its larger VRAM, as it can generate larger resolution images. Why do you need a higher resolution? Because you can increase the resolution during generation, which will result in clearer and more detailed images. If you only want to generate small images, then 8GB of VRAM is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs also the &lt;strong&gt;Super Resolution Upscaling&lt;/strong&gt; option, which enhances details and makes the image richer in detail, requiring more VRAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every six months, I originally planned to revisit and refine the installation steps, and explain more basic concepts. However, I discovered that most people using AI image generation are simply adjusting parameters based on images provided by experts, or re-rendering existing images with formatting changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had previously attempted a project using AI to generate UI materials for mini programs, but after struggling for half a day, the results were unsatisfactory compared to just pulling resource images directly from the official mini program documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Program optimization should not attempt to fight against hardware.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/program-optimization-dont-fight-hardware/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;one loop thread&lt;/code&gt;, the time taken has already been at the &lt;strong&gt;microsecond&lt;/strong&gt; level, switching servers resulted in a backlog of up to 60,000 packets, to almost none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In single-threaded loop processing data scenarios, the CPU performance depends on factors such as clock frequency, cache size, and instruction set architecture. Generally, CPUs with higher clock frequencies, larger caches, and more advanced instruction set architectures perform better in single-threaded data processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;single-threaded&#34;&gt;Single-Threaded
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance improvements aren&amp;rsquo;t always achieved by adding threads; it‚Äôs not necessary to overcomplicate things.  Refine the project workflow, identify time-consuming bottlenecks, and determine if a single thread can meet the requirements. Considering single-threaded approaches reduces complexity and minimizes potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs often a bit misguided to jump straight into suggesting threading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Working late into the night to release a new optimized version, local API removal for testing, speed was okay, tps: 42,000
Deployed to server, tps dropped significantly: 21,000, went home to try on a desktop, tps: 79,000, started suspecting that the internal service virtual machines might have some issues, initially suspected frequency-related problems, the difference between the home desktop and the server‚Äôs &lt;code&gt;CPU&lt;/code&gt; is the biggest, namely the frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, regarding core count and clock frequency, the Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4807 @ 1.87GHz has 6 physical cores and 12 logical cores with a clock speed of 1.87GHz; while the Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 v3 @ 2.60GHz has 8 physical cores and 16 logical cores with a clock speed of 2.60GHz. Therefore, from the perspective of core count and clock frequency, the E5-2640 v3 should be more advantageous in single-threaded data processing compared to the E7-4807.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, considering cache size, the E7-4807 has a cache size of 12MB, while the E5-2640 v3 has a cache size of 20MB. Therefore, the E5-2640 v3 possesses larger cache space, which can improve data access speed and cache hit rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, regarding architecture, the E5-2640 v3 utilizes the more advanced Haswell architecture, while the E7-4807 employs the older Nehalem architecture. The Haswell architecture offers performance improvements compared to the Nehalem architecture, which may also influence the E5-2640 v3‚Äôs performance in single-threaded data processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, considering everything comprehensively, in scenarios involving single-threaded loop processing of data, the E5-2640 v3 should exhibit better performance than the E7-4807. However, specific performance differences will be influenced by various factors including data processing algorithms, memory bandwidth, system load, and so on, requiring a case-by-case analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prompt Engineer</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/prompt-engineer/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2023 20:46:53 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/prompt-engineer/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as we needed to learn the techniques of searching engines back then, we also need to learn some techniques for communicating with &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, providing reasonable and sufficient constraints, and efficiently obtaining the answers we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at it from a different angle, current &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; is like a very good student with excellent memory ‚Äì it has the ability to memorize everything. What we need to do is learn how to communicate with &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; correctly, effectively, and precisely describe our needs to help &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; generate the expected results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##ÁßëÊôÆ
The incredibly popular &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; ‚Äì specifically &lt;code&gt;Generative Pre-Training&lt;/code&gt; ‚Äì literally translates to generative pre-training. It‚Äôs a deep learning model that trains text generation based on internet-available data, used for tasks like question answering, text summarization generation, machine translation, classification, code generation, and conversational AI. Currently, there have been various versions of models such as GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4, each larger and more powerful than the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-it-really-have-intelligence&#34;&gt;Does it Really Have Intelligence?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarity is high, accuracy increases accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic, repetitive tasks, after specific training, no longer require human intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is a technology that utilizes existing data such as text, audio, and images to create new content. It can be used for various tasks including text generation, speech synthesis, image generation, and dialogue systems. The logical reasoning of Generative AI depends on its training data and model structure. Generally, Generative AI can follow grammar, logic, and common sense to a certain extent, but it may also produce errors, biases, or unrealistic content. Therefore, the output of Generative AI requires human judgment and verification; it should not be blindly trusted or used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt-engineer&#34;&gt;Prompt Engineer
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time flows only forward, and people need to learn to adapt to the current. You can think of &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; as not intelligent, lacking logic, and often producing unusable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you shift your perspective, the current &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; is like a child with excellent memory ‚Äì it has the ability to memorize after reading something repeatedly, much like copying homework. What we need to do is learn how to communicate correctly, effectively, and with &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, precisely describing our needs to help &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; generate the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dialogue-patterns&#34;&gt;Dialogue Patterns
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, when GitHub Copilot was released, no one could have imagined that two years later, OpenAI would appear out of nowhere, allowing humans to recognize the capabilities of large language models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;strong&gt;comment-based programming&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;conversational programming&lt;/strong&gt;, the interaction logic is completely different. The dialogue pattern is friendly for novice users, and it‚Äôs necessary to mention NewBing providing follow-up prompts after each question. Microsoft is trying to guide users to obtain more content from the AI knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example Scenario
&lt;strong&gt;Scene:&lt;/strong&gt; A long high-speed train journey, coding is a good choice. With limited traffic, processing a few images, obtaining image materials, downloading software to process images is a bit extravagant, and network conditions don‚Äôt allow it.
&lt;strong&gt;Requirement:&lt;/strong&gt; There are a batch of picture materials with transparent background images used as navigation bars for small programs. The selected state is colored, and the unselected state is black and white. The materials are all in color, and they need to be preprocessed.
&lt;strong&gt;Prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; Write a python code snippet to read all pictures from a folder, convert the pictures into black and white, maintain the transparent background, save the pictures, optimize the image quality, reduce file size, and display it in the console, comparing the sizes before and after optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Import necessary libraries
import os
from PIL import Image

# Define a function to convert images to black and white, maintain transparency, save images, and return file sizes
def convert_and_save(image_file):
    # Open the image
    image = Image.open(image_file)
    # Get the image mode, if it&#39;s RGBA mode, indicating a transparent background
    mode = image.mode
    if mode == &amp;quot;RGBA&amp;quot;:
        # Create a white background image with the same size as the original image
        background = Image.new(&amp;quot;RGB&amp;quot;, image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        # Paste the original image onto the white background, ignoring transparent pixels
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
        # Convert the composite image to grayscale mode
        gray_image = background.convert(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
        # Convert the grayscale image back to RGBA mode to preserve transparency
        final_image = gray_image.convert(&amp;quot;RGBA&amp;quot;)
    else:
        # If it&#39;s not RGBA mode, directly convert the image to grayscale mode
        final_image = image.convert(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
    # Get the original image file name and extension
    file_name, file_ext = os.path.splitext(image_file)
    # Define the new image file name with _bw suffix for black and white
    new_file_name = file_name + &amp;quot;_bw&amp;quot; + file_ext
    # Save the new image and optimize quality, reduce file size
    final_image.save(new_file_name, optimize=True)
    # Get the original and new image file sizes and return
    old_size = os.path.getsize(image_file)
    new_size = os.path.getsize(new_file_name)
    return old_size, new_size

# Define a folder path to store all images
folder_path = &amp;quot;images&amp;quot;
# Iterate through all files in the folder
for file in os.listdir(folder_path):
    # Concatenate the full file path
    file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file)
    # Check if the file is an image file based on extension (can add or modify extensions as needed)
    if file_path.endswith((&amp;quot;.png&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.jpg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.jpeg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.gif&amp;quot;)):
        # Call the function to convert and save the image, and get the file size
        old_size, new_size = convert_and_save(file_path)
        # Display the comparison of file sizes before and after optimization in the console
        print(f&amp;quot;{file}: {old_size} bytes -&amp;gt; {new_size} bytes&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; quickly provided an answer, looked very beautiful, and worked well, experienced programmers would find that the code below was not very generic, and couldn‚Äôt be put into production:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No log files, all information is printed to the console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The task of image processing is suitable for a multi-threaded model
&lt;code&gt;NewBing&lt;/code&gt; appeared, based on the prompt, chose a question: &lt;strong&gt;What can be improved in this code?&lt;/strong&gt;
The answer given this time was far beyond expectations, and most programmers would think of optimization measures, &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; gave corresponding suggestions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;This code may still have some improvements, such as:

You can use the argparse library to allow users to specify the folder path and extension through command-line parameters instead of hardcoding them in the code.
You can use the logging library to record the running status of the program instead of printing it directly to the console.
You can use try-except statements to catch potential exceptions, such as file opening failure, image conversion failure, etc., and handle them

## Let&#39;s illustrate with an example

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import argparse
import logging
import multiprocessing
import os

from PIL import Image


# Define a function to convert and save the image, maintaining transparent background and optimizing file size
def convert_and_save(image_file):
    # Open the image
    try:
        image = Image.open(image_file)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f&amp;quot;Failed to open {image_file}: {e}&amp;quot;)
        return None, None
    # Get the image mode; if it&#39;s RGBA, it has a transparent background
    mode = image.mode
    if mode == &amp;quot;RGBA&amp;quot;:
        # Create a white background image with the same size
        background = Image.new(&amp;quot;RGB&amp;quot;, image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        # Paste the original image onto the white background, ignoring transparent pixels
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
        # Convert the combined image to grayscale mode
        gray_image = background.convert(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
        # Convert the grayscale image back to RGBA mode to preserve the transparent background
        final_image = gray_image.convert(&amp;quot;RGBA&amp;quot;)
    else:
        # If it&#39;s not RGBA, directly convert the image to grayscale mode
        final_image = image.convert(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
    # Get the original image file name and extension
    file_name, file_ext = os.path.splitext(image_file)
    # Define the new image file name with _bw suffix for black and white
    new_file_name = file_name + &amp;quot;_bw&amp;quot; + file_ext
    # Save the new image, optimizing quality to reduce file size
    try:
        final_image.save(new_file_name, optimize=True)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f&amp;quot;Failed to save {new_file_name}: {e}&amp;quot;)
        return None, None
    # Get the original image and new image file sizes, and return
    old_size = os.path.getsize(image_file)
    new_size = os.path.getsize(new_file_name)
    return file_name, old_size, new_size

# Define a function to parse command-line arguments and return the folder path and extension list
def parse_args():
    # Create an argument parser object
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=&amp;quot;Convert images to black and white and optimize quality.&amp;quot;)
    # Add a required positional argument, representing the folder path
    parser.add_argument(&amp;quot;folder_path&amp;quot;, help=&amp;quot;The path of the folder that contains the images.&amp;quot;)
    # Add an optional argument, representing the extension list, defaulting to png, jpg, jpeg, and gif
    parser.add_argument(&amp;quot;-e&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;--extensions&amp;quot;, nargs=&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;, default=[&amp;quot;.png&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.jpg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.jpeg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.gif&amp;quot;], help=&amp;quot;The extensions of the image files.&amp;quot;)
    # Parse command-line arguments and return the result object
    args = parser.parse_args()
    return args.folder_path, args.extensions

# Define a function to print the comparison of file sizes before and after optimization
def print_result(result):
    # If the result is not empty, indicating successful conversion and saving
    if result:
        # Unpack the result into a tuple of filename and file size tuple
        if len(result) == 3:
            file, old_size, new_size = result
            # Display the comparison of file sizes before and after optimization in the console
            logging.info(f&amp;quot;{file}: {old_size} bytes -&amp;gt; {new_size} bytes&amp;quot;)
        else:
            # Log the result if it&#39;s not a tuple of 3 elements
            logging.info(f&amp;quot;{result}&amp;quot;)

# Configure the logger, outputting logs to the console and files, setting the log level to INFO
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,
                    format=&amp;quot;%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s&amp;quot;,
                    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler(),
                              logging.FileHandler(&amp;quot;log.txt&amp;quot;)])

# Call the function to get the folder path and extension list
folder_path, extensions = parse_args()

if __name__ == &amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot;:
    # Windows needs this function because Windows lacks the fork() function (not entirely accurate).
    # Therefore, on Windows, forking is simulated by creating a new process, and the code - Additionally, this new process is instructed to run the code passed through a pipe by passing the `--multiprocessing-fork` command-line argument to it.
- If you examine the implementation of the `freeze_support()` function, its task is to check which process it&#39;s running in and whether it should execute the code passed through a pipe.
- `multiprocessing.freeze_support()`

- A process pool is created, automatically allocating processes based on the number of cores on the computer.
- An empty list, `results`, is created to store the result objects of asynchronous tasks.
- The script iterates through all files in the folder:
- The full file path is constructed using `os.path.join()`.
- It checks if the file ends with any of the extensions specified in the `extensions` list (you can modify this list as needed).
- If it&#39;s an image file, the `convert_and_save` function is called to convert and save the image asynchronously, without blocking the main process. The file size is also obtained.  The result object is then added to the `results` list using `pool.apply_async()` with the callback function `print_result`.
- The process pool is closed to stop accepting new tasks.
- `pool.join()` is called to wait for all tasks in the pool to complete.

## Epilogue
Due to local development being on a `windows` system, the first answer given by `AI` did not include the `main` function and also lacked `multiprocessing.freeze_support`. The code was fixed after following up and encountering an error. 
Just as learning the techniques of search engines required skill, we also need to learn how to communicate with `AI`, providing reasonable and sufficient constraints to efficiently obtain the desired answers.
Note: **If you are a programming beginner, if you still don&#39;t understand certain parts of the code based on the given comments, please continue to ask related questions.**&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;WeChat Mini Program Introduction and Development Preparation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-mini-programs-exist&#34;&gt;Why Mini Programs Exist
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; Slow web loading and blank screens; native app experience is faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standards &amp;amp; Management:&lt;/strong&gt; For WeChat, onboarding and management
Before mini programs were released, WeChat published an SDK called &lt;code&gt;JSDk&lt;/code&gt; to open up some of the original WeChat capabilities: WeChat Pay, coupons. However, developers used web development languages to develop logic, bypassing some WeChat regulations. Mini Programs have their own description language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-mini-programs&#34;&gt;What are Mini Programs?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mini programs are applications that can be used without needing to download and install them. They realize the dream of having applications &lt;strong&gt;within easy reach&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can open an application simply by scanning a code or searching for it. This also embodies the concept of &lt;strong&gt;use-it-and-leave-it&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì users don‚Äôt need to worry about installing too many apps.  Applications will be ubiquitous and available at any time, but &lt;strong&gt;without needing to install or uninstall&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;differences-between-mini-programs-and-mobile-applications&#34;&gt;Differences Between Mini Programs and Mobile Applications
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No installation required, doesn&amp;rsquo;t occupy memory, easy to spread: QR code scanning, mini program cards, Search One Search (Sohu Search)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-mini-programs-can-do&#34;&gt;What Mini Programs Can Do
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content Tools: Zhihu Hot Rankings, Weibo Hot Topics, Mobike Bikes, Today Headline, Tencent Maps, Tencent Translate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail: Pinduoduo, JD.com Shopping, Mugujie, Daily Fresh, Xiaomi Mall, Watsons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games: Jump Rope, Happy Mahjong, Happy Dou Dizhu, Duoyue Live Streaming, YY Live Streaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Course content is from 2018; some application vendors have already gone bankrupt now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;development-preparation&#34;&gt;Development Preparation

&lt;li&gt;Register a Mini Program Account: Simply fill in the information normally, and click the activation link on the email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log into the Mini Program Management Backstage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete Mini Program Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bind Developer: For individual developers, use the WeChat account you‚Äôre logged in with as the administrator account; no additional binding is required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email has certain restrictions ‚Äì it needs a new email address, but you can apply aliases for QQ emails, and the WeChat background will not verify them. After trying this, the name of the mini program is quite troublesome. As soon as it involves trademarks, it‚Äôs prone to audit failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can select service categories and also add custom ones; a Mini Program can add five categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Settings, you can view the Mini Program&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;ID&lt;/code&gt; information and enable message push notifications.  Enabling message push allows you to use the Message Template function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;migration&#34;&gt;Migration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closing up shop, packing everything away, a familiar route, a new workstation ‚Äì adjusting computer cabling, finding a comfortable posture to start working.
(√íœâ√ì◊±)! ‚Äì Connecting the network cable, the servers frequently used by the team were inaccessible. I tried switching to wireless networking, and access was normal again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought it was a problem with the server‚Äôs IP address range settings. The wired network at the new workstation wasn&amp;rsquo;t included in the firewall configuration list. After contacting IT colleagues to adjust it, the issue was resolved. This IP address range wasn‚Äôt just for one server; when trying to access other servers, they were all functioning normally. Gradually, I began to feel confused? Let professional people handle professional matters ‚Äì eventually, the operations department colleague identified that this server had &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; deployed, and the default network of the &lt;code&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; service conflicted with the wired network configuration of the office, causing data packets sent to it to not receive responses and being routed to the &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other servers didn‚Äôt have the &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; service deployed, so only this one was affected. I frequently used it, and occasionally used containers to deploy some testing services ‚Äì I never expected to encounter such a scenario. Later, thinking about it in detail, since the entire group was located within the same office building, IT colleagues divided IP address ranges using addresses starting with &lt;code&gt;172&lt;/code&gt;, which wasn‚Äôt unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker0&#34;&gt;docker0

{
    &amp;quot;bip&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;172.200.0.1/24&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart the service and switch to the new network; the server recovers normal access.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Embedded Systems ‚Äì Getting Started Part 1 ‚Äì Technical Terms</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/embedded-entry-professional-terms/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 13:42:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/embedded-entry-professional-terms/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the English translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhen I think of embedded systems, my mind immediately goes back to the 51-pin single-chip microcomputers and Texas Instruments we used in university labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LPA3399Pro is a visual host developed on the HiSilicon RK3399Pro platform, designed for portable computing hosts that require extensive visual computation. It features an integrated NPU compute unit with 3.0 TOPS of processing power and supports various algorithm models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RV1109 is HiSilicon‚Äôs SoC for machine vision within its AI branch, featuring a dedicated NPU. RV1109 provides 1TOPS of processing power.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;system-on-chip&#34;&gt;System on Chip
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoC stands for System on a Chip, meaning ‚Äúchiplet system.‚Äù It‚Äôs a technology that integrates multiple electronic systems onto a single chip. This technology can significantly reduce the size and weight of electronic products while simultaneously improving performance and lowering power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoC (System on a Chip) and CPU (Central Processing Unit) are both important components of computer systems, but they have some distinctions between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPU is the core processor within a computer system, responsible for executing program instructions. It typically only contains basic components such as arithmetic logic units, control units, and registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An SoC, on the other hand, integrates multiple electronic systems onto a single chip, including a CPU, along with other components like memory, graphics processors, and input/output interfaces. This allows for significant reductions in product size and weight while boosting performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the CPU is a component of an SoC, whereas the SoC represents a more complex and highly integrated electronic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;microcontroller-unit&#34;&gt;Microcontroller Unit
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoC (System on a Chip) and MCU (Microcontroller Unit) are technologies that integrate multiple electronic systems onto a single chip, but there are also some differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MCU is a microcontroller, typically containing a CPU, memory, input/output interfaces, and other basic components. It‚Äôs commonly used to control other electronic devices such as household appliances and automotive electronics systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An SoC, on the other hand, integrates more electronic systems onto a single chip, in addition to the basic components of an MCU, it can also integrate other components like graphics processors and wireless communication modules. This significantly reduces the size and weight of electronic products while improving performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, an MCU is a simple microcontroller, whereas an SoC is a more complex and highly integrated electronic system.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AI-assisted programming, the evolution of productivity</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-assisted-programming-productivity-evolution/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 17:05:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-assisted-programming-productivity-evolution/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúGitHub Copilot‚Äù was released less than two years ago, and ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù has appeared. I don‚Äôt fully understand the underlying principles; I&amp;rsquo;ve been using them for a while. The two tools‚Äô levels of assistance are completely different, but they have both achieved a significant increase in productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For things that are too complex, AI still can‚Äôt do it, because they lack logic, or they rely on patterns or fixed frameworks ‚Äì the training data is sufficient, and AI‚Äôs effect is nine out of ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-copilot&#34;&gt;GitHub Copilot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When publishing, I looked at the official introduction‚Äôs ‚Äúdemo‚Äù and found it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very smart. After trying it out, it wasn‚Äôt great, so I gave up on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 2022, when I had some free time, I switched to the new version to try it out, and the effect was already quite good. The only issue was that the speed in China was a bit slow, likely due to network reasons. For languages like &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;, the code generated based on comments was pretty good, and much faster than researching and writing code myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chatgpt&#34;&gt;ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Github Copilot&lt;/code&gt; still focuses on developers, i.e., from a development perspective when designing the product, requiring you to understand how to program and guide AI assistance through comments.
&lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt; has moved to the next level, &lt;strong&gt;allowing non-experts to quickly get started&lt;/strong&gt;.  A conversational chat interface where you can pose questions, describe requirements, and ask for clarification if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example: You know about tokenization but don‚Äôt know how to code, wanting to calculate the similarity of strings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;Python ÂàÜËØçËÆ°ÁÆó Á∂≠Â§©ÈÅãÈÄö LOGORY Âíå ÂêàËÇ•Á∂≠Â§©ÈÅãÈÄö‰ø°ÊÅØÁßëÊäÄËÇ°‰ªΩÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏ ‰∏§‰∏™Â≠óÁ¨¶‰∏≤ÁöÑÁõ∏‰ººÂ∫¶Ôºõ

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, this is Bing. üòä&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to online information 123, Python tokenization can be implemented using the &lt;code&gt;jieba&lt;/code&gt; library. The &lt;code&gt;jieba&lt;/code&gt; library supports three segmentation modes: precise mode, full mode, and search engine mode. You can choose an appropriate mode based on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare two strings, you first need to tokenize them and then calculate their word vectors or edit distance metrics. You can use libraries like NumPy or SciPy for mathematical operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To standardize string processing, converting English to lowercase, you can use Python&amp;rsquo;s built-in &lt;code&gt;lower()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To slice the second string, you can use Python‚Äôs slicing operator [].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a possible code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import jieba
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

# Define two strings
str1 = &amp;quot;Á∂≠Â§©ÈÅãÈÄö LOGORY&amp;quot;
str2 = &amp;quot;ÂêàËÇ•Á∂≠Â§©ÈÅãÈÄö‰ø°ÊÅØÁßëÊäÄËÇ°‰ªΩÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏&amp;quot;

# Standardize the string, convert English to lowercase
str1 = str1.lower()
str2 = str2.lower()

# Find the position of the first character of the first string in the second string
index = str2.find(str1[0])

# If found, slice the second string
if index != -1:
    str2 = str2[index:index+len(str1)]

# Tokenize the two strings using the jieba library
words1 = list(jieba.cut(str1))
words2 = list(jieba.cut(str2))

# Calculate the word vectors of the two strings (using frequency as weights)
vector1 = np.zeros(len(words1))
vector2 = np.zeros(len(words1))

for i, word in enumerate(words1):
    vector1[i] += 1 # Count the number of times each word appears in the first string
    if word in words2:
        vector2[i] += 1 # Count the number of times each word appears in the second string

# Calculate the similarity between the two strings (using cosine distance as an index)
similarity = 1 - cosine(vector1, vector2)

print(&amp;quot;The similarity between the two strings is:&amp;quot;, similarity)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Furthermore, consult the results of running and congratulations, you have discovered a problem. The result is fabricated, it does not actually run the code, but will give you a good result.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question: SQL statement to retrieve records from the product code table where the product code is within the range 80000-89999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;Hello, this is Bing. üòä

According to search result 12, you can use the SQL BETWEEN operator to select values within a given range. The BETWEEN operator includes both the start and end values.

You need to first specify the table name and column name that you want to query, and then use the BETWEEN operator and the range value in the WHERE clause.

For example, if you want to retrieve records from the product code table where the product code is between 80000 and 89999, you can use the following statement:

SELECT * FROM product_code
WHERE code BETWEEN 80000 AND 89999;
Here, &#39;*&#39; represents selecting all columns [3]. If you only want to select specific columns, such as name and price, you can separate them with commas, as shown below:

SELECT name, price FROM product_code
WHERE code BETWEEN 80000 AND 89999;

I hope this helps.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue questioning, negating it: The product code is a string, your code is wrong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;Sorry, I didn&#39;t notice that the product code is a string. If that‚Äôs the case, you need to add single quotes around both ends of the range values, as follows:

SELECT * FROM product_code
WHERE code BETWEEN &#39;80000&#39; AND &#39;89999&#39;;

Please forgive my mistake. üôè

Congratulations, it will recognize mistakes.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Bonded Customs Clearance with Hong Kong Dollar and Renminbi</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hk-rmb-dual-counter/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 20:25:47 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hk-rmb-dual-counter/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing (HKEX) announced on December 13th that it will soon launch the ‚ÄúHong Kong-Renminbi Dual Counter Model‚Äù (hereinafter referred to as ‚ÄúDual Counter Model‚Äù) and dual counter broker mechanisms for its securities markets, further supporting RMB-designated listings, trading, and settlement in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dual-listing-model-and-dual-listing-broker-mechanism&#34;&gt;Dual-Listing Model and Dual-Listing Broker Mechanism
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) stated that the registration procedures for these new measures are expected to begin implementation in the first half of 2023, pending regulatory approval and market readiness. Under the dual-listing model, HKEX will optimize related trading and settlement arrangements, allowing investors to swap securities issued by the same issuer on both the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) and Renminbi (RMB) trading venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance liquidity in the RMB trading venue and narrow the price difference between the two venues, HKEX will introduce a dual-listing broker mechanism. Once relevant legislation is passed by the Legislative Council, market makers engaging in supply activities will be exempt from stamp duty when conducting specific transactions. Simultaneously, these new measures will also prepare for subsequent mainland investors to trade securities priced in RMB through the Hong Kong Connect (HKT) scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe launch of the dual-listing model of Hong Kong Dollar-Renminbi and the dual-listing broker mechanism is a key measure for the development of our market. In conjunction with our other market initiatives, this arrangement will help attract more dual-listing securities to be listed in Hong Kong, complementing the existing mainland products at HKEX. HKEX is committed to actively promoting the internationalization of RMB and continuously enhancing Hong Kong‚Äôs position as a leading offshore RMB center globally.‚Äù  Said Mr. Yao Kai-yan, Chief Operating Officer and Head of Markets at HKEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is noted that the current listing, trading, settlement, and clearing arrangements in the Hong Kong stock market will largely apply to RMB securities under the dual-listing model. HKEX will announce the implementation date of the dual-listing model and the list of eligible dual-listing securities included in the broker mechanism at an appropriate time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-identify-hong-kong-dollar-renminbi-trading-booths&#34;&gt;How to Identify Hong Kong Dollar-Renminbi Trading Booths
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) documentation indicates that the Hong Kong dollar-Renminbi dual listing arrangement will largely follow the existing stock code allocation plan, meaning Hong Kong dollar booths will have stock codes starting with ‚Äú0‚Äù followed by five digits, while Renminbi booths will have stock codes starting with ‚Äú8‚Äù followed by five digits. The last four digits of both Hong Kong dollar and Renminbi booth stock codes will be identical. Renminbi booth stock abbreviations will be appended with &amp;ldquo;-R&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding trading arrangements, based on the fact that securities in both the Renminbi and Hong Kong dollar booths belong to the same category and can be converted into each other, if one booth (such as the Hong Kong dollar booth) allows for short selling of specified securities, the other booth (such as the Renminbi booth) can also be included as eligible for short selling according to exchange rules. Correspondingly, both booths will be listed in the specified securities lists that are available for short selling on the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the stocks in both booths belong to the same category and can be converted into each other, buying or holding the stock in Renminbi while selling it in Hong Kong dollars will be considered a carry trade (short sale), and vice versa. Settlement times between the two booths are T+2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For specified securities eligible for short selling, such as borrowing stocks in Hong Kong dollars and then selling them on the Renminbi booth, this will be treated as a secured short sale, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs worth noting that under the dual booth model, since the Renminbi booth is only for trading and settlement, it will not provide physical stock deposits or withdrawals; physical stocks can only be deposited after being held in the Hong Kong dollar booth and then converted to the Renminbi booth. Similarly, the Renminbi booth must be converted to the Hong Kong dollar booth before physical stocks can be withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Hong Kong settlement and clearing fees, excluding dividend collection service fees and interest collection service fees, will be calculated and charged in Hong Kong dollars. Dividend collection service fees and interest collection service fees will be calculated using the currency adopted for the relevant securities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last year, an SDK was designed to handle encapsulating certain events and provide a class interface externally. During service initialization, the caller implements the corresponding classes and passes the object pointer to the module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with C11 piqued my curiosity, leading me to explore what would happen if these interfaces were implemented using lambda function objects instead of pure virtual function definitions. Compared to the traditional interface definition method, it seemed more flexible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The question arose: with two different syntaxes, which one is faster from a performance perspective? Not understanding compiler principles, I decided to try out some code to find out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Standards Committee established grammatical rules, and at the compilation level, how it‚Äôs implemented depends on each compiler vendor. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that Microsoft‚Äôs compiler is quite powerful here. Syntax sugar isn‚Äôt a panacea; callback interfaces aren‚Äôt abundant, using &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; expressions is more convenient and eliminates the need to define empty callback function interfaces. When callback interfaces become numerous, traditional virtual functions are advantageous for unifying business interface definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; platform, performance is close, with little difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt; platform, a comparison of virtual functions and &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; reveals a 1.35ns overhead per call.
In typical business system development, this level of performance loss can be ignored; introducing &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; brings greater convenience in design. This is particularly noticeable when dealing with multi-signal processing ‚Äì the underlying event triggering mechanism, along with handling functions for logging objects when events are triggered. When more business processing interfaces are needed, &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; objects are stored in a &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;, and they‚Äôre iterated through sequentially during event triggering, similar to Qt&amp;rsquo;s signals and slots; logging, monitoring, business 1, and business 2 are completely decoupled.&lt;/li&gt;

Here are two modes that have been added: a regular function and a functor. They provide an interface callback mechanism and comparison with direct calls, resulting in a qualitative difference in performance loss. Functors perform close to functions, and sometimes even outperform them. The compilation principle is somewhat of a knowledge blind spot; I suspect it&#39;s due to the addresses of accessed variables and the proximity of functions, which benefits `CPU` processing.

Attached is the output from running with `wandbox`.

        <title>Host byte, network byte, observe directly through debugger</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/host-network-byte-order-debugger/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 14:18:12 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/host-network-byte-order-debugger/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the history of computer development, there has been no unified standard for data storage. There are two commonly used rules for byte arrangement. For example, if the low-order bits of a multi-digit number are placed at smaller addresses and the high-order bits are placed at larger addresses, it is referred to as little-endian; conversely, it is called big-endian. In network applications, byte order is a factor that must be considered because different types of machines may adopt different standards, so they are all converted according to the network standard.
According to reading habits, big-endian byte order is more consistent with the left-to-right reading order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;processor-architecturehttpszhwikipediaorgwikie5ad97e88a82e5ba8f&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AD%97%E8%8A%82%E5%BA%8F&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Processor Architecture&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processors such as x86, MOS Technology 6502, Z80, VAX, and PDP-11 use little-endian byte order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processors like Motorola 6800, Motorola 68000, PowerPC 970 use big-endian byte order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The byte order of processors such as ARM, PowerPC (excluding PowerPC 970), DEC Alpha, SPARC V9, MIPS, PA-RISC and IA64 is configurable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;network-byte-order&#34;&gt;Network Byte Order
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network transmission generally uses big-endian byte order, also known as network byte order or network order. The IP protocol defines big-endian as the network byte order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Berkeley&lt;/code&gt; sockets API defined a set of conversion functions to convert 16 and 32-bit integers between network byte order and host byte order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;arpa/inet.h&amp;gt;

uint32_t htonl(uint32_t hostlong); // Converts a uint32_t from host byte order to network byte order
uint16_t htons(uint16_t hostshort); // Converts a uint16_t from host byte order to network byte order
uint32_t ntohl(uint32_t netlong); // Converts a uint32_t from network byte order to host byte order
uint16_t ntohs(uint16_t netshort); // Converts a uint16_t from network byte order to host byte order
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If using &lt;code&gt;asio&lt;/code&gt; as the networking library, its internal namespace provides cross-platform adaptation functions with different names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::host_to_network_long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::host_to_network_short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio-debugger&#34;&gt;Visual Studio Debugger
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In debugging mode, select the Debug menu, Window, and checkmark the Memory window. Within &lt;code&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/code&gt;, you can directly view data in memory using the debugger, as shown in the following image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/host-network-byte-order-debugger/Snipaste_2023-01-10_14-44-00.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ways-to-view-memory&#34;&gt;Ways to View Memory
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The window directly outputs &amp;amp;variable name and jumps to the corresponding variable address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the variable is originally a pointer, double-click on the variable to select it and drag it to the memory window to display the content at the corresponding address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the variable is not a pointer, add it to the calculation window to obtain its address, then manually copy it to the memory window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lets-illustrate-with-an-example&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s illustrate with an example
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receive a data segment, stored in the &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt; object, convert network byte order to host byte order, resulting in &lt;code&gt;body_length&lt;/code&gt; being 30. The server allocates four bytes for transmitting this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;bool NetworkMessage::decode_header()
{
    // Network byte order to host byte order
    body_length_ = boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_long(*(int *)buffer_.data());
    return auto_reserve(body_length_);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

        <pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 13:45:09 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/that-boy-talent-maybe-but-not-much/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs my seventh year in the job, and I‚Äôm not getting as much positive feedback on the code I write. Let me reflect on how I ended up on this &lt;code&gt;coding&lt;/code&gt; path. People‚Äôs choices, especially when they&amp;rsquo;re younger, tend to follow positive reinforcement more closely ‚Äì actively avoiding harm and seeking benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-childhood&#34;&gt;I. Childhood
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving to the city and coming into contact with computer books? Hacker‚Äôs materials? Meeting Windows systems ‚Äì these are all anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The time should be positioned around childhood and sneaking around with my cousin to play games on our parents&amp;rsquo; computer.&lt;/strong&gt; My cousin and I ran a shop with our uncle at the computer store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started having exposure to computers relatively early, and basic understanding was established. Later, in school, taking the microcomputer course also sparked an interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In middle school, I heard about computer competitions, which seemed really cool, but after transferring schools, this fell by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my junior high years, I was familiar with basic computer operations, and I could easily stand out during microcomputer classes. If you‚Äôre still familiar, yes, you&amp;rsquo;ve noticed, it wasn‚Äôt proficiency ‚Äì being familiar with office software would be even more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-moving--relocation&#34;&gt;II. Moving / Relocation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs revisit the moving situation. When we moved to the city center, due to the neighbors, we came into contact with the library. Although we read quite a few novels, we also read a lot of magazines, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computer News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â§ß‰ºóËΩØ‰ª∂&lt;/em&gt; (Greatest Software)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led to an increasingly growing interest in computers as a product. The childhood fascination with hackers was actively pursued through relevant knowledge at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned the basics of operating systems: control panel, CMD commands, VBS scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computer News&lt;/em&gt; is suitable for beginners; each time it explains system operations in the form of case studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greatest Software&lt;/em&gt; recommends various software, industry news, &lt;strong&gt;and of course, game news ‚Äì this was the initial motivation, and it also planted the seed for gaming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-high-school&#34;&gt;III. High School
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, Bo Ge transferred to our class, and &lt;strong&gt;several seniors had been guaranteed admission through computer competitions in the previous two years&lt;/strong&gt;. The school leaders also paid a lot of attention to this competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a prerequisite hardware foundation ‚Äì an alumnus from America donated a building to the school, which resulted in a new library and a new computer lab; it all seemed so coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus Bo Ge‚Äôs popular science lectures, he was considered the computer guru in our class at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scholar + computer expert, knew how to hack into other people&amp;rsquo;s computers and disable classroom surveillance software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-high-school-1&#34;&gt;III. High School
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competitions were bumpy and ultimately ended in the finals, where I didn‚Äôt quite understand the material and the questions were mostly basic algorithms. However, it was still a worthwhile experience ‚Äì like taking a short trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-university&#34;&gt;Four. University
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waiting for university major selection, I chose automation based on my parents&amp;rsquo; recommendation, but I actually wanted to pursue electrical engineering, intending to join the power supply bureau upon graduation. I didn‚Äôt learn much in the courses of my major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My self-driven learning ability was almost non-existent within the major courses; however, I found computer courses within the large curriculum very easy to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended classes for the major course while skipping lectures and diligently studied computer courses. I spent my daily time browsing forums: ‚ÄúJingYi Forum‚Äù (‚ÄúI Love Crack‚Äù),
Combining what I learned from that bit of assembly and C++ knowledge with the skills gained from taking on orders from the forums, I earned more positive feedback and went further and further down this path, unable to be pulled back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the choice of a minor led me to choose writing code for chips, and my parents didn‚Äôt interfere much, letting me make my own decision.
At that time, &lt;strong&gt;the third key figure: my cousin&lt;/strong&gt; had a high education and worked at Baidu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My elder sister understood me and knew that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been focused on research back then, so she encouraged me to talk to my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confirmed the future development path, didn‚Äôt go home during the summer vacation, followed my advisor to work on projects, and gained experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my still-passable grades, I was admitted to Hengsheng Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;five-graduation&#34;&gt;Five. Graduation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a key point I know ‚Äì I learned how to bypass firewalls, took elective courses in Computer Information Retrieval, and quickly found and located information and problems. A valuable colleague, &lt;strong&gt;Mr. [Á°ïÂì•&amp;rsquo;s nickname]&lt;/strong&gt;, appeared at work, gave me time to learn independently, troubleshoot issues down to their roots, and introduced me to the leaders of the R&amp;amp;D center.
These experiences laid the groundwork; in Shenzhen, everyone outside viewed me as exceptionally skilled, successfully leading the transaction channel group.
That‚Äôs where the problem lies: I lacked systematic learning in computer operating systems, algorithms, and software engineering design. All my knowledge was based on my own past experience.
This led to frequent self-doubt regarding my code designs, a lack of guidelines for module design, and ultimately, fatigue after seven years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>China‚Äôs COVID-19 lockdown easing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-coronavirus-end-lockdown/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 19:22:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-coronavirus-end-lockdown/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The policy announcement was incredibly sudden, and its implementation was swift ‚Äì the Health Code QR code was lifted, and checks for green codes in public places ceased. Browsing the Chinese-language version of The New York Times, the entire front page was dominated by discussions about China‚Äôs reopening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t comment on the policies; I‚Äôm simply recording what‚Äôs happening around me. Originally, Beijing had no zero-COVID policy, but the relaxation of restrictions spread rapidly, resulting in widespread infections. Among my friends, none were seriously ill. Shenzhen, bordering Guangzhou, also began to develop quickly. As I write this, with colleagues based in the suburbs of Shanghai, there haven‚Äôt been any large-scale outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back home, the protective measures were minimal, and they spread rapidly. Most people likely experienced a similar feeling ‚Äì suddenly, restrictions were lifted, with new policies announced weekly until a full reopening was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s undeniable that the three years of zero-COVID policy had an effect; we must adapt to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>C11: sleep for vs yield</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/c11-sleep-for-vs-yield/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 20:54:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/c11-sleep-for-vs-yield/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While reviewing the code, &lt;code&gt;std::this_thread::yield()&lt;/code&gt; suddenly popped into my view, a syntax sugar from &lt;code&gt;C11&lt;/code&gt; that I‚Äôd used quite a bit, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt consult the manual; first, I thought it had something to do with asynchronous operations ‚Äì the word was used in the coroutine implementation of the Boost library.  Clearly, it wasn‚Äôt related to coroutines; it‚Äôs about controlling logic within a regular thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;documentation&#34;&gt;Documentation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;yield&#34;&gt;yield
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accuracy of this function depends on the implementation, particularly the OS scheduler mechanism and system state used. For example, the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) real-time scheduler (Linux‚Äôs SCHED_FIFO) will suspend the current thread and place it at the end of the queue for other threads with the same priority that are ready to run (and has no effect if there are no other threads with the same priority).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sleep_for&#34;&gt;sleep_for
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocks the current thread&amp;rsquo;s execution for at least the specified &lt;code&gt;sleep_duration&lt;/code&gt;.
This function may block longer than &lt;code&gt;sleep_duration&lt;/code&gt; due to scheduling or resource contention delays.
The standard library recommends measuring durations using a monotonic clock. If implementing with system time instead, waiting times may be sensitive to clock adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both functions are designed to release the current thread and its associated resources, with the actual effect depending on the platform. I‚Äôm still a bit unclear at this point, so let&amp;rsquo;s run the code to see the execution results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThinkPad laptop (Visual Studio Community 2022), Tencent Cloud S2 Standard Server (gcc8.5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-1&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Execution Platform&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Function&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;First/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Second/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Third/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-2&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Execution Platform&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Function&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;First Time / us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Second Time / us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Third Time / us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-3&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Execution Platform&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Function&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;First/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Second/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Third/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-4&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Execution Platform&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Function&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;First/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Second/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Third/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-5&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the results, it‚Äôs clear that due to differences in operating system implementations, the stability of high-precision sleep varies greatly. If you want high-precision sleep, using &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; is more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time precision is increased to &lt;code&gt;ms&lt;/code&gt;, the difference between the two methods is not significant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linux Server, Reset MySQL Password</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-server-reset-mysql-password/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 14:27:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-server-reset-mysql-password/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an idle Tencent Cloud server that was expiring at the end of the year and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t planned to renew it. So, I decided to deploy a MySQL database for development purposes. When reinstalling the system, I wanted to save time and chose a third-party image provided by Tencent Cloud, which already had MySQL installed. I thought the system should include a Readme file or similar documentation explaining the password and deployment path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tencent Cloud server reinstalled very quickly, taking about a minute. Once logged in, &lt;code&gt;systemctl status mysql&lt;/code&gt; showed that the service was running. I started searching for the password but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it anywhere, and I began to panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I thought, since I had already accessed the server with root privileges, there must be a way to reset the password. I searched through documentation and found a forum post on Alibaba Cloud‚Äôs forum, continuing to tinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reset-password&#34;&gt;Reset Password
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the configuration file &lt;code&gt;vim /etc/my.cnf&lt;/code&gt;, add the following configuration to the &lt;code&gt;mysqld&lt;/code&gt; node: &lt;code&gt;skip-grant-tables&lt;/code&gt;, and execute the command to restart the database: &lt;code&gt;systemctl restart mysql&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, log in directly to the data using &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt;, after which everything will proceed normally. To reset the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; user password and enable allowing remote login simultaneously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;USE mysql;
UPDATE user SET authentication_string = password(&#39;pass&#39;) WHERE User = &#39;root&#39;;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO &#39;root&#39;@&#39;%&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;pass&#39; WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To revert the modified configuration file, restart the database, and you‚Äôre done.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Onomatopoeia of the Night</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/nights-naming-art/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 22:10:14 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/nights-naming-art/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation of the provided text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the vast system of Chinese characters, the character ‚ÄúÂëΩ‚Äù (life/fate) is utterly unique; there isn‚Äôt even a single homophone. Perhaps this subtly suggests that each person‚Äôs life has only one opportunity, cannot be replicated, and cannot be relived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During leisure time, I browsed the rankings on Qidian Chinese Net, and ‚ÄúThe Nomenclature of Nights‚Äù consistently topped the charts with an overwhelming number of monthly votes, far surpassing the second-place book ‚Äì a gap that was truly daunting. For many years, I had primarily read works by well-known authors like Tang Jiaqian and Ergen. This time, I decided to try a new author‚Äôs work and experience a different reading sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of early August, ‚ÄúThe Nomenclature of Nights‚Äù had amassed a staggering two million monthly votes, while the second book only garnered eight hundred thousand ‚Äì the disparity was astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge my own lack of knowledge and ability to critically evaluate the author&amp;rsquo;s writing style. However, after reading through more than fifteen chapters, I found that the plot was tightly woven and intricately connected, captivating and engaging. Given such high monthly vote numbers, it‚Äôs undeniably well-deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, just like ‚ÄúÂëΩ,‚Äù the character ‚ÄúÊ≠ª‚Äù (death) also has no homophones within the Chinese character system. Does this similarly imply a unique and irreplaceable depth regarding the end of life?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Brief Overview of Automated Testing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/automated-testing-overview/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 11:39:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/automated-testing-overview/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The investment in testing for financial trading systems far exceeded that of other systems, with tedious test steps repeatedly executed and a low &lt;code&gt;ROI&lt;/code&gt;. As projects and personnel changed, uncontrollable factors inevitably introduced, a common situation being the modification of a field output from Interface A impacting the results of Interface B. With each version release, risk also accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theoretical-knowledge&#34;&gt;Theoretical Knowledge
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Measure the Value of Automation?&lt;/strong&gt;
An automation testing ROI = (Manual Execution Time) * (Number of Runs) / (Development Cost + Maintenance Cost)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Features Should Be Automated?&lt;/strong&gt;
Frequently used features that are unlikely to change. Writing automated test code for this type of interface yields the highest returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Choose This Timing to Drive Automation Testing?&lt;/strong&gt;
Not appropriate near project launch ‚Äì distant water doesn‚Äôt quench immediate thirst; automation is a long-term return model. It&amp;rsquo;s most suitable when the project is already in a &lt;strong&gt;production environment&lt;/strong&gt; and within a stable release cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;framework-selection&#34;&gt;Framework Selection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the task of automation testing without prior practical experience, a typical starting point is to open a search engine and find tools and frameworks that can be used with the current system‚Äôs &lt;strong&gt;technology stack&lt;/strong&gt;, review the user manuals, and get started. If you can immediately find a suitable tool, congratulations, &lt;strong&gt;perfect start&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this by saying I might be wrong. After reviewing relevant materials, it&amp;rsquo;s not that these frameworks don‚Äôt exist; rather, they are too complex and consume excessive resources. For beginners, what‚Äôs needed is something small, streamlined, and concise. Consulting with colleagues in the testing group led to the suggestion of a &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; self-built framework ‚Äì essentially, wrapping existing unit testing frameworks into an automated testing framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referencing the design thinking for this project: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/wintests/pytestDemo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/wintests/pytestDemo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-use-a-framework&#34;&gt;Why Use a Framework?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Services have multiple different deployment environments ‚Äì development, testing, and live testing environments. The purpose of a framework is to act as an abstraction layer, separating test cases and data. This allows for configuring different case data according to various environment configurations, and it also supports shared data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core logic is focused on increasing the utilization of automation. When scenarios become more complex, the data between different environments is completely unrelated and has no bearing on each other. Simply add a &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; tag when specifying case data to indicate the supported environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 11:27:30 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/why-learn-a-new-language/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting from my academic years, I‚Äôve been working with &lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; for over ten years. So, why do I need to learn other programming languages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work experience: Lacking experience in elegant module design, &lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; syntax is freeform. Learning other languages helps me guide the development of more elegant designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often use them when writing some tools. The design principles for low-level libraries and business modules are also becoming clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visual Studio Compilation Character Set [Converted]</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-character-set/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 10:51:43 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-character-set/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; cross-platform development. Commonly encountered on Chinese operating systems: &lt;code&gt;error C2001&lt;/code&gt; - constant contains a newline character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio&#34;&gt;Visual Studio
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmake&lt;/code&gt; organizes the project compilation script, generating a temporary solution under the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; system for development. The reason for cross-platform compatibility is that the file encoding is chosen as &lt;code&gt;utf-8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cited reference provides a detailed explanation of the causes of the problem from first principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding encoding, &lt;code&gt;MSVC&lt;/code&gt; has dedicated compilation options &lt;code&gt;/source-charset&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/execution-charset&lt;/code&gt;. The former indicates the encoding of the file itself, and the latter indicates what encoding the byte array inside the compiled character set is. Encoding issues can basically be solved using these two options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt; console defaults to displaying &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt; encoding. However, the code file itself is &lt;code&gt;utf-8&lt;/code&gt;. Because of cross-platform considerations and it&amp;rsquo;s inconvenient to directly convert it to &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt;, we don‚Äôt include the method of writing encoding conversion code for different platforms. On &lt;code&gt;Win10&lt;/code&gt;, we can set these compilation options to &lt;code&gt;/source-charset:utf-8 /execution-charset:gbk&lt;/code&gt;, indicating that the compiler reads in with &lt;code&gt;utf-8&lt;/code&gt; encoding and then converts it to &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt; to store in the array, so &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; can display Chinese characters normally in the &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt; console.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pelosi Visits Taiwan</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t know politics, don‚Äôt make comments, record this ‚Äúcarnival‚Äù on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;musings&#34;&gt;Musings
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Tangshan Assault Incident&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Primary School Textbook Cultural Invasion Incident&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì I wonder how many people even remember them anymore. These trending news stories have become numbingly commonplace, without much feeling, and I just watch TV as usual after work, observing the spectacle. The economic situation is already dire; a war wouldn‚Äôt make things any better.  I don&amp;rsquo;t understand politics or offer commentary, simply recording this internet-fueled ‚Äúcarnival.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wiki-overviewhttpszhwikipediaorgwiki2022e5b9b4e58d97e8a5bfc2b7e8a3b4e6b49be8a5bfe8a8aae5958fe58fb0e781a3&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E5%B9%B4%E5%8D%97%E8%A5%BF%C2%B7%E8%A3%B4%E6%B4%9B%E8%A5%BF%E8%A8%AA%E5%95%8F%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Wiki Overview&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nancy Pelosi visit to Taiwan, also known as the Pelosi visit to Taiwan, refers to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs 2022 visit to Asia, specifically her itinerary which included a stop in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the U.S. House Speaker being considered the third-highest official in the United States and plans to visit Taiwan, the date was approaching shortly before the Chinese People&amp;rsquo;s Liberation Army&amp;rsquo;s (PLA) 70th Founding Day on August 1st, and long-term it approached the Communist Party of China‚Äôs Twentieth National Congress, the 2022 U.S. elections, and the 2022 Taiwan local elections. The government of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China issued a strong protest, dispatching destroyer task forces to the northeast waters of the Taiwan Strait and mobilizing the Shandong and Liaoning aircraft carrier strike groups, with the Eastern Theater Command and Southern Theater Command conducting large-scale live-fire exercises in the East Sea and South China Sea respectively. On the U.S. side, the Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier strike group arrived around the Taiwan Strait to guard Pelosi‚Äôs possible visit itinerary, and multiple waves of reconnaissance aircraft and aerial refueling tankers were deployed on standby at Japan&amp;rsquo;s Camp Hikawa Air Base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden had a video meeting before the visit, which covered the issue of Taiwan. Taiwanese and international media reported that Speaker Pelosi and the House delegation would arrive at Songshan Airport in Taipei on the 2nd, stay overnight, and meet with Taiwan‚Äôs Presidential Office level officials including President Tsai Ing-wen on the 3rd. Some analysts believe this visit could potentially lead to a new crisis in the Taiwan Strait, similar to the 1996 Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis, after 26 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;08-11&#34;&gt;08-11
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By today, this has pretty much settled down. During this time, the headlines were dominated by various naval exercises, and Zhihu was putting in a lot of effort to update its trending charts every day, talking about all of this. Let the reporters work hard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Quickly calculate folder size on the Windows platform</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-platform-quick-folder-size-statistics/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 19:54:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-platform-quick-folder-size-statistics/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Linux platform is very simple: &lt;code&gt;du -sh *&lt;/code&gt; ‚Äì just one line of code solves the problem. What about Windows? With many disks and a desire to clean up, with numerous files, the system‚Äôs built-in Resource Manager is too slow to calculate folder sizes, making you want to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;everything&#34;&gt;Everything
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers working on the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; platform, you probably haven&amp;rsquo;t personally used &lt;code&gt;everything&lt;/code&gt;, and should at least have heard of it. Its search speed far exceeds that of the built-in file explorer. Given that system-level support for fast indexing exists, we can certainly find similar tools that build file indexes while also calculating file sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wiztree&#34;&gt;WizTree
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Website: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.diskanalyzer.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.diskanalyzer.com/&lt;/a&gt;
Use the standard installation method or the green version to unzip and run.
It‚Äôs fast, with a wide variety of data display types ‚Äì the left side features a tree diagram mode, the right side displays file types, and there&amp;rsquo;s also graphical visualization available at the bottom of the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spacesniffer-update-2023-no-longer-maintained&#34;&gt;SpaceSniffer (Update 2023 No Longer Maintained)

    &gt;http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation is very simple ‚Äì select the corresponding drive letter, and the software will display folder sizes in a graphical way, with larger volumes resulting in larger matrices in the images.  Other operations are easily understood by simply clicking on them. It supports inputting filter conditions for files:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Copy Webpage Stylesheets (CSS): Element Inspector</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-copy-webpage-css-element-inspect/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 23:36:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-copy-webpage-css-element-inspect/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Static blog themes, the mainstream is based on foreign templates, modified and adjusted without much consideration for Chinese content layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half a month ago, I adjusted the blog‚Äôs stylesheet ‚Äì as I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing backend services for many years, I‚Äôm a pure newbie in frontend. After struggling with it for half a day, the design wasn‚Äôt quite reasonable. Suddenly an idea struck me: I looked at the technical blogs I often read ‚Äì infoq and OpenChina ‚Äì and their layouts look really good. Could I borrow some of those? After reviewing the source files, I got lost trying to locate the relevant elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontend developers might be laughing at this point‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt understand how to locate the specified elements, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay; I have plenty of free time on weekends, so I stopped and thought about it. It reminded me of when I wrote Python crawlers ‚Äì I had used something similar before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;element-inspection&#34;&gt;Element Inspection
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs the browser&amp;rsquo;s built-in element inspection tool ‚Äì copying stylesheets, locating specific elements, all done in minutes. &lt;code&gt;selector&lt;/code&gt; to locate elements, &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; to create a ‚Äúuser define css‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy outerHTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy selector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy JS path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy styles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy XPath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy full XPath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Editing Extremely Large Files on the Windows Platform: EmEditor (Text Editor)</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai GuoAn database incident, which caused a huge stir within the black hacking circles, remains unclear whether it‚Äôs true or false. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what we remember in two years and look back on it then. Based on past experience, I updated a batch of local social engineering databases, and I encountered a massive SQL file: 17.9G. A regular text editor couldn&amp;rsquo;t even preview it, let alone open it. Chatting with netizens, someone mentioned EmEditor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Website: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.emeditor.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.emeditor.com/&lt;/a&gt;
I took a look at it over the weekend and found it quite convenient. The design supports editing large files, and when sufficient memory is available, the entire file is loaded into memory, resulting in fast search and editing speeds. It also supports splitting files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Shanghai Fen Yong Guo (Shuang Yang Pot) Lockdown</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-sealed/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 23:03:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-sealed/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The leadership team insisted for two days that Shanghai wouldn‚Äôt be locked down, that Shanghai was important. But in the end, facing the reality or to preserve their own prestige, they came up with a strategy of closing across the Huangpu River first for a period of time, and then locking down this side of the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lockdown&#34;&gt;Lockdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I experienced the SARS epidemic and have very little memory of it. After seeing related materials, it ended because its incubation period was short and there wasn‚Äôt a nationwide spread yet. I remember being in primary school back then, with classes ending early every day, and the smell of disinfectant always lingering in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 has been raging for almost three years. Workers who travel abroad have become accustomed to it, wearing masks when they need to. The recent wave of outbreaks in Shanghai has repeatedly fluctuated, originating from Hong Kong and then spreading across the border into Shenzhen, and here in Shanghai was due to a surge of imported cases from Hong Kong. The official announcement stated that the spread of the epidemic was caused by inadequate protection measures at quarantine hotels, and the mutated virus had reduced its toxicity but increased its transmission speed through ventilation systems in hotels. Initially, it wasn‚Äôt very serious and could be contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are often confident. Shanghai&amp;rsquo;s leaders were like that too. They would choose to implement grid-based risk control with us for precise containment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lockdown-1&#34;&gt;Lockdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can all see from the results, the new cases have already exceeded 20,000, leaving us with no choice but to implement a lockdown. Notably, it didn‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù externally, as it had previously stated during a press conference that Shanghai did not need a lockdown, in order to preserve its last shred of face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grocery-shopping&#34;&gt;Grocery Shopping
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delivery industry is a new emerging sector driven by the internet. The core of it relies on someone delivering groceries for you, right? However, due to widespread lockdowns in many areas during the pandemic, merchants could operate but no one was available to deliver, which removed the final link in the chain. People outside of this may not fully understand ‚Äì how could a cosmopolitan metropolis like Shanghai, with its residents going everywhere, all rush out to buy groceries together en masse? In reality, most people are also migrant workers who come here to work and live in rented apartments, typically eating at company canteens or restaurants, rarely cooking at home. When this route becomes blocked, those with the means will start buying groceries. Because this lockdown announcement was not made in advance, people didn&amp;rsquo;t have much food or vegetables stored up, which led to the chaotic rush to buy groceries seen in the video. In that situation, gathering together directly resulted in a resurgence of the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;industry&#34;&gt;Industry
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of us are working in the IT industry. I experienced the impact of the pandemic, getting a taste of remote work. Back in 2019, I stayed at home for almost a month, changing my train tickets back and forth ten times, with no certainty about when I would be able to return to Shenzhen.  I can‚Äôt even imagine how those people in the catering, tourism, or many service industries have been getting by these past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When you want to make money</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/when-you-want-to-make-money/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 03:23:53 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/when-you-want-to-make-money/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ordinary people are social animals, that‚Äôs right ‚Äì you are an individual, and also a bipedal animal, with strong social attributes; you have feelings of inferiority and vanity, and society is constantly changing and eroding your &lt;strong&gt;everydayness&lt;/strong&gt;. We don&amp;rsquo;t discuss those great figures, those who willingly burn themselves for society or the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-current-situation&#34;&gt;My Current Situation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at average salaries or my hometown wages, my current income is significantly above the average ‚Äì what‚Äôs there to be dissatisfied with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you earn one million, you start thinking about earning one hundred million; once you earn one hundred million, you start thinking about earning a billion. This is natural for ordinary people; we must face our inner selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-current-situation-1&#34;&gt;My Current Situation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs red are the more relaxed ways to make money: short videos. Everyone knows it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to enter an industry. What you see is short video content, but you don‚Äôt see the behind-the-scenes work of filming and copywriting. But everyone has their own dream ‚Äì I‚Äôm suited for that industry, I was born to be in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting Started
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve watched so many videos. If you analyze a lot of the shots with your own mind, you can clearly see professional editing techniques and strong cinematic elements. Basically, some of them are from people who have formal training ‚Äì film school graduates, for example. Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s also the logic of grassroots success, but that doesn‚Äôt apply to most people, does it?
On TikTok, you‚Äôll also find many videos teaching you how to make videos. At this point, people are starting to wake up. If they could really make money, why would they teach others how to do it instead of doing it themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anti-human-recommendation-algorithms&#34;&gt;Anti-Human Recommendation Algorithms
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the Douyin algorithm would recommend movie clips and anime clips while I was scrolling ‚Äì you‚Äôd start to find them interesting. However, when I looked into how Douyin makes money, it started recommending various tutorial videos non-stop, flooding my entire recommendation stream. As someone in the IT industry myself, I began to feel that the ‚Äúbig brothers‚Äù behind these algorithms were having a bit of a problem ‚Äì you recommend like this, are you thinking I‚Äôm stupid or are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; stupid? Crucially, they keep finding new ways to recommend videos on how to make money with Douyin, covering different angles and various types. It&amp;rsquo;s as if they&amp;rsquo;re constantly trying to figure out the most effective way to exploit my time. I started wondering how long this business model could last, and how much time they could drain from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-clarity&#34;&gt;Finding Clarity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When teaching people how to do things, presenting a set of rules for them and then being unable to control yourself when doing it is ridiculous. As I‚Äôm not a purely technical blog writer, I haven&amp;rsquo;t published some things domestically, so here I casually rant. If one day I get banned, that can only be said to move somewhere else. I can‚Äôt say I haven‚Äôt done anything with Douyin ‚Äì at least now it actively cooperates in the dissemination of real-time news and the propaganda of national policies, because in our country, you can&amp;rsquo;t defy the Communist Party, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now think back to when you were studying. When you truly can‚Äôt find the meaning of life, quietly reading a book is enough. In this era, how many people can still quiet their minds and quietly read books?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also want to thank the progress of science and technology. If you‚Äôre seeing this line, you‚Äôll realize that the entire manuscript is very colloquial. And I really just kept writing and writing it. The input method I usually used was Sogou Input Method, which I&amp;rsquo;d been using for about seven or eight years. However, when it came to voice input, it had to be said that Xunfei was more professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the article number was changed to 002. Why did it have two zeros? There‚Äôs a dream ‚Äì this year I wanted to break the hundred articles, which is just a dream, right? It&amp;rsquo;s not really articles; it‚Äôs more like records. I reflect on myself every day, and you must be able to think of some things, right?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adding a code copy button for seemingly simple things</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/add-copy-button-for-simple-task/</link>

        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent four hours on this, and when I saw the sentence, it was hilarious. How could it have taken so long? Finally looked at the time: three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first draft of the year 2022, and it wasn‚Äôt complicated ‚Äì exactly as the title said. (At that time, I was still quite young), I thought simply copying &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ouuan.github.io/post/from-hexo-to-hugo/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;‰Ωú‰∏ö&lt;/a&gt; would be enough, putting it in my favorites folder, and letting it sit for over a month before finally remembering the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When migrating to &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;, I always felt that the plugins were too few, couldn‚Äôt copy code, which made copying notes from Evernote to the blog very cumbersome, seriously hindering my motivation for writing a casual blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword&#34;&gt;Foreword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, carefully read the original author‚Äôs draft, read it through completely and flip through their introduction. Wow, I ran into a big shot ‚Äì Tsinghua University undergraduate, has been exposed to computers since early on, huh? Just a facade, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at this blog first, completely forgot what he was supposed to do. Also, check out the author‚Äôs &lt;code&gt;Github&lt;/code&gt; repository; this modified ‚Äòeven‚Äô theme is much prettier than now and has more features, let‚Äôs get started, merge the relevant code into it.

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect is still good, and you can experience it by dragging it to the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before taking action, I didn‚Äôt carefully examine the author&amp;rsquo;s original repository history, assuming a simple merge would fix everything.  Ultimately, I merged a huge amount of code with numerous conflicts and N times of manual overrides ‚Äì all of which were frontend and rendering template code, using the one that matched my requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repository Address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TianlongXiang/hugo-theme-even&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese pitfall: if &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; doesn‚Äôt adjust this parameter, it will cause the generated link to not be able to obtain the current article&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;commit hash&lt;/code&gt;, resulting in history link generation failure.  When generating the complete historical record of the article, you also need to modify the automatic integration script and remember to pull the entire historical record of the current repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust website content width, the previous design was suitable for both mobile and desktop devices; in reality, no one actually viewed it on their phones, and I personally view it on my computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The directory bar should support automatic expansion/contraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;body&#34;&gt;Body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referenced &lt;code&gt;ouuan&lt;/code&gt;‚Äôs code records for half an hour or so, and still couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite understand how to increase the copy button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time travel, a month later, it came back to this matter again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I didn‚Äôt understand this assignment, I switched to copying from another source ‚Äì it was definitely easier to grasp. The results of my search were surprisingly helpful; a forum post on the official &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; website detailed how to add a copy button. After checking it out, I realized that the code block styles generated by &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; differed from the descriptions in the documentation ‚Äì this part was quite complicated. So, I‚Äôm just going to record this for reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand front-end development, when I encounter something I don‚Äôt get, I open my browser‚Äôs ‚ÄúInspect‚Äù tool and analyze the code alongside the style information on the right; I use JavaScript logs to help me understand the logic. There were many things I didn‚Äôt understand at first. Taking a deep breath and carefully breaking down the logic helped me find a solution eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; nodes are multiple, this refers to a single code block. The theme itself rendered line numbers, which resulted in the copy button appearing twice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to disable the theme‚Äôs built-in code highlighting; unfortunately, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the settings for this theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I consulted the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; website and read some documentation ‚Äì it was a bit confusing at first, but I learned that the &lt;code&gt;markup&lt;/code&gt; setting could control code highlighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I adjusted the configuration file, but it didn‚Äôt work; the rendered output differed from my expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I discovered this bunch of settings called &lt;code&gt;pygmentsOptions&lt;/code&gt;, so I continued to consult documentation and adjust the settings, first removing the line numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I configured a custom CSS stylesheet and a custom JavaScript script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since I‚Äôd already done so much, my brain suddenly remembered seeing a nice color palette recently, so I modified the button styles: Let&amp;rsquo;s go with the traditional Chinese sky blue!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;special-img-class&#34; style=&#34;width:20%&#34; src=&#34;2022-02-25-02-01-22.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;special-img-class&#34; style=&#34;width:20%&#34; src=&#34;2022-02-25-02-01-33.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent four hours on this, and when I saw that sentence, I even found it funny ‚Äì how could it take so long? Finally, I looked at the time: It was only three hours.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What we have been seeking throughout our lives is‚Ä¶</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/what-we-seek-throughout-life/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 21:09:58 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/what-we-seek-throughout-life/</guid>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang Yi-zi said: Human relationships, spanning a lifetime of mutual support and dependence, may be held within one‚Äôs embrace, understood in the confines of one room; or they may arise from entrusted messages, dissolving into the vastness beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a lifetime, like a fleeting flower. Like grass and trees blossoming and withering, like the rising and setting of the sun and moon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, in this life, desires are numerous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a child, I lay under lotus plants and hemp in the stream, busy catching the east wind to fly kites, chasing yellow butterflies in haste,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also learned to grow gourds by the shade of mulberry trees, returning home with a full meal after dusk, not shedding my cloak to lie beneath the moonlight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I grew older, I hoped to be inscribed on the gold list, to have a beautiful woman accompany me, to have endless wealth, to rise continuously, to have a full table of guests, to sing and play every night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When old, I wanted health and longevity, welcome childhood servants, young children waiting at the door, a chessboard, a confidant, a bottle of wine, a courtyard, enjoying family harmony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see people rushing about in a panic, only seeking a few taels of broken silver. Yet, this broken silver, can it dispel all kinds of melancholy in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Half the people are still struggling with their lives, where do they have time to seek meaning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, human life is just an experience, like plants, sun and moon ‚Äì experiencing the cycle of desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don‚Äôt understand it, you‚Äôll feel like a fleeting moment in the vastness of the world, a tiny grain of sand on the Yangtze River. When you understand it, you‚Äôre happy with what you encounter, temporarily possessing yourself, content and self-sufficient, unaware of your approaching old age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can pursue wealth and fame, or poetry, wine, flowers, and tea. You can pursue the clear breeze on the river or the bright moon in the mountains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But don‚Äôt overly concern yourself with the results; they will all eventually pass away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a lifetime of hardship, when you arrive in this world, try to experience the joys and sorrows, birth, old age, sickness, and death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really like the quote from The Tale of the Sea Deer:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lives are short, and we will eventually lose them, so why not be a little bolder ‚Äì love someone, climb a mountain, chase a dream ‚Äì there are many things with no answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I greatly enjoyed &lt;em&gt;The Analects of Zan Gong&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Red Cliff&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the rise of past generations, one feels a sense of longing; if only they could be brought together as one, never to have lamented or mourned, unable to convey it within my heart. I know that dying in one‚Äôs lifetime is an absurdity, and the tragedy of Zang and Peng is a false fabrication. Those who look upon us now are like we look upon them then. Alas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Fidelity Securities case, it‚Äôs possible to analyze and implement the conversion rules are fixed through coding.

        <title>Lost/Confused</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/lost-and-confused/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 18:01:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/lost-and-confused/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, at some stage of life, people find themselves in a state of confusion, not knowing what they truly want, and gradually losing their pursuit of the meaning of work amidst the mundane daily routines. Looking back to when I first graduated, my heart was full of fervent aspirations ‚Äì then I would without hesitation say, ‚ÄúI yearn to write code, to create brilliant, eye-catching code.‚Äù However, working until today, I‚Äôve had more exposure to business-level affairs, which is largely due to the benefits brought by industry development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of my lifestyle, I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet included marriage and having children, or establishing a family, in my thinking; my mind is almost blank, only focused on enjoying the present moment. Whenever weekends arrive, I enjoy quietly playing games, often spending an entire day staying at home, immersed in my own little world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life, we always need something we truly love and dedicate ourselves to wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buying-a-house&#34;&gt;Buying a House
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I was full of enthusiasm and planned to save diligently to buy my own property. I meticulously budgeted every day towards this goal. However, as house prices continued to rise, I transitioned from initial anxiety and disappointment to eventually becoming numb, gradually feeling that even if I bought a house, it would simply be a heavy burden I‚Äôd been carrying around ‚Äì ultimately leading me to abandon the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;saving-money&#34;&gt;Saving Money
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, saving money was about achieving some small goals, such as building a high-performance desktop computer, purchasing a long-desired camera, or taking an impromptu trip. However, now I approach saving with a more relaxed and ‚Äúchill‚Äù attitude, no longer worrying too much about daily expenses ‚Äì I indulge in things I want to eat and boldly try new and exciting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;returning-home&#34;&gt;Returning Home
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I realized that what I most longed for deep down was simply to go home. There wasn‚Äôt anything particularly to do, just returning to that familiar place, feeling the warmth and tranquility of home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Hong Kong Futures Basic Concepts</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-futures-basics/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 10:54:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-futures-basics/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As financial markets continue to evolve, investors have begun seeking more effective investment tools to enhance their investment returns. To meet investor demand, The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has launched a range of stock futures contracts, all of which represent stocks listed on its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), which boasts high trading volumes and active liquidity. Through investing in stock futures, investors can participate in the performance of individual companies while also benefiting from the short selling and leverage effects offered by the derivatives market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the underlying stocks represented by stock futures are typically leading companies within their respective industries, investors can strategically select to invest in those industry-specific futures if they believe a particular sector‚Äôs performance will outperform or underperform the overall stock market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-definition&#34;&gt;Basic Definition
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stock futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specified quantity of financial value (contract size) equivalent to a specified number of shares (the underlying stock) at a predetermined price (the agreed-upon price) on a future, specified date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All stock futures contracts are settled in cash and do not involve the physical delivery of shares upon expiration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contract-expiry&#34;&gt;Contract Expiry
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon contract expiry, the profit or loss amount is calculated as the difference between the agreed-upon price and the final settlement price multiplied by the contract multiplier, which will be deducted from the clearing member‚Äôs margin account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final settlement price refers to the official closing price of the stock reported by the Shanghai Stock Exchange on the last trading day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a futures investor wishes to close out their position before expiry, a short seller only needs to buy back one futures contract, while a long position holder must sell one futures contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;margin-deposit&#34;&gt;Margin Deposit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In futures trading, both buyers and sellers must initially deposit a basic margin as collateral to fulfill the contract. After each daily settlement, the clearing organization calculates profits or losses for all open contracts based on the closing market price and uses this to deduct from investors‚Äô margin accounts. If unfavorable market conditions result in an investor incurring losses that cause their margin to fall below the specified level, the exchange will require the investor to top up their margin within a designated timeframe to maintain it at the original basic margin level (i.e., to cover).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advantages&#34;&gt;Advantages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Transaction Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; The fees are low relative to the value of the underlying shares. Each futures contract is equivalent to thousands of shares, and commissions depend on the number of contracts traded, resulting in a very low cost per unit of value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier Short Selling:&lt;/strong&gt; Because investors can easily short stocks through futures contracts, they can profit during market declines by shorting stock futures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Maker System:&lt;/strong&gt; To ensure market liquidity, The Hong Kong Exchange &amp;amp; Clearing Limited (HKEX) mandates that market makers provide buy and sell prices within a specified range, maintaining circulation in the stock futures market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Investors only need to pay a margin representing a small portion of the contract value when buying and selling stock futures contracts, making hedging and trading more cost-effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Foreign Investor Currency Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Stock futures contracts provide foreign investors with access to invest in high-quality local stocks because they only pay a margin instead of the full contract value, significantly reducing the currency risk borne by foreign investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Trading System:&lt;/strong&gt; Stock futures contracts are traded through The Hong Kong Exchange &amp;amp; Clearing Limited‚Äôs (HKEX) electronic trading system. All trades are executed according to price and time priority, with immediate display of buy prices, sell prices, and transaction prices, achieving the highest level of market transparency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clearing Company Performance Guarantees:&lt;/strong&gt; Stock futures contracts will be registered, settled, and performance guarantees provided by HKEX‚Äôs wholly owned subsidiary, Hong Kong Futures Clearing Limited (the Clearing Company). Because the Clearing Company is the counterparty to all unsettled contracts, participants in the clearing house will not have to bear counterparty risk. However, this guarantee does not include the financial responsibility of the clearing participant for its clients; investors choosing a broker to trade must exercise caution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;market-making&#34;&gt;Market Making
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market participants or individual stock futures contracts may register as market makers on the exchange and simultaneously provide both buy and sell prices within the specified maximum spread. Exchange participants and their clients should be aware that individual stock futures contracts may not have a market maker registered to provide bid-ask spreads, and their trades will be based on market unit pricing. &lt;strong&gt;Investors should note that stock futures without registered market makers may involve liquidity risk, and caution should be exercised before entering the market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;risks-of-trading-stock-futures&#34;&gt;Risks of Trading Stock Futures
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock futures involve high risks. Losses arising from trading stock futures may exceed the initial margin paid, potentially requiring you to pay additional margins within a short period. If unable to meet these payments, your position may be liquidated, and you will bear all resulting losses. Therefore, it is crucial to fully understand the risks associated with trading stock futures and assess whether it‚Äôs suitable for you. Before engaging in transactions, consult with a broker or financial advisor to determine if futures and options contracts are appropriate based on your financial situation and investment objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adjusting-comments&#34;&gt;Adjusting Comments
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a listed company alters its capital structure through measures such as a cash offer or the issuance of bonus shares, this will lead to changes in share prices at the time of net asset valuation or the effective date, and may also affect uncovered positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If other circumstances remain unchanged, the value of holdings held by shareholders will not be adjusted on the settlement day; however, this is different for buyers or holders of stock futures. Unless the futures contract is appropriately adjusted, changes to the share price will unfairly and unjustly impact the value of a stock futures position. The adjustment ratio determined by the Settlement Corporation is based on maintaining the fair value of the futures contract and only made when there are significant changes. The Hong Kong Exchange will announce the details of the adjustments, and participants in the exchange must inform customers about the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Capital Monopoly and the Demise of the Online Education Industry</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:59:08 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent two trading days have seen a significant downturn in the stock market, exposing newcomers to the risks of the market. China is about to enter an aging demographic phase, and birth rates are dismal, with the decline exceeding the estimates of relevant experts, hindering industries that obstruct declining birth rates; the Party will take decisive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-student-burden&#34;&gt;Reducing Student Burden
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of us born in the 1990s didn‚Äôt have as many interest classes or tutoring sessions; after school, we would run wild playing. This was first due to the limitations of our families&amp;rsquo; conditions and second because tutoring centers hadn‚Äôt yet established a brand effect, convincing parents to trust them. Twenty years have passed in a flash, and since 2019, the capitalization of K12 education has seen the rise of online tutoring companies likeÁåøËæÖÂØº (Yuancu Tu), bolstered by capital, which have created various high-end tutoring centers by concentrating excellent resources. Despite exorbitant fees, parental enthusiasm remains unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of urbanization, many parents see education as a path to escape the constraints of the peasantry and achieve a social class leap. As cogs in the machine themselves, they don‚Äôt have much time to care for their children, not only because they are highly competitive but also because they don&amp;rsquo;t want their children to fall behind their peers. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult for nobles to become commoners,‚Äù and with ordinary education levels, it is hard for families in China to maintain their current social standing or make another class leap. If they enter vocational high schools, in today‚Äôs society, they believe this represents a downward slide in social status, which is something most parents cannot accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-student-burden-1&#34;&gt;Reducing Student Burden
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs revisit the reasons behind extracurricular tutoring and why parents seek it out. Textbook knowledge and example problems are straightforward ‚Äì many students can understand them easily. However, many subjects cover broad concepts superficially without delving deeply. The talent selection mechanism requires differentiation, leading to a contradiction: exam questions based solely on textbook knowledge cannot effectively filter candidates. This necessitates horizontal and vertical expansion of learning. These areas are aspects that teachers simply cannot cover in the classroom, creating the fertile ground for extracurricular tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document contains numerous clauses and specifications, outlining multiple aspects and providing a summary of the guiding document‚Äôs outline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely reduce the total amount and duration of homework assignments to alleviate students&amp;rsquo; excessive workload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the level of after-school services offered by schools to meet diverse student needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strictly govern extracurricular training activities and comprehensively standardize their behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significantly enhance teaching and learning quality to ensure that students master what they learn at school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen supporting governance and improve support capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully organize and implement it, aiming for tangible results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;elite-education&#34;&gt;Elite Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs also a phenomenon in the education sector ‚Äì the increasing prevalence of powerful private schools. Public schools are struggling to provide sufficient high-quality resources (leading to enclaves/gated communities). Various sized educational groups are attracting excellent teachers with high salaries, establishing quality learning environments, and gradually building their own brands, most notably: &lt;strong&gt;Hen Shuai Model&lt;/strong&gt;. Old Home Corporation averages over 3000 RMB, powerful private primary schools charge between 9000 and 10000 RMB per year. Educational groups form a virtuous cycle ‚Äì my tuition is expensive, but the teachers are excellent, students achieve good grades, I raise tuition fees, and parents will still send their children here. Public resources (teachers) are gradually being drawn to private schools, ultimately becoming synonymous with substandard education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;algorithmic-optimization&#34;&gt;Algorithmic Optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is data showing that Meituan‚Äôs contracted delivery riders have approached 4 million, with approximately 400,000 active riders. Many people rely on this job to support their families and livelihoods. The relentless algorithmic pressure to minimize delivery times reduces individuals into measurable units, feeding them into algorithms for constant calculation, continually exploring the boundaries of delivery rider collapse. Believing themselves clever, &lt;strong&gt;they violate human nature and serve capital.&lt;/strong&gt; The market operates here, allowing everyone to play and enjoy sustainable play, rather than &lt;strong&gt;monopolizing, wielding privileges, the gameplay of capitalism, a reckless and brutal growth that will ultimately come to an end&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility&#34;&gt;Stock Market Volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 2021, education stocks represented by New Oriental performed a dramatic plunge, followed by Hao Pai Futures in the pre-market session. &lt;strong&gt;Stock prices plummeted by half.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has gradually entered an aging population, and various social phenomena affecting family planning must be rectified; monopolistic and overtime internet companies were fined, and the capital-concentrated education industry was also scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility-1&#34;&gt;Stock Market Volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The education industry is not allowed to be capitalized on; a single vote directly negated related industries&amp;rsquo; IPO financing, and there was wailing everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A pattern of disruption to test system stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The domestic internet industry is always fond of playing with new things, often introducing terms that most people wouldn‚Äôt be able to guess what they are.
After reading some articles, this definition specifically for the early stages of Chaos Engineering is relatively easy to accept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early exploration of Chaos Engineering has actually been ongoing within the industry, previously existing under the guise of fault testing and disaster recovery exercises. As microservice architectures continue to develop and distributed systems grow ever larger, Chaos Engineering has begun to emerge and gain increasing importance. Following Netflix‚Äôs formal proposal of the Chaos Engineering concept, related theories have also rapidly enriched. Netflix&amp;rsquo;s practices have also demonstrated the significant impact Chaos Engineering has on stability.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kubernetes paused pod</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/kubernetes-pause-pod/</link>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/kubernetes-pause-pod/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Deployment controllers implement a crucial function within a Kubernetes cluster: the ability to horizontally scale and shrink Pods. This capability was essential for traditional cloud-era platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encountering a business scenario where you need to modify data in a database, restarting Pod nodes after adjustments. However, during Pod operation, table fields are continuously modified, requiring temporary pausing of application updates to tables, adjusting the data, and then restoring the Pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides abruptly deleting the Deployment, are there other ways to achieve a similar pause effect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;kubectl scale --replicas=0 deployment/&amp;lt;your-deployment&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before seeing the answer, many people might have thought that simply operating processes was the way to go, stuck in the mindset of directly manipulating business processes instead of realizing the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fixed Income Funds / Bond Funds</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/funds-and-fixed-income-wealth-management/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 11:27:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/funds-and-fixed-income-wealth-management/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Those of us born in the 90s, we didn‚Äôt really feel the impact of the 2008 financial crisis ‚Äì after all, we were young and hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet started to focus on finance. The roaring bull market of 2015 came with a lot of fanfare, and when it ended, it made quite a stir, ultimately requiring government intervention to stabilize the markets. Simultaneously, this brought the concept of ‚Äúfunds‚Äù into the view of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ant-financial-and-alipay&#34;&gt;Ant Financial and Alipay
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a natural traffic entry for Ant Financial, Alipay was born with the positioning of a payment tool. When purchasing funds, Alipay and WeChat both saw widespread adoption ‚Äì most people chose Alipay. Alipay has successfully transformed fund sales into an ordinary shopping experience. Starting in 2019, during the small bull market, fund managers‚Äô ‚Äúwarming up‚Äù recruitment, ultimately driven by the monetary easing guided by the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who entered made a profit, those who didn&amp;rsquo;t enter envied them and rushed to join. The scale of new funds broke through the hundred billion mark at an increasingly rapid pace, and with grandmothers starting to buy funds, another trillion fund is not far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Alipay‚Äôs explosive rise as a code-driven internet fund sales platform, ordinary people&amp;rsquo;s contact with fund sales was primarily when depositing money in banks, where the branch manager would enthusiastically introduce various investment products. The internet packaging and promotional page information guidance, the exorbitant advertising fees given by fund sales institutions, completely detached Alipay‚Äôs fund advertisements from rationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal bank fixed-term investment returns are 4%, P2P investments that played wildly in recent years were 8%, credit card repayment interest rates are 12%. Our protagonist, Alipay&amp;rsquo;s promoted funds ‚Äì 150% and 250% ‚Äì were popular in the market, making everyone happy, both inside and outside the market? Alipay was playing with fire.&lt;/strong&gt; The advertised returns only showed the three-year cumulative yield chart, while traditional fund companies only presented annualized average yields. Why didn‚Äôt they dare to present the annual average yield alone? Because it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t look good, and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t guide customers to purchase funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fixed-income-investment&#34;&gt;Fixed Income Investment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;China hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet entered a negative interest rate era, making bank deposits and government bonds the most secure fixed-income products. Pure credit funds are also a good option. You can refer to the data published by local statistical bureaus to find China‚Äôs average wage levels. I‚Äôll present a simple scenario: with an asset size of 2 million (CNY), an annualized yield of 4%, the annual income will exceed most cities&amp;rsquo; average wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is largely based on my personal experiences, and there‚Äôs much more I could write. If you want to learn more, I recommend reading a variety of economic books yourself ‚Äì don&amp;rsquo;t blindly follow. For ordinary families, the core of financial planning is preservation, not chasing risky dreams of getting rich quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle often says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right thing at the right time has the greatest value; study diligently when you‚Äôre studying, and getting a good degree is better than earning pocket money by distributing flyers; work seriously when you first graduate, and the growth in your salary will bring you substantial returns; and when you start a family, learn to take care of your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue-1&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those interested can take a look at this speech transcript: On Time, you need to read many books to find the answer. The text transcript is available on our site.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/docker-two-three-things/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having worked with CentOS for many years, content may not apply to macOS or Ubuntu users in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can refer to the documentation from Tsinghua University for installation guidance: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/docker-ce/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to unknown mysterious forces, domestic Docker installation is recommended to set the cloud vendor&amp;rsquo;s repository address. Here we recommend using &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;set-repository-source-address&#34;&gt;Set Repository Source Address
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;yum install yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo http://mirrors.aliyun.com/docker-ce/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deploy-the-latest-version&#34;&gt;Deploy the Latest Version
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Docker is a commonly used background service, we recommend setting it to start on boot. The following command applies to CentOS 7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo yum install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io &amp;amp;&amp;amp; systemctl enable --now docker
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deploying-a-specific-version&#34;&gt;Deploying a Specific Version
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The releases of &lt;code&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; are not fully synchronized. If you need to deploy &lt;code&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; subsequently, refer to the &lt;code&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; deployment instructions and install a specific version of &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;yum list docker-ce --showduplicates | sort -r
sudo yum install -y docker-ce-18.09.2-3.el7 docker-ce-cli-18.09.2-3.el7 containerd.io-18.09.2-3.el7 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; systemctl enable --now docker
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adding-docker-permissions-for-regular-users&#34;&gt;Adding Docker Permissions for Regular Users
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;uninstall&#34;&gt;Uninstall
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo yum erase -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;everyday-use&#34;&gt;Everyday Use
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;mirror-acceleration&#34;&gt;Mirror Acceleration
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs still an unknown mysterious force that causes slow image pulls. At this time, domestic cloud vendors have emerged and provided many acceleration services, which are still recommended ‚Äì &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acceleration addresses can be managed by you registering an Alibaba Cloud account; this service is free. Alibaba Cloud also offers a free image build service.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linux Setup JMeter Test Environment</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-setup-jmeter-testing-environment/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 10:12:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-setup-jmeter-testing-environment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The author has a strong interest in hardware and used JMeter to conduct load testing, documenting the process of deploying JMeter, InfluxDB, and Grafana on CentOS 7. They shared installation and command usage for JMeter, InfluxDB‚Äôs features and Docker installation method, as well as a simple deployment and configuration for Grafana. They summarized experience and references related to high-performance programming patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As widely known, I have a very strong interest in hardware. By chance, the test team was using &lt;code&gt;JMeter&lt;/code&gt; to perform load tests and discovered that performance wasn&amp;rsquo;t improving. As a curious individual, I decisively took action to see how the company conducted its testing. There‚Äôs also a small story: at some point in the distant past, I read a post on OpenChina about how to create more impressive-looking performance test graphs ‚Äì after observing &lt;code&gt;Windows&lt;/code&gt; versions execute tests and achieving visualized &lt;code&gt;TPS&lt;/code&gt; data display, what&amp;rsquo;s the use of configuring a web panel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking is all well and good, but you have to try it yourself to understand.
Don‚Äôt use GUI mode for load testing! only for Test creation and Test debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-1&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officially, it‚Äôs recommended to obtain test reports via the command line and display them using a GUI, which introduces data errors.  I don&amp;rsquo;t have deep knowledge of JMeter ‚Äì at least I found a reason to tinker with a &lt;code&gt;Linux&lt;/code&gt; version console panel. The openchinese post‚Äôs core component deployment isn‚Äôt friendly; you need to follow their WeChat channel to download the required files, so as a young millennial, of course I used &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt; instead. Basically, my server is located domestically, and accessing the overseas source addresses is very slow ‚Äì at least using an image service, Alibaba Cloud has a free acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; installation and deployment, this will not be elaborated on here; please refer to previous articles for recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following content focuses on two main areas: setting up the basic test environment components and a simple explanation of each component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jmeter&#34;&gt;JMeter
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apache JMeter is a Java-based load testing tool developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It‚Äôs used to perform stress tests on software, initially designed for web application testing but later expanded to other testing domains. It can be used to test static and dynamic resources, such as static files, Java microservices, CGI scripts, Java objects, databases, FTP servers, etc. JMeter can simulate massive loads from various stress categories to test the strength of servers, networks, or objects and analyze overall performance. Furthermore, JMeter can perform functional/regression testing on applications by creating scripts with assertions to verify that your program returns the expected results. To maximize flexibility, JMeter allows using regular expressions to create assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache jmeter can be used to perform performance tests on static and dynamic resources (files, Servlets, Perl scripts, Java objects, databases and queries, FTP servers, etc.). It can be used to simulate heavy loads on servers, networks, or objects to test their strength or analyze overall performance under different stress types. You can use it for performance graphing or large concurrent load testing of your server/script/object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-deployment-on-centos7&#34;&gt;Jmeter Deployment on CentOS7
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;code&gt;JDK&lt;/code&gt; runtime environment, download the &lt;code&gt;Jmeter&lt;/code&gt; installation package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
wget https://mirrors.bfsu.edu.cn/apache//jmeter/binaries/apache-jmeter-5.4.tgz &amp;amp;&amp;amp; tar -xf apache-jmeter-5.4.tgz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configure environment variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;export JMETER_HOME=$HOME/jmeter/apache-jmeter-5.4
export PATH=$JMETER_HOME/bin:$PATH
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-commands&#34;&gt;JMeter Commands
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it will be connected to the &lt;code&gt;Grafana&lt;/code&gt; dashboard, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to input the &lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt; parameter to observe data in the &lt;code&gt;web&lt;/code&gt; console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;jmeter -n -t /tmp/order-500-10s.jmx -l /tmp/jmeter-order-report-20200109/order-500-10s.jtl
# Generally, don&#39;t use test results and test reports to simplify the command
jmeter -n -t /tmp/order-500-10s.jmx
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;influxdb&#34;&gt;InfluxDB
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfluxDB is an open-source distributed time series database written in Go. It requires no external dependencies. The database is now primarily used for storing large volumes of timestamped data such as DevOps monitoring data, app metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influxdb-features&#34;&gt;InfluxDB Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfluxDB‚Äôs features can be summarized into the following 9 aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schema-less (Schemaless):&lt;/strong&gt; Can contain an arbitrary number of columns;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metric Retention Time Setting:&lt;/strong&gt;  Allows setting the retention time for metrics;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Time-Related Functions:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports functions related to time (such as min, max, sum, count, mean, median, etc.) for convenient statistical analysis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage Policy Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Can be used for data deletion and modification (InfluxDB does not provide methods for deleting or modifying data);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Query Support:&lt;/strong&gt;  Automatically scheduled sets of statements that run within the database, combined with storage policies to reduce InfluxDB‚Äôs system footprint;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native HTTP Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Built-in HTTP API;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Similar SQL Syntax:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports a syntax similar to SQL;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Setting Data Replica Count in Clusters:&lt;/strong&gt; Allows setting the number of replicas for data within clusters;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Periodic Sampling of Data:&lt;/strong&gt;  Writes data to another measurement, facilitating granular data storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influxdb-docker-installation&#34;&gt;InfluxDB Docker Installation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;mkdir influxdb &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd influxdb &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
docker run -p 8086:8086 -d --name influxdb -v $PWD:/var/lib/influxdb influxdb:1.7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker exec -it influxdb /bin/bash&lt;/code&gt; enters the container, executes commands, and manually creates a database&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;root@bce0a55bbc72:/# influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.7.10
InfluxDB shell version: 1.7.10
&amp;gt; Execute commands in the interactive shell
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influxdb-database-and-user-creation&#34;&gt;InfluxDB Database and User Creation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create database: &lt;code&gt;create database jmeter_t2&lt;/code&gt;
View databases: &lt;code&gt;show databases&lt;/code&gt;
Switch to database: &lt;code&gt;use jmeter_t2&lt;/code&gt;
Create user: &lt;code&gt;create user &amp;quot;admin&amp;quot; with password &#39;admin&#39; with all privileges&lt;/code&gt;
View users: &lt;code&gt;show users&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; show users
user  admin
----  -----
admin true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the user permissions for &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; are displayed as &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, the database setup is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grafana&#34;&gt;Grafana
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing test cases, it was found that the chart visualization effect is not very necessary; the &lt;code&gt;tps&lt;/code&gt; data from the interface can be observed when executed in the command line, and more importantly, we wanted to know the internal timing of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple deployment of the &lt;code&gt;grafana&lt;/code&gt; console panel, importing a configuration file to connect with &lt;code&gt;InfluxDB&lt;/code&gt;, was performed. The console supports filtering test results through tags; generally, only one &lt;code&gt;InfluxDB&lt;/code&gt; database needs to be configured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application Name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Case Name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;docker run -d --name=grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana:7.3.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the sampling interval in the web version, the calculated &lt;code&gt;TPS&lt;/code&gt; and related values do not match the aggregated report from &lt;code&gt;JMeter&lt;/code&gt;.  Refer to this link for reference: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.vinsguru.com/jmeter-real-time-results-influxdb-grafana/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.vinsguru.com/jmeter-real-time-results-influxdb-grafana/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation also describes how to customize the &lt;code&gt;listener&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-performance program patterns invariably are one-loop thread; any locks, enqueueing, and dequeueing will cause unnecessary performance loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time spent on core business logic is greater than the time spent introducing other code, concurrency can effectively improve efficiency; if the core latency is sufficient, be cautious about introducing other code.&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Production environment operating systems, with Red Hat and CentOS being the mainstream choices. The documentation includes links to two system lifecycles and shares experience upgrading from CentOS 8 to CentOS Stream 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current domestic environment, Red Hat and CentOS are the mainstream choices for production environments. After experiencing the retirement of Red Hat 6 two years ago, this record includes the official website links for the lifecycles of both systems.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wiki.centos.org/zh/About/Product&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CentOS Product Specifications&lt;/a&gt;
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS are the mainstream choices for enterprise servers. RHEL provides stable support and update cycles, suitable for enterprise applications. CentOS as RHEL&amp;rsquo;s community edition, offers similar functionality and stability but without official support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;follow-up&#34;&gt;Follow-up
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When publishing this article, I didn‚Äôt expect to update it two years later. Just a few days ago, I upgraded my daily virtual machine from CentOS 8 to CentOS 8 Stream. I can&amp;rsquo;t say much about what to choose in production ‚Äì I prefer to keep the latest version in my local environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentOS 8 Stream is a rolling release version that offers faster updates and new features than traditional CentOS, making it suitable for development and testing environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs start with some tangential points, the differences between Chinese-style socialism and capitalism. From the mouths of the older generation, we heard that to get rich, you first needed to build roads. China&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure construction ‚Äì these things are all funded by the state, and in a capitalist society, they would be contracted out. In remote areas, there‚Äôs no profit motive, so companies wouldn‚Äôt willingly take on those projects. Talking too much is getting off-topic, and ordinary people might feel that trade wars don&amp;rsquo;t have much impact on their lives. However, China‚Äôs high-end manufacturing has always been relatively weak. The IT industry I work in ‚Äì memory, hard drives, CPUs, graphics cards ‚Äì the core configuration of assembling a computer comes from factories abroad. These components account for 50% of the total cost, and high-end manufacturing is undoubtedly essential. The collision between China and the United States is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Made in China 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;2018-2020 China‚ÄìUnited States trade war (often referred to as the ‚ÄúChina‚ÄìUnited States trade war,‚Äù ‚ÄúUS‚ÄìChina trade dispute,‚Äù ‚ÄúUS‚ÄìChina trade friction,‚Äù or ‚ÄúUS-China trade war‚Äù) was a trade war between the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade dispute originated when U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on March 22, 2018, claiming that &amp;ldquo;China is stealing US intellectual property and trade secrets,&amp;rdquo; and under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, imposing tariffs on goods imported from China totaling an estimated $600 billion. On July 6, 2018, the U.S. imposed additional tariffs of 25% on $340 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the United States. The Ministry of Commerce of China retaliated in kind with a 25% additional tariff on $340 billion worth of U.S. goods exported to China, including soybeans, the largest export product from the United States to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides had temporarily reached an agreement to pause the trade war in May 2018 and issued a joint statement seeking reconciliation. However, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative subsequently released its first list of tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the United States on June 16, raising the existing 10% tariff to 25%. The China‚Äôs State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) then retaliated with equivalent measures, and the Ministry of Commerce of China also restarted anti-dumping investigations into various U.S. products exported to China. On July 6, the Trump administration formally implemented tariffs on the first list of $340 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the United States, marking the formal implementation of Trump‚Äôs trade policy towards China (the remaining $160 billion was subsequently added with a 25% tariff on August 23). The Ministry of Commerce of China stated afterward that &amp;ldquo;The United States violated WTO rules and launched the largest trade war in economic history.&amp;rdquo; The General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) indicated that China‚Äôs counter-measures were implemented immediately after the U.S. imposed tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 1, at the G20 Buenos Aires Summit, leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump agreed to hold a nine-month negotiation and suspend new trade measures during the negotiation period. After the deadline of March 1, 2019, the U.S. side announced significant progress and extended the suspension of new trade measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs of 25% on approximately $200 billion, totaling $250 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the United States, which took effect on June 1. On May 13, the China‚Äôs State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) announced that tariffs on $600 billion worth of imported U.S. products would be raised to a range of 5% to 25%, starting from June 1. On June 1, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced that the implementation date for tariffs of 25% on U.S. goods would be postponed to June 15, and SAFE stated that China‚Äôs tariff measures took effect as scheduled on June 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 29, leaders Xi Jinping and Trump held a meeting at the G20 Osaka Summit, agreeing to restart economic consultations, with the United States ceasing to impose new tariffs on Chinese products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 1, due to concerns about China‚Äôs purchasing process of U.S. agricultural products, Trump announced on Twitter that tariffs of 10% would be imposed on the remaining $300 billion worth of all Chinese goods shipped to the United States starting September 1, 2019. On August 5, the Renminbi exchange rate against the US dollar fell below 7 yuan. The same day, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that China was designated as a currency manipulator. Subsequently, the Chinese government announced a suspension of purchases of U.S. agricultural products and announced tariffs of 10% or 5% on approximately $750 billion worth of U.S. goods, and resumed tariffs on U.S. automobiles and parts, while the U.S. side responded by increasing the tariff rates on its existing $300 billion Chinese goods to 15%, and its current $250 billion Chinese goods to 25% as retaliation, but these measures were subsequently shelved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building PCs</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/computer-assembly/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 14:33:46 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/computer-assembly/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The author has long had an interest in building computers from a young age, and began to delve into hardware assembly after university. They recommended websites for comparing hardware performance and offered purchasing suggestions, including CPU, solid-state drives, hard disk drives, and memory frequencies. They also shared their experience and advice regarding hardware selection and important considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wonder--unspeakable&#34;&gt;Wonder ‚Äì Unspeakable
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was young, I‚Äôve dreamed of building my own computer, but unfortunately, economic conditions didn&amp;rsquo;t allow it. Finally, after a lot of hard work, I reached university and built a laptop for portability. If I had to pinpoint a specific time when the idea started, it would be when I first began thinking about assembling computers at my hometown‚Äôs library. After all, it was a sizable city-level library, with not only an electronic reading room (though I never actually used it ‚Äì it was billed by the hour) but also a magazine reading room, where I discovered magazines like &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Computer News&lt;/em&gt;. For someone who had limited exposure to computers, these were practically divineÁßëÊôÆËµÑÊñô (scientific popularization materials). When I read about players ‚Äúdoing dungeons‚Äù and ‚Äúkilling monsters,‚Äù I thought about building my own computer to do the same, acting as the main output. And when I saw ‚Äúblack technology,‚Äù I fantasized about replicating what was described in the books, hoping to achieve similar effects (regarding the use of hacking tools).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I had a heavy workload in high school, with my limited understanding at the time, reading and playing were both important. It could be said that we lived a &amp;ldquo;naive and carefree&amp;rdquo; life, using the excuse of going to the library to read as an alibi, and I would often carry a small bag and walk there. The city wasn&amp;rsquo;t that big, so it was generally a walk. Arriving at the library, I enjoyed the air conditioning, reading novels, comics, and game magazines, occasionally even delving into more serious books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs easy for older people to forget things, and this is where the library sparked the initial seed. When I was in junior high school, relatives had assembled a computer, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it was used for back then. The operating system was Windows 2003, and there were built-in games like &lt;em&gt;Paper Cards&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;Empire&lt;/em&gt;. We all thought about ‚Äúoutsmarting‚Äù each other to steal keys, playing games together with my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I entered junior high school, the school offered basic computer training, and later I transitioned to a computer competition concept. I even qualified for NOIP (National Olympiad in Informatics) once. Speaking of this, it‚Äôs worth mentioning the power of our alumni. The high school&amp;rsquo;s computer building was donated by alumni, including a computer teaching room + library. At that time, it was also the initial wave of China‚Äôs internet boom. School leaders supported participation in computer competitions, as several senior classmates had been admitted to key universities through computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never reflected on my relationship with computers like this way. It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder that after graduating, I stubbornly switched from automation to computer science ‚Äì the seed had already been planted, and those within the circle didn‚Äôt realize it. Having encountered more things from a young age, I thought I was very skilled, but in reality, I only understood the surface level. My biggest advantage was the initial passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hardware-assembly&#34;&gt;Hardware Assembly
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browse through stores like Carda, Chiphell, and Zhihu‚Äôs computer assembly forums ‚Äì newcomers can relatively easily put together a list of the components they need. After 2019, when purchasing CPUs with limited financial resources, prioritize AMD for higher performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend a commonly used hardware performance comparison website: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/&lt;/a&gt;.  You can compare prices with US-imported parts on Xianyu (a Chinese online marketplace). True experts can find great deals by buying secondhand on Xianyu ‚Äì it‚Äôs significantly cheaper. If you&amp;rsquo;re not very familiar, I don‚Äôt recommend buying from Xianyu; I purchased fake memory myself, and while it hasn‚Äôt caused any problems so far, I‚Äôm not entirely sure about its reliability ‚Äì the model and specifications don‚Äôt match at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sn550-vs-sn750&#34;&gt;SN550 VS SN750
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between the SN550 1TB and the SN750 1TB is that they consistently read and write slower by a factor of two ‚Äì one reads at 850MB, while the other reads at 1.6GB. However, for everyday use, there‚Äôs no noticeable difference because both support 4K equally. Of course, this refers to the 1TB SN550; speeds are significantly slower in sequential read/write operations with the 500G and 250G versions. In my opinion, if you&amp;rsquo;re not a spendthrift, buying the SN550 is sufficient ‚Äì my main reason for not purchasing it wasn‚Äôt its sequential read/write speed, but rather that it only comes in a 1TB capacity, while the SN750 offers 2TB. For me, given the circumstances and without needing to expand further, my motherboard&amp;rsquo;s M.2 NVMe interface is more valuable than these SSD differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a consensus of online user feedback, purchasing an adapter board ‚Äì a B150 motherboard can also support M.2 interfaces for SSDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hard-disk-drive-selection&#34;&gt;Hard Disk Drive Selection
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the prices of hard disk drives are relatively stable. For users with large storage needs, it is necessary to select a suitable mechanical hard drive. Users who frequently download resources are recommended to choose enterprise-grade hard drives. Common ones include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Western Blue Disc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seagate Exos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large capacity mechanical hard drives are recommended to be partitioned, and frequent download operations should be fixed on a specific partition. If bad sectors appear later, they can be concentrated in one partition, and the current partition can be discarded, which can effectively extend the lifespan of the mechanical hard drive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a daily usage perspective, frequency will not have a significant impact on performance.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory timings (also known as RAM timings) are four parameters that describe the performance of Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM): CL, TRCD, TRP, andTRAS, measured in clock cycles. They are typically written as four digits separated by hyphens, for example 7-8-8-24. The fourth parameter (RAS) is often omitted, and sometimes a fifth parameter: Command rate (command rate), usually 2T or 1T, also written as 2N, 1N is added. These parameters specify the latency (delay time) that affects the speed of random access memory. Lower numbers generally indicate faster performance. The final element determining system performance is the actual latency, typically measured in nanoseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When converting memory timings to actual latency, it‚Äôs important to note that they are measured in clock cycles. Without knowing the clock cycle time, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to determine whether a set of numbers is faster or slower than another set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, DDR3-2000 memory with a clock frequency of 1000 MHz has a clock cycle of 1 ns. Based on this 1 ns clock, CL=7 gives an absolute latency of 7 ns. A faster DDR3-2666 (clock 1333 MHz, each cycle 0.75 ns) might use a larger CL=9, but the generated absolute latency of 6.75 ns is shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern DIMMs include a Serial Presence Detect (SPD) ROM chip that contains recommended memory timings for automatic configuration. The BIOS on the PC may allow users to adjust timings to improve performance (with the risk of instability), or in some cases increase stability (such as using suggested timings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Memory bandwidth is a measure of throughput for memory and is typically limited by transfer rates rather than latency. By interleaving access to multiple internal banks of SDRAM, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to transmit at peak rates continuously. Increasing latency may be used to increase bandwidth. Specifically, each new generation of DDR memory has higher transmission rates, but absolute latency has not changed significantly, especially in the first-generation products on the market, which often have longer delays than the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with increased memory latency, increasing memory bandwidth can improve the performance of computer systems with multiple processors or multiple execution threads. Higher bandwidth will also boost the performance of integrated graphics cards that do not have dedicated video memory.

        <title>Website Acceleration and Domain Settings</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/website-acceleration-and-domain-setup/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 10:36:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/website-acceleration-and-domain-setup/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to slow access to GitHub Pages from within the country, the author applied for a personal domain and purchased CDN acceleration services from a domestic cloud host provider. During the configuration process, the author encountered an issue where the www subdomain could not be accessed, which was ultimately resolved by deleting the generic domain DNS record and setting up a second-level domain separately. The author also shared the principles and configuration experience of CDN acceleration, as well as their attempts and lessons learned using reverse proxy with Nginx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, and due to some well-known reasons, accessing GitHub Pages internally can be slow. Therefore, I applied for a personal domain name and purchased CDN acceleration services from a domestic cloud host provider. When configuring the acceleration service, I thought about my development machine, which has Docker, frp, k8s, and other services deployed on it ‚Äì all with their respective dashboards. Following the principle of not wasting anything, I configured several reverse proxies, all using subdomains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was happily using these subdomains, I discovered that the www subdomain could no longer be accessed. In the Alibaba Cloud console, I had configured DNS to resolve both &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.xiangtianlong.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;www.xiangtianlong.com&lt;/a&gt; and xiangtianlong.com, and hadn‚Äôt yet enabled CDN acceleration; at that time, both domains were working normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When configuring CDN acceleration, due to a large number of subdomains, I enabled generic domain rules, which unified routed all traffic to the development machine. As a result, the www subdomain also went down ‚Äì yes, you read that right, the ‚Äúwww‚Äù prefix was a subdomain. In reality, the website is deployed on GitHub Pages, and the development machine has no caching information for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for why the website wasn‚Äôt deployed on the development machine, it&amp;rsquo;s because it‚Äôs a static blog, paired with GitHub‚Äôs action to automatically integrate publishing ‚Äì truly delicious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;domain&#34;&gt;Domain
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-professional web development, the understanding of domains does not involve SEO or cross-origin issues. As a blog site, a bare domain easily highlights the blogger&amp;rsquo;s site, such as myself who uses Chinese pinyin as my domain name, and given that mobile access is now more prevalent, it‚Äôs preferable to input fewer characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyboard shortcuts can be used on desktop to avoid entering ‚Äúwww‚Äù and ‚Äúcom‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cdn&#34;&gt;CDN
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used both Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud, and it‚Äôs easy for newcomers to get started. Tencent Cloud also has dedicated video explanations of the related concepts. The principle of CDN acceleration is similar to that of a JD.com warehouse: new products are pre-distributed to warehouses across China, and when delivery requests are triggered, they&amp;rsquo;re distributed locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Origin Address: The address where the original website resources are stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache file settings: Using F12 in your browser‚Äôs developer console to analyze static and dynamic resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All 0 days validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.php;.jsp;.asp;.aspx&lt;/code&gt; 0 days validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.jpg;.png;.js;.css;.woff2&lt;/code&gt; 1 day validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tencent Cloud configuration rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can configure up to 10 cache expiration rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The priority of multiple cache expiration rules is bottom-first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache expiration time can be set up to a maximum of 365 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;miserable-confession&#34;&gt;Miserable Confession
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had never used Nginx before, assuming that just searching for a website would reveal the configuration for reverse proxy. The result was quite confusing, and I spent half a day without even getting a 302 redirect to work. So, I decided to take a brute-force approach ‚Äì deleting wildcard domain resolution patterns in DNS parsing and setting up individual second-level domains. Suddenly, I noticed that Alibaba Cloud DNS had a feature called &amp;ldquo;Display URL Redirect,&amp;rdquo; which worked perfectly as a 302 redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up the first second-level domain normally, and then when I tried to set up the second one, it didn&amp;rsquo;t work. I was starting to doubt my sanity. After waiting for a while, it suddenly started working ‚Äì apparently, Alibaba Cloud DNS sometimes has hiccups with its DNS propagation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog IDE Environment and Ramblings</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-ide-environment-and-ramblings/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 13:54:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-ide-environment-and-ramblings/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This article introduces the basic concepts of Markdown and its applications in various software, recommends using VSCode as an IDE, and lists recommended plugins. The author shares their experience switching from Hexo to Hugo, emphasizing Hugo‚Äôs flexibility and customization capabilities. Finally, it provides some suggestions for quickly getting started with new technologies and shares a trick for resolving the issue of Hugo theme styles not updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lightweight markup language that allows people to write documents in an easy-to-read and -write plain text format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;markdown-1&#34;&gt;Markdown
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed Markdown syntax will not be elaborated upon in this document. We recommend an ebook, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://markdown-zh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;. Many software applications on the market now support MD as a writing format. The csdn blog system has launched an online editor that supports MD syntax; the default article when first using it is an introduction to MD syntax, which I think is quite good. Evernote added support for MD notes in 2018, with various MD markers available in the shortcut bar, making it almost as easy to use as editing a regular article, and the overall interaction process is friendly to beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ide-recommendations&#34;&gt;IDE Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing this article, it‚Äôs already 2020 ‚Äì you‚Äôve undoubtedly heard of VS Code, after all, anyone thinking about using Git Page to build a blog system is an industry professional. In the early years, Sublime and Atom were also good choices. Thanks to two years of promotion by the open-source community, VS Code has developed rapidly and has gradually become the preferred choice for newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Microsoft‚Äôs giant corporation and the open-source community has successfully transitioned from a state of division into a honeymoon phase: embracing open source. My company has also actively introduced the Java ecosystem in recent two years, meaning that in business development, Java&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem is currently very fragrant domestically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vs-code-plugin-recommendations&#34;&gt;VS Code Plugin Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/blog-ide-environment-and-ramblings/2020-03-31-14-07-17.png&#34;
	width=&#34;310&#34;
	height=&#34;306&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Plugin List&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;101&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;243px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All plugins have their own Readme files, introducing basic usage, core functions, and some authors even provide demo screenshots.
&lt;code&gt;Paste Image&lt;/code&gt;, combined with Hugo&amp;rsquo;s image plugin method, is very convenient for importing images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt remember the shortcuts, open the VS Code shortcut management menu, search for ‚Äúmd‚Äù, read it several times; review it again to see the plugin usage instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I switched from Hexo to Hugo, as I love tinkering ‚Äì it‚Äôs just my nature! Ultimately, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the urge to quietly write articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo supports placing images and Markdown documents in a single folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Academic theme supports various article styles in its design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various convenient customization extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;academic&#34;&gt;academic
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The default website is &lt;code&gt;exampleSite&lt;/code&gt;, and menu introduction uses the &lt;code&gt;#component&lt;/code&gt; approach. It‚Äôs recommended to use &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The URL pattern allows for single-page navigation when clicking on navigation links, rather than scrolling to the homepage. This is purely a matter of personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style: Notebooks, Speeches, eBooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility: Customization of overall style and custom CSS styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme‚Äôs Chinese support isn&amp;rsquo;t fully complete; primarily from a visual perspective, the font sizes don‚Äôt align well with Chinese reading habits. However, Hexo‚Äôs development team is largely comprised of Chinese developers, which is an advantage over Hugo in this regard.  Nevertheless, ‚Äúyou get what you build‚Äù ‚Äì manually customize your browser elements. When locating an element to determine the CSS style name to modify, clicking &lt;strong&gt;Insert Style Rule Below&lt;/strong&gt; allows you to easily obtain the node name even with nested CSS layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/customization/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Introduce &lt;code&gt;custom.css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/customization/#add-scripts-js&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Introduce &lt;code&gt;custom_js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The theme‚Äôs built-in syntax highlighting settings can be found here: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/#highlighting-options.&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Official Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kids are complaining again, saying you talk in such a vague and unclear way, without mentioning any details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to say is that with these things, you have enough to work with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Official Manuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugin Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When quickly getting started with new technologies, it‚Äôs recommended to first read the official website documentation, &lt;strong&gt;scanning through&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì not aiming for a single thorough reading.  The results you get from search engines may not always be consistent with the latest version and could potentially mislead you. Reviewing a new book in the same way is also advisable: first look at the table of contents to understand what the author intends to cover, and sometimes it‚Äôs beneficial to read the introduction ‚Äì particularly with translated foreign books, the preface often covers the core content of the book and its scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-eggs&#34;&gt;Easter Eggs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching the Hugo Academic built-in style settings and publishing to the site, the style didn&amp;rsquo;t change when accessed. A clever teammate already figured it out ‚Äì clearing local browser cache solved the problem.  I, being equally ingenious, used: F12 developer mode, switched to &lt;code&gt;network&lt;/code&gt;, checked &lt;code&gt;disable cache&lt;/code&gt;, refreshed, and voila!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Automatic System Switchover</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your Hugo blog to GitHub Pages and Gitee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;background-introduction&#34;&gt;Background Introduction
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday while updating the blog, I discovered that the travis service was unavailable. Upon checking the travis webpage, I noticed the progress was stuck during source code retrieval, and a flash of insight occurred ‚Äì I thought about GitHub‚Äôs previously launched action service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to being busy at the time and also needing to apply for access to use action, it has now officially gone live. With some free weekend time, I decided to try out a new toy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official documentation can be found by entering the website yourself; this article won&amp;rsquo;t provide further reprints. If you‚Äôve used Kubernetes before, you‚Äôll find that the action YAML file configuration is very similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding introductory tutorials or Chinese introduction materials, I recommend searching for &lt;strong&gt;ÈòÆ‰∏ÄÂ≥∞‚Äôs blog&lt;/strong&gt;. There are two articles ‚Äì the first introduces the basic syntax, and the second provides a practical case study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;#### Content

Required Knowledge Points
- GitHub Secrets
- Action Syntax
Core jobs use existing components to complete, pushing to domestic Gitee uses command implementation, this command part is quite brutal, all are forced pushes, inherited from the logic used with Travis.

```yaml
name: github pages and gitee pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - hugo

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          submodules: true

      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: &#39;latest&#39;
          extended: true

      - name: Build Github and Gitee ## Single step can only write one run command
        run: hugo -b &amp;quot;https://www.xiangtianlong.com/&amp;quot; -d &amp;quot;github_public&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; hugo -b &amp;quot;https://www.xiangtianlong.com/&amp;quot; -d &amp;quot;gitee_public&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ls

      - name: Deploy Github
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.BLOG_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./github_public
          publish_branch: master
          cname: xiangtianlong.com

      - name: Deploy Gitee
        run: cd ./gitee_public &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git init &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git config user.name &amp;quot;TianlongXiang&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git config user.email &amp;quot;tianlongxiang51@gmail.com&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git add . &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git commit -m &amp;quot;Update TianlongXiang&#39;s Blog&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git push --force &amp;quot;https://xiangtianlong:${{ secrets.GITEE_PASSWORD }}@gitee.com/xiangtianlong/xiangtianlong.git&amp;quot; master:master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
#### Epilogue

Based on the actions provided by the official market, currently there are quite a few supported playstyles. After building a Docker image, it‚Äôs no longer dependent on services offered by Docker Hub. 

Reviewing the Hugo issues, using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy Git Pages results in the final published website needing to be on the master branch. If deployed from another branch, the settings interface will prompt an error indicating that the deployed webpage has syntax problems.

This is simply because Hugo‚Äôs source files are located on the master branch, and GitHub treats it as the Jelly blog&#39;s source code for detection, unable to check and resolve any errors resulting in the error message. 

The solution is straightforward: move Hugo source files to another branch and publish static files to the master branch.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hope that twenty years from now, I‚Äôll be a cute old man, spending time with a cute old woman. I don&amp;rsquo;t seek great wealth or status; just to be healthy and strong enough to travel and explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said that in 10 years, I‚Äôll be a charming old man, and I will work hard to become a charming old man. The future of China must be one with good old men and good old women. Even if I am 60 years old in 10 years, I will be the youngest person in this world&amp;rsquo;s third kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly speaking, if everyone sees the 50-year-old Chinese man with this physique, it‚Äôs quite impressive. But behind this physique is a phrase I believe in: the more disciplined you are, the freer you become! When it rains, I want to go for a run; tomorrow afternoon, I will play soccer. At 50 years old, I can still play big games, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a joke. Moreover, I often play with professionals. But what‚Äôs behind this? It‚Äôs discipline. I spend my remaining days running, and people might find running very monotonous. The more disciplined you are, the freer you become. Because of my discipline, I can run freely, without listening to music ‚Äì because I think my own breathing is the most beautiful music while running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I basically don&amp;rsquo;t run on a treadmill. And many people in Beijing experience severe smog; I run 5 days a week, and two days are left for the smog. Then, jokingly, I say it might be because I never stop. Every month, I draw one day of my running experience in my diary ‚Äì at least 18 days each month, and when I run, they just flash by. When I run, I also take off my glasses, but more importantly, I still play soccer every week. My graduate students‚Äô last lecture is always held at our home on that particular day, with a theme called ‚ÄúFun.‚Äù I think fun is very important. I never deal with people who lack any joy or hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would rather avoid such people ‚Äì they are too frightening; if you don&amp;rsquo;t have fun, you feel like you have nothing to enjoy. You like what kind of job? In early January this year, one of my graduate students wrote for &lt;em&gt;China Weekly&lt;/em&gt;, and we had a special issue called ‚ÄúLooking Ahead.‚Äù Ten years from now, my graduate students will, at the end of each graduation year, write an essay for me ‚Äì and I keep those essays. Then, ten years later, I‚Äôll continue to develop them, and I&amp;rsquo;ll also write one as a 50-year-old to a 60-year-old; 60 is a distant land that I never thought of before, but it‚Äôs just another stop on my way to 20 ‚Äì writing to my students who are 30. That‚Äôs like a love letter from spring to summer. But when I&amp;rsquo;m 50 and write to 60, it‚Äôs like autumn whispering to fall. Now, I‚Äôm writing to myself ten years from now, from the whole world, about my bed, a meal, and the company of my family ‚Äì this is normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what will I be at 60? My title is very clear: in this long article, I said that in 10 years, I‚Äôll be a charming old man, and China wants to be charming not just because there will be more young people like citizens who become citizens, no longer just ordinary people; energetic young people, young people who understand rules. The future of China must be one with good old men and good old women. Currently, over 60-year-olds in China exceed 2.3 billion ‚Äì and that number will definitely exceed three billion in 10 years, meaning that if you consider only the population over 60, China would be among the top five countries in the world, or even the third. Imagine how frightening that is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt find it frightening. I wonder if you&amp;rsquo;ve seen online a table of the average life expectancy in various provinces and municipalities of China ‚Äì Shanghai and Beijing both exceed 80 years, including men and women. Men naturally occupy a larger share of the female population. That means even if I am 60 years old in 10 years, I will be one of the youngest people in this world&amp;rsquo;s third kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future. If women retire at 55 with an average life expectancy of 80 years, and they continue for 25 years after retirement; if men retire at 60 with an average life expectancy of 80, and they continue for 20 years after retirement! You won‚Äôt do anything but dance square dances. And I can say that the older ladies and gentlemen who are dancing square dances today are cultural habits and entertainment styles brought to them by the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty - I was one of the youngest members of the team when I was 60 years old, and I should be what kind of person? Chinese painting says that at 60, your ears become attuned, and I believe I wouldn‚Äôt listen to anything then, always happy, still annoyed by things I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t mention, and even happiness would turn into unhappiness. More importantly, I need to figure out what to do for the young people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should we do for good things? Don‚Äôt be lazy, don‚Äôt easily compromise, speak up when you need to oppose, because young people might harm their interests, can you stand in front of them and block their way? I often look at myself in the mirror now. My good friend, Tao Wei, passed away ‚Äì he used to gather with us at our home, and once told me a true story. We collectively mourned together, and back then, the older generation like Chen Lao would hoard things at home, spilling everything out of the box, hiding 30-odd items under the bed. You need to tell him how much that piece of clothing cost ‚Äì over 500 yuan ‚Äì and then support it, lighting incense every day. Therefore, this generation of ours is used to fighting with our parents, arguing about knowledge and ideas. How much did we buy back for 700 yuan?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;220&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But it‚Äôs risky. Once, Tao Wei bought a T-shirt for his father for over 400 yuan. That shirt was really good ‚Äì how much did it cost? 99, I wore it. The next day, disaster struck. When he came back from work, he praised Tao Wei and gave him 400 yuan to buy four more shirts for me. After I wore it out, Zhang Shu Li Da Ye all thought it was great, and later said the risk of lying like this is very large. Don‚Äôt do such things in the future. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to mention a specific person ‚Äì in the hospital orthopedic department, an elderly man broke his bone, and the most important reason was that he bought shoes from a street vendor. Of course, I‚Äôm only talking about this on a material level. Even when you get old, you still need spiritual life and curiosity, and you should be willing to shield young people from the wind and rain, live one day happily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very curious and excitedly waiting for my 60th birthday to arrive. I think it‚Äôs the beginning of a beautiful time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thank you all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The very common phrase &lt;strong&gt;information fragmentation&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì since graduating from high school, aside from the time I spent reading novels, I haven‚Äôt really taken the time to sit down and read a book quietly and attentively for a long time. Sometimes, looking back, after so many years of work, I still remember what I did each year? Often, by the middle of the year, I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten a lot of things from the first half. Writing a blog is a good habit, even though much of what I write isn‚Äôt appropriate and doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äì it was originally written for myself to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most loyal readers are myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of my own 18 years was like a gaze of anticipation and questioning, and each person occasionally asks themselves, &amp;ldquo;Are you the way you wanted to live back then?&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that everyone now has countless circles, no friends, chatting all day long, no one to have a heart-to-heart conversation with, unlimited knowledge acquisition, yet far from wisdom. Everyone should use your 18 years to ask yourself, &amp;ldquo;Are you the way you wanted to live back then?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think each of my own 18 years was like a gaze of anticipation and questioning. You can deceive others, but you cannot deceive your 18-year-old self. Is today you the way you were supposed to be at 18? I feel it&amp;rsquo;s okay. Today, material fame and many other things have been obtained, which is much more than what I thought when I was 18, but on the other hand, we are always on the road. When I was in journalism school at the Broadcasting Academy, I wanted to become a top reporter like Faraway, and today I&amp;rsquo;m still on that path. But this is exactly what many people say about Mr. Bai ‚Äì &amp;ldquo;How have you stayed on CCTV because you want to be a good journalist?&amp;rdquo; News is still there. This is my 18-year-old gaze, so I think everyone occasionally asks themselves, ‚ÄúAre you the way you wanted to live back then?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is truly impossible to deceive others. This is my appearance at 18, but it‚Äôs gone in a blink of an eye. Twenty-eight years have passed. Every person who comes to Beijing to study will have such a photo album. In that era, the wrinkled suit on Tianmen Square, and the school badge pinned to the chest, because at that time there were few college students, no school badges, feeling very proud. Their hair was long back then, but they still liked their 18-year-old appearance. Many years later, I suddenly realized I was grateful for the things I faced at 18, because it silently shaped me. In 1986, on May 8th, I bought a selection of Misty Poems at Wangfujing Bookstore. That year, I listened to Cui Jian‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne and All‚Äù at the Workers&amp;rsquo; Stadium. Today, I suddenly realized that my writing style was most influenced by it, including my personality being influenced by Misty Poetry, Rock Music, and Lu Guhong‚Äôs martial arts novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did you experience at 18? You can carry that with you. I especially want to know what the 18-year-olds today are experiencing? Are they being carved up like a knife chopping wood? What tools are they using? What kind of appearance are they shaping? I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that everyone now has countless circles, no friends, chatting all day long, no one to have a heart-to-heart conversation with, unlimited knowledge acquisition, yet far from wisdom, knowing nothing and seemingly everyone is talking about individuality. But as an observer, I find that today‚Äôs young people are very similar. What should I do? What should I let the 18-year-old experience? I really like 1986 because 1986 was the best way to solve 1966.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1966 Cultural Revolution was ended by 76 in 1986, which had a degree of chance; it could only be ended by the enlightenment and awakening of human nature and the growth of every individual. This truly allows you to dig up the concerns you have. I think we still need enlightenment, we still need to fully understand human nature. No matter how much economic progress or changes China has made, if we don‚Äôt truly fill in the understanding of human nature, and then respond to the good side of human nature and control the bad side, there will still be many things that worry us in the future. So my 18 years were also this era&amp;rsquo;s 18 years, it&amp;rsquo;s gone too far, don‚Äôt forget why you started in the first place, now condensed into four big words: ‚ÄúÂàùÂøÉ‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think no matter how far you go, everyone should use your 18 years to ask yourself. So taking a photo at 18 is good, and often take it out to ask yourself. What others say doesn‚Äôt matter? It&amp;rsquo;s too difficult to deceive yourself. I just said to today‚Äôs 20-year-olds, ‚ÄúYou should always let your 18-year-old be the eyes that watch you.‚Äù  I also mentioned earlier that in my twenties, you should try many doors, because you don‚Äôt know which one is most suitable for you&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This excerpt recounts the author‚Äôs perspective on the profession of journalism, emphasizing that reporters should possess a social conscience, a broad knowledge base, and perseverance. The author also shares their reflections at age 50, including maintaining curiosity, achieving balance between material and spiritual pursuits, and contemplating the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best journalist is first, having a social conscience; second, possessing knowledge; and third, being able to run long distances. I couldn‚Äôt handle running 100 meters ‚Äì I ran it. I believe these three things combined, people expect the safety concerns surrounding vaccines to be completely resolved, just like with the melamine scandal. We always move forward in a logic loop of problems arising, solving problems, and completely resolving them. Otherwise, what is there for a journalist to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-1&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe the best journalist first has a social conscience, second has knowledge reserves, and third can run long distances ‚Äì I‚Äôve outrun the 100 meters, so it‚Äôs no problem. I think these three things combined, at 50 years old, you‚Äôll understand that I seem to be well-suited for journalism. I&amp;rsquo;m naturally intertwined with China‚Äôs 40 years of reform, and on my 30th birthday, standing by the banks of the Songhua River, when I was 40, my birthday coincided with the 2008 Olympics, and I came out of the Olympic broadcast in which I went in. At 50 this year, as China commemorates 40 years of reform and opening up, there‚Äôs certainly a corresponding connection ‚Äì whether the ‚ÄúGreat Era‚Äù is at forty or China‚Äôs reform is at fifty-five?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that after walking through 40 years of road, China has already given people enough in terms of material things, and to the country enough. However, anxiety and confusion have increased, not decreased. We thought we were strong and wealthy, so everything was OK, but we discovered that material wealth is just a foundation; it‚Äôs difficult to become spiritually rich and truly a great power. The United States is already attacking your high-tech, we need to attack agricultural products. There&amp;rsquo;s always been a saying in the world: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s hard for second place to be achieved!&amp;rdquo; How many Second Place countries has America fixed? Therefore, we must go through a long period of time to transform ‚Äúnot one‚Äù into surpassing ourselves. I can‚Äôt get everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate that I started doing television at 25, first from figure interviews, and I contacted hundreds or thousands of figures with various halos. At that time, young people thought that these halos must make them very happy, but when they got closer, they found no, the halos have little to do with their happiness, and sometimes they are inversely proportional. Recently, I just finished reading about Guo Moruo‚Äôs last 29 years ‚Äì Guo Moruo barely escaped persecution, serving as Deputy Minister of State Council, Vice Chairman of CPPCC, Vice Chairwoman of National People&amp;rsquo;s Congress, etc. But his two sons committed suicide, and the other may have been thrown to death from a building? Would he be happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you use to measure happiness? When you are in your sixties, two of your sons leave you in a few years; even if you‚Äôre a Deputy Minister, can you be happy? Many famous paintings can make people happy, and spending many years safely is enough to make you happy. What do you want? So I think looking at people is the best mirror. To say something more important, I think much of our anxiety now comes from thinking too much and reading too little books. This is Yang Geng‚Äôs reply to a young person ‚Äì if you don&amp;rsquo;t read books, you rely on fast food; you pick up a mobile phone and plan to find a miracle pill. How can that be? I learned cleverness through the slow process of more and more books; subtraction comes from reading more books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I don‚Äôt expect everyone to achieve it, but I hope the proportion increases ‚Äì more and more Chinese people can read themselves better in books, which is the most important thing. No one sits on the ground and looks up at the stars, trying to figure out everything. I can&amp;rsquo;t do that. But I can look in a mirror. A few years ago, when a BBC news anchor came to Beijing, claiming to be the ‚Äúmost awesome‚Äù news anchor in BBC, he had someone organize a dialogue between him and a Chinese news anchor; we talked. That guy asked me during the conversation, &amp;ldquo;What do you think BBC should learn from CCTV?&amp;rdquo; I first made a joke and said, of course, they should first learn Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, after making a joke, I said, ‚ÄúI think BBC most needs to learn from CCTV is their curiosity about this world.‚Äù We‚Äôve been observing the world with great curiosity these years as we quickly reach out to the world; we have more than 70 correspondents now, and we feel that when a student sees something new in foreign countries, he feels very curious. We carry a huge sense of curiosity and observe the world, while BBC has already considered Britain itself as the world. You don‚Äôt need to be curious anymore. The brother slapped the table and said, ‚ÄúWhat we lack is this thing.‚Äù In 2007, when I interviewed a Japanese writer, he told me, &amp;ldquo;Japan&amp;rsquo;s country besides lacking hope, has everything else.&amp;rdquo; Later I realized that this sentence was really deep; from another angle, ten years ago, I thought China Okay, here‚Äôs the English translation of the provided text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúTo be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m very worried that China will one day end up on the downside ‚Äì feeling truly impoverished even when everything is available. I fear that by the time I‚Äôm 50, I‚Äôll become a person who, despite having all material comforts, is incredibly poor. The problem in our reality is that there are many highly educated people with no culture, and many impoverished individuals with countless numbers on their bank accounts. That&amp;rsquo;s really what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with this era. True poverty isn&amp;rsquo;t frightening because there‚Äôs a forward direction and hope. This is why I say that a lack of morality and human failings are the root cause. Therefore, I believe scientists invented so much not because they initially carried great missions, but out of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to figure it out myself. So I&amp;rsquo;ve always encouraged myself to be curious, especially around 50 years old. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm happy now. One thing that bothers me is persistence ‚Äì as you were saying you‚Äôre still persisting. I said don‚Äôt say that persistence leads to death. In the past, we used to say ‚Äòpersistence equals success,‚Äô and ‚ÄòChina football will persevere even during the black minutes,‚Äô or ‚Äòpersevere,‚Äô but it loses its fun and method, so we rely on perseverance. Sometimes persistence is important, but often it has an opposite side. I‚Äôm afraid that when I do something, like chatting with people, I&amp;rsquo;ll persist in finishing what I started ‚Äì which is now too late for my time, but I‚Äôm curious to see how these conversations will turn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give myself a small keyword and engage in conversation with others. At 50 years old, as long as you can still maintain a great deal of curiosity, there&amp;rsquo;s no problem. I like all fun things, but not necessarily the most popular things today. Trendy terms change quickly ‚Äì do you remember some of them? Will a media outlet on the internet 10 years from now become a traditional media outlet? So fun things always have their own intrinsic appeal. I respect everyone‚Äôs preferences; there must be a reason behind it, but when viewed over the long term, we see that Chinese people most enjoy playing mahjong. If you also like eating fast food, then restaurants serving large meals will naturally decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things aren&amp;rsquo;t just about expressing an emotion and moving on. How much fragmented reading do you get from your daily mobile phone use? How much longer-form reading do you have? But this is also a process ‚Äì the mobile phone is becoming our handcuffs. So, seeing shorter content more often leads to short-sightedness. However, I don‚Äôt worry about ‚Äòcontent is king.‚Äô It will always return. You won&amp;rsquo;t keep entertaining yourself until your 40s, like I see teenagers drinking soda and telling them to drink less, but you know they will still drink it. On the other hand, I‚Äôm optimistic ‚Äì he‚Äôll eventually return to a tea-drinking lifestyle. This is the life of a Chinese person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s normal, but I hope the transformation will happen faster. We just express an emotion, and there are fewer investigative reporters now. You don&amp;rsquo;t read investigations. Thank you everyone.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What will Chinese football be like in 20 years?</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The supplementary reader responses were mostly hastily written in 2021. The time it took to transcribe Wang Yi‚Äôs speeches at the beginning of the pandemic was still when things were just starting ‚Äì don&amp;rsquo;t say twenty years later, or even a year or two later; the world is always beyond people‚Äôs expectations. Now that the epidemic has ended domestically in China, the overseas ones are still making a fuss. Regarding football, Chinese national team played quite well over the past few years; the coach dared to give them free rein and attack, which was much better than when they were just starting out and accompanying Grandpa to watch games was somewhat interesting. What kind of experience is it that a national team‚Äôs game makes even an old man unwilling to change channels?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you still curious about Chinese football? Curious, very curious, what could be the difference? So you find that Chinese football plays badly because everyone is afraid to lose the ball in their own area and pass it to others, leaving themselves out; there&amp;rsquo;s no such way of playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is just one of many small reasons. When talking about 20 years of football, 20 years from now China‚Äôs football seems so distant ‚Äì the first expansion became 48 teams, and China might go or not go; the best age for a national team is 26-30, so 20 years later, those children aged 6 to 10 will be considered optimistic, but 20 years later it‚Äôs definitely going to be fine. When I mention children aged 6-10 today, you immediately look serious. Therefore, cause and effect ‚Äì what are we planting today? What will grow if we plant soybeans today? We almost planted soybeans that would make the national team play in the league, and what would come out of it? Whoever initiates this action will be prepared to be dismissed; this goes against the rules, so I didn‚Äôt think about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you should really think about those children aged 6-10 today ‚Äì are they playing football? If you know what Chinese football will be like in 20 years‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúTo do things properly, first and foremost, you need to have a clear conscience. This allows you to sleep soundly, without minor ailments or major issues. It&amp;rsquo;s best to avoid making mistakes in the first place. If you do make a mistake, it should be about trying to rectify it, not concealing it or hoping to forget it yourself ‚Äì humans are also capable of excellent memory. Inner peace is the destination; being able to answer your own questions with integrity allows you to live more lightly.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have eight words to say that are quite heavy, and I feel we‚Äôre currently experiencing a moral deficit, a depletion of humanity, and the times are constantly presenting problems that require solutions ‚Äì a completely resolved logical cycle forward. You need patience to wait for its shuffling. For a country like China, many things are a slow shuffling process, so don&amp;rsquo;t be pessimistic about change; it&amp;rsquo;s being shuffled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These past few days, China has been battling two typhoons: one was intangible, and the other was tangible. The intangible typhoon is the vaccine, which is impacting our inner security dam. The other typhoon rarely landed in Shanghai, and then caused trouble for Beijing and Tianjin ‚Äì a rare occurrence over several decades. This is an aside; next, you need to consider whether you can improve yourself, whether you‚Äôve undergone significant changes, and whether you have many answers. If the surrounding environment remains unchanged, will you be happy? I have eight words to say that are quite heavy: I feel we currently have a moral deficit and a depletion of humanity ‚Äì this is the biggest deficit and the greatest loss at present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, people expect the vaccine‚Äôs safety risks to be completely resolved. This is like the case with melamine milk powder, so sometimes you need to look at history and understand that you know about the establishment and formation of the US Food and Drug Administration, which is closely related to the initial unsafe milk and dairy products. The Sanlu Milk Powder incident forced China to undergo significant changes in the dairy industry. While vaccines are not happening one after another, I hope this time it‚Äôs a halt. You need to know that times always present problems, solve them completely ‚Äì this is the logical cycle forward; otherwise, what do reporters do? What do citizens do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I believe that each of us can do is to be concerned. But the problem is that Chinese people are easily forgetful, like I just said, after bumping into someone‚Äôs car, we stop on the side of the road and run away; no one blocks us. Our neighbors and colleagues have a large proportion of these kinds of people. So we need to change slowly. And as ordinary citizens, what we can do is to pay attention and not forget. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it‚Äôs a lack of something; when you‚Äôre hungry and cold, you talk about ideals all the time ‚Äì that doesn‚Äôt have persuasive power. But when he‚Äôs full and warm, he turns himself into China‚Äôs number one country for diabetes and high blood pressure, etc., you realize that Chinese people start running and dieting, and you ask the ladies present here, who hasn&amp;rsquo;t experienced the hardship of not being able to lose weight because they didn&amp;rsquo;t eat a good meal? This is a small change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are talking about the spiritual level, which must be the same principle. When you‚Äôre full and warm, you start running and dieting, then your spiritual needs will gradually increase. For example, I used to smoke, but after I started running, I unconsciously found that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t smoked for 20 days. I haven‚Äôt smoked since. Of course, I wouldn‚Äôt deliberately say, ‚ÄúI completely quit smoking,‚Äù because it feels too ritualistic; it doesn‚Äôt rule out occasionally smoking two or three cigarettes during the year. When your lifestyle changes, many things will change with it. I think for Chinese people, you need patience to wait for its shuffling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more people feel unhappy and unwilling to indulge themselves. Although depression is increasing, on the other hand, isn‚Äôt there also an increasing number of people seeking positive ways to live? At this time, spiritual things will grow. Don&amp;rsquo;t be pessimistic; look at the same thing in different ways. I often see drivers cutting people off in traffic, and I feel frustrated. But then I realize that the queue on the other side is longer than before ‚Äì this is how it is. You are sitting here on a rainy evening, willing to chat about useless things, isn‚Äôt that fun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a transformation; therefore, many things need to be thought of in a different way. Of course, I think there will be more and more things to grow in the future, such as when you start a business, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t start a business? Everyone&amp;rsquo;s life is starting a business. Su Shi wasn‚Äôt starting a business? Li Bai wasn‚Äôt starting a business? - Data Mining&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the English translation of the text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThere will be countless failures throughout a lifetime, and ultimately, creating your own brand is what matters. Most failures don&amp;rsquo;t matter if you don‚Äôt create them, as long as you live a life full of flavor and believe it‚Äôs worth it. I feel that China particularly lacks a good value system: failure is another form of success. People only accept the successful outcome, but failing well is also a success ‚Äì they don‚Äôt accept this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I find it difficult; you see many reasons why Chinese football isn‚Äôt playing well, and one of them is that everyone is afraid to lose possession and pass it to someone else. There‚Äôs no such strategy. Of course, this is just a small part of the problem. As I get older, at 30 years old, writing about the preface and happiness doesn&amp;rsquo;t come quickly; now at 50, there‚Äôs some urgency because time is passing too fast, and you expect many things to become reality. But on the other hand, I understand that for a country like China, many things are a slow shuffling process. You see older generations ‚Äì some were once nothing more than traffic lights, but occasionally you&amp;rsquo;ll see children pulling their fathers along as they change. They‚Äôre changing and being shuffled; so I think you need to be patient.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Regarding time, you need to read many books to find the answers.</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In general, the country is getting better and stronger, richer ‚Äì and that‚Äôs without diminishing the importance of individual vanity. Looking back from the 1990s to now, within the families I‚Äôve encountered, people&amp;rsquo;s lives have undeniably improved significantly. Simultaneously, the number of wealthy individuals has increased. As market-oriented economic development inevitably leads to widening income inequality, issues like class solidification and blocked upward mobility are prevalent globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is often discussed ‚Äì such as rigid social strata and limited opportunities for advancement ‚Äì are common problems worldwide. However, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge the Communist Party&amp;rsquo;s contributions to people‚Äôs basic welfare and social security, something everyone should take note of. Life will continue to improve; if you don‚Äôt want to buy a house, you can rent one. There are still inequalities in educational resources for children, requiring choices between better job opportunities, improved work environments, or more time with family. Don&amp;rsquo;t impose your own ideas on others, including your children and family members. Sit down and talk it through ‚Äì life will inevitably get better.&lt;/p&gt;

I‚Äôm now exactly 50 years old this year, and in the past I never thought about it; I felt that this was an old man. Now I realize it&amp;rsquo;s truly an old man ‚Äì this is what I looked like at 30. When I was 30, I didn‚Äôt feel very young, good-looking, and when I was 50 years old, looking back, it‚Äôs not bad; the biggest life lesson at 30? Looking back. I think it&amp;rsquo;s subtraction ‚Äì the key word is subtraction.  Somehow, &amp;ldquo;painfully happy&amp;rdquo; is also a kind of subtraction, letting you experience and write down many things, then leave them there on a new blank sheet, or running; but for me, at 30, I really feel that whether it‚Äôs about myself or reminding others, subtraction is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently guiding college students from China Central Television (CCTV), and I often remind them to &amp;ldquo;go all out&amp;rdquo; to add before they turn 30 ‚Äì to try things, you don&amp;rsquo;t know what kind of possibilities you have, you don‚Äôt know what opportunities fate will give you. It‚Äôs not about knowing; but some people work hard in their twenties, adding everything, but forget to stop when it‚Äôs time for subtraction. I think 30 is a very important period in life ‚Äì after doing a series of additions and running around everywhere, you need to do a significant subtraction; otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s too late. Why do you need to subtract? Not everything suits you, not everything is suitable for you; you should do all things, but not necessarily &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How far can 8 lines of rope hold you if they‚Äôre tangled?

By the time I was 30, I had been promoted to a full professor ‚Äì in other words, academically speaking, it&amp;rsquo;s called a professor; as for journalism, it&amp;rsquo;s a senior journalist. I was promoted at 29, and this kind of thing is rare now, but I started to feel a huge confusion when I did the Sydney Olympics in 2000.  I suddenly felt that everything wasn‚Äôt right. I had to ask myself, ‚ÄúWhat exactly do you want to do? Which things should be discarded?‚Äù That year, I made an important subtraction ‚Äì I stopped my show for a year, without appearing anywhere, and at that time people told me, &amp;ldquo;As a host, if you don&amp;rsquo;t appear on screen for a month, it‚Äôs okay; if you don‚Äôt appear for six months, no one will remember you.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúMy face is really cheap.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, I started to develop new programs. This was after finishing ‚ÄúPainfully Happy‚Äù in 2001 ‚Äì I stopped for a whole year. Everything I see today is a reflection on that time of subtraction. At that time, I could do many things ‚Äì I could do sports, I could do E (likely referring to the internet), I could do many other fun things, and be a producer; but I said no, I realized I could only do news, and I should do news most of all.  Then I was the producer for three programs, and I quit them overnight, and that‚Äôs what I am today. I became simpler. Just recently, I was chatting with a colleague, and I said, ‚ÄúWhen I was in my 30s, I made a very important decision ‚Äì not just because there were many things I could do, but I felt like I was just doing news; this deep well is something that might promote you to deputy director; I refused it, and returned to a normal level.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
Now, I‚Äôm a central television station&amp;rsquo;s senior editor ‚Äì not someone who graduated from university (undergraduate). You know our system, but I refused. I wanted to see how far a bachelor‚Äôs degree could go, and why a bachelor‚Äôs degree shouldn‚Äôt constantly learn and take students as assistants? Yes, now I have 11 students under my guidance, this is the result of subtraction.  Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s a reflection looking back. It‚Äôs also easy to feel in your youth that everything should be obtained ‚Äì if anything hasn‚Äôt been obtained, if something has a defect, you‚Äôll feel very uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don‚Äôt learn to subtract yourselves; when you‚Äôre about to turn 30, at 28, when I saw the Olympics in 1996, I came up with a sentence: ‚ÄúDefect is an important part of ‚ÄúThe moon is best when it‚Äôs not yet full. But for ordinary people, it will always be seen as a flaw, not perfect enough, not reaching the extreme. The worst way to ruin someone is to make them pursue perfection and reach the ultimate goal.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;flower-not-fully-open.jpg&#34; &gt;Flower Not Fully Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThis world isn‚Äôt like that; the most wonderful time is when the flower hasn&amp;rsquo;t fully bloomed. When it‚Äôs full, it‚Äôs close to falling; when the moon starts to become full, it‚Äôs close to becoming a waning crescent. Therefore, I think this was a very important boost and inspiration for me at 30. 40 wasn‚Äôt as beautiful then. But I felt relaxed. More free. Why not stop dressing in suits and ties, why not always be black and white? Let&amp;rsquo;s start asking about happiness?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese say that 40 is not confused, while 30 is about subtraction. 40 is about confusion, not wisdom. I think in today‚Äôs era, 40 is likely the most confused age. My midlife crisis started surprisingly early, around thirty-six or seventy, when I began to question whether everything I had done was valuable and meaningful. I wondered what happiness I truly desired. This book was born out of this confusion ‚Äì you&amp;rsquo;ll find that at 30, many of your happiness goals are tied to material possessions. ‚ÄúThirty and established‚Äù refers to having your education firmly in place. You need a car and a house; otherwise, your mother-in-law won‚Äôt consider marrying off your wife to you‚Äîit‚Äôs very materialistic. However, &amp;ldquo;40 is not confused&amp;rdquo; is difficult to achieve. I think ancient people had longer life expectancies than we do now, so they condensed 40 years into one, hence the lack of confusion. I&amp;rsquo;m currently 40 and feeling confused, &lt;strong&gt;and material things haven‚Äôt brought me happiness as I thought they would.&lt;/strong&gt; Similarly, when many people ask me at 40, ‚ÄúAre you happy?‚Äù My book title is &amp;ldquo;Happiness Waves,&amp;rdquo; which represents a question‚Äîit reflects my inner turmoil. The emergence of the midlife crisis: at 40, you need to answer yourself many questions, talk to yourself frequently, and read extensively to find answers. I‚Äôm fortunate that when I was thirty-six or seventy, I entered the world of the &lt;em&gt;Tao Te Ching&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;White Talk&lt;/em&gt;, I already discussed this; at 40, if your surroundings don&amp;rsquo;t change, especially the soft environment ‚Äì if you can stroll out of the house with a good mood and encounter countless red lights‚Äîbuying something is often fake, getting vaccinated is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said that recently China has been battling two typhoons, one visible and one tangible. The invisible typhoon is vaccines, which attacks our inner security dam. The other typhoon, Chinese typhoons rarely land in Shanghai ‚Äì this is a tangent; next, you need to think about whether you can focus on your own well-being. If your surroundings don‚Äôt change, will you be happy? &lt;strong&gt;I have an eight-character idiom that I find quite heavy: we are currently experiencing a deficit of morality and a loss of humanity‚Äîthis is the biggest deficit and loss at present.&lt;/strong&gt; Recently, I witnessed two cars colliding; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too serious. The responsible party was because he had stopped on the side of the road, and the other driver was preparing to stop. But the car in front sped away without stopping him. Is that a responsible father? Is that a responsible son? Never mind how he would be a responsible citizen‚Äîhe might even be your colleague. This is the deficit of morality and loss of humanity, which inevitably affects you. No matter how great a person you are, unless you haven‚Äôt left your home, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent your children from getting vaccinated, or sending takeout that may have problems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, how can Chinese people learn to transform from an ordinary citizen into a citizen‚Äîthis might be at my 40, both asking myself and posing an important question to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 30 is about subtraction, 40 is about confusion, I think 50 should be about curiosity. 50 is awkward; you‚Äôre neither in the village nor out of it ‚Äì you can attack if you go forward, retreat if you go back, and blend in if you stay put. If you lie down for ten years on something you&amp;rsquo;ve achieved, perhaps until retirement, that seems possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I read a book that said that truly successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are often older‚Äî50s or 60s. This is different from our concept. How can China stop treating entrepreneurship as a young career‚Äîjust like how China doesn‚Äôt treat youth volunteers as youth volunteers. Last week, I did a program to recruit retired primary and secondary school teachers; they receive a subsidy of two or three hundred thousand yuan per year and go teach in rural areas ‚Äì and must be excellent. This is truly opening the door for retirees to find new employment‚Äîof course, it‚Äôs not just charity, but getting back to 50 is still a distance away. How do you move forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifty-years-old&#34;&gt;Fifty Years Old

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, for a 50-year-old person, there are two challenges: the first is yourself ‚Äì are you still curious about many things? What is your outlook on life? I think my biggest gain at 50, or the way I‚Äôm living now, is to treat every today well. Twenty years old tends to live in tomorrow, and at 50, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to dwell on yesterday. But I try to restrain myself, neither living in tomorrow nor in yesterday; I treat every today well. A 50-year-old shouldn‚Äôt always say ‚Äúwe‚Äôll talk about it tomorrow‚Äù or ‚Äúit was better back then!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back now, I realize I was young once too, I had so many hair, so I should cherish every day of today, because when you look back two years later, it&amp;rsquo;s best to see yourself as you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Shen Shing said, &amp;ldquo;When my legs couldn‚Äôt walk anymore, I sat in a wheelchair and constantly reminisced about the time when I could run and play basketball. Every day was filled with pain in my memories.&amp;rdquo;
Years later, I developed bedsores on my wheelchair and felt miserable. At that time, I always remembered those peaceful moments of sitting quietly on the wheelchair.
After even more years, I got kidney failure and had to go dialysis. At that time, I would always remember the days when I only had bedsores on the wheelchair. If I hadn‚Äôt reached the point of treating every today well at 50, those next 50 years would have been wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifty-years-old-1&#34;&gt;Fifty Years Old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually feel that it‚Äôs not until you reach 50 to truly understand this principle; you should grasp it in your 30s or 40s, as all things are easily missed if you wait. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a meal during a trip ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt eat it, you can still have it thirty years later, and even then, it might not be the same taste. Therefore, I believe treating every day with kindness is my first feeling at 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point is curiosity. I‚Äôve realized that I can stop being curious about many things at any time, because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so much and experienced so much, but I encourage myself to remain curious. So when I do a lot of things now, I approach them with a sense of curiosity ‚Äì can you hold your phone up for a shot? Yes, you can. You can do live reporting, attend seemingly large and solemn conferences, and even make the connection easier. It‚Äôs more fun and makes a bigger impression. You can then use new media to disseminate it. I believe curiosity is the most important driving force for human progress. Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be the most important driving force for individual progress? A nation will wither if it loses its curiosity. On a broader level, 50 is an important test. What kind of vested interests do you become at forty or fifty years old in China? I‚Äôm very worried that many people around me had dreams when they were young and went to achieve them, but once they achieved their dreams and became vested interests, they turned into those who blocked others from achieving their dreams, right? They would suddenly treat young people and things in the way they used to dislike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, several years ago, I started recruiting one graduate student each year as a volunteer, and they‚Äôve stayed for two years; now five groups have graduated, with 55 pure graduate students. I believe it&amp;rsquo;s a happy thing to become a vested interest ‚Äì you have certain insights, you can also guide them. After every class, I invite them to dinner, which doesn‚Äôt cost much. But this is what a good vested interest should do: a vested interest can be two aspects‚Äîone is to pave the way again. I once said that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to say thank you too often to those who helped me, because I want to repay them tenfold with new young people. This is how I express my gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you‚Äôre constantly saying ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and then become a blocker‚Ä¶&lt;/strong&gt; The next thing is to pave the way for others. I hope that in China, whether it&amp;rsquo;s material, economic, ideological, or cultural, all vested interests ‚Äì when you become one, what should you do? Yesterday, someone was pushing a cart; today they‚Äôre blocking the train. This has happened throughout Chinese history. It won‚Äôt be like this; sometimes it will even be worse, so I call on all vested interests to return to how they felt when they were young ‚Äì to do things as they did then. Perhaps I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good enough, but I thought about it, did it, and said it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Standard Library Container Memory Allocators: allocator</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/standard-library-container-memory-allocator/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2019 13:26:19 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A custom allocator can improve performance, increase memory utilization efficiency, and address the issue of frequent, small memory allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;antecedent&#34;&gt;Antecedent
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the development of network data packets, requiring frequent allocation and release of small blocks of memory. Initially, I considered using a memory pool, reviewing several existing ones and discovering this:
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/cacay/MemoryPool&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/cacay/MemoryPool&lt;/a&gt;
When looking at the interface, I was quite puzzled by how the memory pool&amp;rsquo;s implementation was a bit strange. The &lt;code&gt;MemoryPool&lt;/code&gt; implementation logic involves allocating fixed-size memory blocks. Having reviewed Boost‚Äôs memory pool interface, it provides a template that is instantiated when used. Fortunately, this library already had an article describing it, mentioning the concept of an ‚Äòallocator‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;#### [wiki](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E5%99%A8_(C%2B%2B))

In C++ programming, an allocator is a key component of the C++ standard library. The C++ standard library defines various data structures commonly referred to as &amp;quot;containers&amp;quot; (such as linked lists, sets, etc.). A common feature of these containers is that their size can be changed at runtime; therefore, dynamic memory allocation becomes necessary to achieve this. The allocator is used to handle memory allocation and deallocation requests made by the containers. In other words, the allocator encapsulates the low-level details of memory management for Standard Template Library (STL) containers. By default, the C++ standard library uses its built-in generic allocator, but programmers can customize allocators to replace it as needed.

The allocator was originally invented by Alexander Stepanov as part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), with the intention of creating a mechanism that would &amp;quot;make the library more flexible and allow independent use of low-level data models,&amp;quot; and enable programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types within the library; however, when the STL was incorporated into the C++ standard, the C++ standards committee realized that complete abstraction of the data model would result in unacceptable performance penalties. To compromise, restrictions on the allocator were made more stringent, and compared to Stepanov&#39;s original vision, the degree to which the current standard describes allocators is greatly limited.

Although customization of the allocator is somewhat restricted, it is still needed in many cases, typically for encapsulating access to different types of memory spaces (such as shared memory and reclaimed memory), or for improving performance when using a memory pool for memory allocation. In addition, from the perspective of memory usage and execution time, in programs that frequently perform small amounts of memory allocation, introducing a dedicated allocator can also yield benefits.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

#### [Usage Requirements](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E5%99%A8_(C%2B%2B))

The primary reason for defining custom allocators is to improve performance. Utilizing a dedicated custom allocator can increase program performance, or improve memory usage efficiency, or both [4][8]. The default allocator uses the `new` operator to allocate storage [Reference 5], which is often implemented using the C language heap allocation function (malloc()) [9]. Because heap allocation functions are optimized for occasional large memory allocations, the default allocator generally works well when allocating memory for containers that require a single large memory allocation at once, such as vectors and doubly-ended queues [8]. However, for associative containers and linked lists that frequently allocate small amounts of memory, using the default allocator typically results in low efficiency [4][9]. In addition, the malloc()-based default allocator also has many problems, such as poor reference locality [4], and may cause memory fragmentation [4][9].

In short, this section (‚Ä¶)(like) is a ‚ÄúDream‚Äù speech for this standard regarding allocators. Before dreams come true, programmers concerned with portability will be limited to using stateless custom allocators.
‚Äî Scott Meyers, *Effective STL*

Given this, in this situation, people often use memory pool-based allocators to solve the problem of frequent small allocations [8]. Unlike the default ‚Äúon-demand‚Äù allocation method, when using a memory pool-based allocator, the program pre-allocates large blocks of memory (i.e., &amp;quot;memory pool&amp;quot;) and then the custom allocator simply returns a pointer to an available memory location in the pool to the requester. When objects are destructed, it does not actually deallocate memory; instead, it is deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends [Note 1][8].

In the topic of ‚Äúcustom allocators,‚Äù many C++ experts and authors have participated in discussions, such as Scott Meyers‚Äôs *Effective STL* and Andrej Alexandrescu‚Äôs *Modern C++ Design*, which mention it. Meyers realized that if an allocator instance is required to be equal for a specific type T, the portable allocator instance must not contain state. Although the C++ standard encourages library implementers to support stateful allocators [Reference 4], Meyers said that this paragraph is ‚Äú(seemingly) a wonderful view,‚Äù but it‚Äôs almost nonsense, and he considered the restrictions on allocators ‚Äútoo strict‚Äù [4]. For example, the list in STL allows the `splice` method, which means a node in one list object A can be directly moved into another list object B, which requires that the memory allocated by A&#39;s allocator be released by B&#39;s allocator, thus deducing that the allocator instances of A and B must be equal. Meyers‚Äôs conclusion is that allocators should be defined as types using static methods. For example, according to the C++ standard, the allocator must provide a `rebind` method other class template.

Furthermore, in *C++ Programming Language*, Bj√∏rn Strub√∏ suggests ‚Äú‚Äòrestricting the allocator to avoid different information for each object‚Äô is obviously not a problem‚Äù (roughly), and points out that most allocators do not need state, or even perform better without state. He proposed three use cases for custom allocators: memory pool-type allocators, shared memory-type allocators, and garbage collection-type allocators, and demonstrated an implementation of an allocator using an internal memory pool to quickly allocate/deallocate small amounts of memory [3]. However, he also mentioned that such optimization may already be implemented in the sample allocator he provided.

Another use for custom allocators is to debug memory-related errors [10]. To do this, you can write an allocator that allocates extra memory when allocating and stores debugging information. This type of allocator not only ensures that memory is allocated/deallocated by the same type of allocator, but also can protect the program to some extent from cache overflows [11].
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
