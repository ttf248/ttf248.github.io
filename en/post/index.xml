        <title>GitHub Pages Easter Egg: Deploying Multiple Pages</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/github-pages-easter-egg-deploy-multiple-sites/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My sleep schedule has been messed up lately; I was still working on deploying my Github Pages at 2 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finishing my extra shift, I went to eat, and just after eating, I felt sleepy. I returned around 8:30, feeling drowsy, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d doze off for a bit, but ended up falling asleep directly. I woke up at over 2 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-lived category: AI Study Group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposing hypocrisy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We said yesterday we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mess with the frontend, but today we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on the UI/UX experience instead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d like to invite our old friend, [https://github.com/ttf248/ai-coding-demo]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, it’s the original self-selected stock project. The entire project structure is being refactored, and all subsequent AI programming content will be placed under this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploying Multiple Pages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is hosted domestically at [https://cnb.cool/ttf248/ai-coding-demo]. Due to well-known restrictions, publishing pages within China is not supported, so we need to publish it on a foreign GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog is published on GitHub. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried it, but it’s for publishing multiple projects as pages. Also, the current project isn&amp;rsquo;t a traditional blog site; it just contains lots of documentation and several static HTML designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/github-pages-easter-egg-deploy-multiple-sites/20250528030230.png&#34;
	width=&#34;798&#34;
	height=&#34;530&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;pages&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;150&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;361px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, I discovered that deploying multiple projects as Pages doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect blog publishing; instead, it adds a new path under the blog&amp;rsquo;s domain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/ai-coding-demo/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://ttf248.life/ai-coding-demo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perfect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI Study Group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a new category yesterday, thinking of using AI to learn many computer science courses, such as algorithms and LeetCode practice questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each learning record will be published on my blog, forming a knowledge base. A new category has been created: AI Study Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each course, create a new project and document your learning notes in the project&amp;rsquo;s Readme.md file&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Old habits, dazzling flowers distract the eye</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/old-ailment-stunning-flowers/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 23:54:12 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/old-ailment-stunning-flowers/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having focused on backend development for many years, I recently started exploring AI programming and dabbling in frontend-related content. However, during this experimentation, I&amp;rsquo;ve gradually realized I’m falling back into an old habit – being distracted by shiny things. I constantly want to use AI to build a frontend interface, but these attempts offer little practical benefit for my current work and instead disperse my focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI application scenarios&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI tools can be particularly effective in small projects, especially when writing functions that are independent, have low system coupling, and feature simple business logic. These tasks typically involve clear input/output with limited context, making them well-suited for current AI-assisted programming capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the limitations of AI become apparent when dealing with complex system architectures or deep business logic. It may generate code that appears reasonable but is actually detached from the project&amp;rsquo;s actual needs, and even introduce potential issues difficult to debug. In these scenarios, AI is better suited as an assistive tool rather than a fully relied-upon code generator. We need to rigorously review and test the generated code to ensure it meets practical requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cost of Mistakes and Learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While attempting to generate frontend code using AI, I encountered numerous challenges. As frontend isn&amp;rsquo;t my area of expertise, troubleshooting issues proved time-consuming and draining. Even with prompt adjustments for AI rewrites, low-level errors were difficult to avoid. This repeated trial and error not only wasted time but also highlighted that my efforts are better focused on backend business logic rather than exploring unfamiliar territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the project completed this weekend, I&amp;rsquo;m even more convinced that focusing on backend development and user interaction logic—achieving functionality through the console—is currently the most efficient approach. Systematically learning frontend knowledge later, when I have more time and energy, might be a better strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontend Learning Plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front-end tech stack is complex and diverse, making a quick start unrealistic. I plan to focus on one framework initially, such as Vue.js or React.js, and deeply learn its core concepts and usage. Only after mastering the fundamentals should I attempt AI-assisted code generation for the front-end, effectively avoiding errors and wasted time due to unfamiliarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the focus should remain on backend development and steadily building core skills. Explore the combination of frontend and AI when the time is right; that may yield greater rewards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Claude4 released, attempting development: Hugo tag, hyperlink translation assistant</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/claude-4-release-and-experimentation-hugo-tags-hyperlink-translation-assistant/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 03:05:31 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/claude-4-release-and-experimentation-hugo-tags-hyperlink-translation-assistant/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This site is built with Hugo, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Chinese titles, which results in unfriendly URLs. To put it simply, when shared, they don&amp;rsquo;t look good because Chinese characters are encoded as things like %E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD. While slugs can fix this, manually setting them each time is too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, today I tried using Claude4 to develop a translation assistant that automatically converts Chinese titles into English slugs and adds hyperlinks within articles. This would eliminate the need for manual setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude 4 is excellent; its ability to understand context and handle complex tasks has been significantly improved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Address&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic project address: [https://cnb.cool/ttf248/hugo-content-suite]
Foreign project address: [https://github.com/ttf248/hugo-content-suite]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code Implementation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the translation: First, let me outline the approach: We need to scan all articles, extract tag information and article titles, then call a local large language model (like gemma-3-12b-it) for translation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical development, &lt;code&gt;Claude4&lt;/code&gt; demonstrates several significant improvements compared to previous generations of large language models. Due to extensive functional requirements, &lt;code&gt;Claude4&lt;/code&gt; automatically designs interactive menus and comprehensively considers various use cases. For example, in tag processing, &lt;code&gt;Claude4&lt;/code&gt; not only supports tag statistics and analysis but also includes classification statistics and can even detect &lt;strong&gt;untagged articles&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, it provides &lt;strong&gt;preview&lt;/strong&gt; and tag page generation functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s integrating with local large language models, adding translation caching, or conducting extensive code refactoring, &lt;code&gt;Claude4&lt;/code&gt; completed everything in one go with virtually no issues. Despite the project’s modest size and numerous small features, large language models often forget previous context during development. This time, however, &lt;code&gt;Claude4&lt;/code&gt; performed exceptionally well, &lt;strong&gt;showing almost no contextual forgetting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, intelligence has improved, and we&amp;rsquo;re preparing to switch to &lt;code&gt;Claude4&lt;/code&gt; for more development work as our primary coding model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation Cache&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach, aside from reducing large model calls, offers good efficiency when running a 12b model locally without causing delays. However, repeatedly calling the large model can still be slow. Secondly, to maintain article links, full updates sometimes produce inconsistent results due to long titles, leading to link changes – which is quite awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature Optimization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire project was given to Claude4 for analysis, resulting in these optimization suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;配置外置化 - 提高可维护性和灵活性
结构化日志 - 便于问题排查和监控
性能监控 - 了解系统运行状况
用户体验 - 进度条等视觉反馈
错误处理 - 更完善的异常处理机制
代码组织 - 更清晰的模块划分
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code review was completed and everything looks good. For example, the configuration file now automatically generates a default if one doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist when reading it, converting previous configurations to defaults – preventing user errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requirements: While translating the main text, dynamically calculate the current translation efficiency, estimate the remaining time, and output relevant information to the console. This includes tracking the number of characters obtained from the article, the number of characters translated per line, the elapsed time, a fitted calculation for the translation time per 100 characters, and an estimated remaining translation time for the entire article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is done, but I&amp;rsquo;m not very satisfied with the results, so I asked AI to provide new design suggestions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provides multiple efficiency calculation methods: real-time efficiency, average efficiency, sliding window efficiency
Improved display methods: progress bar, segmented statistics, dynamic refresh
Add more useful metrics: API call count, success rate, etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing the code, I discovered a new surprise – real-time statistics on translation efficiency are displayed without mindless scrolling&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The multifaceted impacts of the family planning policy: profound changes from social structure to economic and political spheres</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/planned-parenthood-multidimensional-impact-social-structure-economic-political-transformation/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 02:36:49 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/planned-parenthood-multidimensional-impact-social-structure-economic-political-transformation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s family planning policy, while limiting population growth, curbed the development of family-based enterprises, undermined traditional social structures, and suppressed the expansion of family businesses and political influence. Compared to South Korea’s chaebols and India’s family monopolies, its uniqueness is evident. Now that birth restrictions have been lifted, although challenges such as low birth rates are faced, new monopoly risks must also be guarded against, and a balance needs to be sought through multiple avenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-population-control-and-the-rise-and-fall-of-family-style-development&#34;&gt;I. Population Control and the Rise and Fall of Family-Style Development
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family planning policy, serving as a fundamental national policy in China for nearly forty years, has yielded significant direct results. Data shows that from 1978 to 2007, the natural population growth rate of China decreased from 12‰ to 5.2‰, resulting in over 400 million fewer births and reducing the proportion of the world’s population held by China from 22.2% to 20.1%. This sharp decline in population growth has profoundly reshaped the family structure of Chinese society. Taking family businesses as an example, after the implementation of the family planning policy, the number of children born to business owners decreased significantly: before the policy, 40.63% had three or more children, while after the policy, this figure plummeted to 18.46%, and the proportion of single-child births increased from 6.25% to 32.31%. This structural change directly led to a significant reduction in the range of internal successors available for family businesses, objectively inhibiting their ability to expand across generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the situations in South Korea and India, the differences are significant. Although South Korea has not implemented strict family planning policies, its birth rate has been persistently low (0.7 in 2023). However, chaebols maintain a firm grip on the national economy through means such as cross-shareholdings and inheritance tax avoidance. The combined revenue of the five major chaebols accounts for over 50% of South Korea&amp;rsquo;s GDP, with Samsung alone accounting for 20% of the national GDP. India presents another picture: 79% of economic output is contributed by family businesses, and six conglomerates control key areas such as telecommunications and steel. The profits of 20 top companies account for 80% of the total profits of all enterprises in the country. The core difference lies in that China&amp;rsquo;s family planning policy, by limiting family size, weakens the human resource foundation for the expansion of family businesses from the source. Due to different policy environments, both South Korea and India have allowed family influence to continuously penetrate the economic sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;monopoly-restraint-and-social-structure-transformation&#34;&gt;Monopoly Restraint and Social Structure Transformation
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the economic sector is particularly evident in its suppression of monopolies. Due to reduced daughters, Chinese family businesses have struggled to form chaebol-style groups like those in Korea. Take South Korea as an example: chaebols maintain control through &amp;ldquo;circular investment,&amp;rdquo; with the Samsung family holding only 2% of the group&amp;rsquo;s shares but controlling everything through a complex equity structure. In China, family businesses after the implementation of family planning policies generally face the dilemma of “succession by offspring,” forcing them to introduce professional managers or undergo diversified equity reforms. Research by The Paper shows that the proportion of female successors in family businesses has increased from 13.85% to 34.21% after family planning, and their education levels have also significantly improved, with the percentage of bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree or higher increasing from 43.75% to 98.46%. While this transformation hasn’t completely eliminated family control, it has significantly reduced the possibility of a single family monopolizing the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the level of social structure, the family planning policy accelerated the disintegration of the traditional family core model. Household size in China decreased from 4.41 people per household in 1982 to 2.62 people per household in 2020; smaller families have weakened the functions of the family in terms of economic, educational, and social support. In contrast, India&amp;rsquo;s household size remains around 4 people, with the caste system deeply linked to family power, resulting in low social mobility. The transformation of China’s family structure has created space for individualistic development; by 2023, China had 240 million single adults, and the consumption market is seeing a trend of rising &amp;ldquo;individual economies.&amp;rdquo; This shift further diluted the influence of family economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;three-decentralization-of-power-in-the-political-sphere&#34;&gt;Three, Decentralization of Power in the Political Sphere
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the political landscape is equally profound. Traditionally, familial forces have infiltrated grassroots politics through kinship and marriage ties. For example, in Xinyi County, Henan Province, 161 political families virtually controlled all government departments, with 20% of cadres at the deputy section level or above being “second-generation officials.” However, after the implementation of the family planning policy, the reduction in family size limited the expansion of familial networks. Research from Peking University shows that the number of children among officials decreased after the family planning policy, and the complexity of political family networks declined significantly. In addition, the policy promoted education普及 (popularization), increasing the average years of schooling from 5.2 in 1982 to 10.9 in 2023, which facilitated social mobility and weakened the monopoly of familial forces on political resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing South Korea and India, the deep entanglement of Korean chaebols with politics (such as financial transactions between Samsung executives and the government) and the hereditary family politics under India&amp;rsquo;s caste system highlight the uniqueness of Chinese policies. China’s family planning policy has objectively reduced the possibility of power inheritance. Although familial phenomena still exist in county-level politics, the overall trend is a decentralization of the power structure. During the 2025 National People&amp;rsquo;s Congress and Chinese People&amp;rsquo;s Political Consultative Conference, a CPPCC member proposed renaming the &amp;ldquo;Law on Population and Family Planning&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Law on Population and Reproduction,&amp;rdquo; advocating for fully relaxing birth restrictions – a move that may further influence the evolution of future political ecology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;challenges-and-opportunities-after-policy-adjustments&#34;&gt;Challenges and Opportunities After Policy Adjustments
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the two-child policy in 2016 and the three-child policy in 2021 marked a significant shift in China’s birth policies. However, the effect has been limited: the fertility rate in 2022 was only 1.18, far below the replacement level (2.1). The relaxation of birth restrictions presents a dual impact on family businesses: on one hand, some entrepreneurs may enhance their family succession capabilities through having more children, such as Zong Fuli, the daughter of Quinghao from Zhejiang Wahaha Group, who is a single child taking over the business; on the other hand, high childcare costs (the average cost of raising a child to 18 in first-tier cities reaches 1 million yuan) and declining willingness among working women to have children limit family expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Releasing restrictions on births could give rise to new monopolies in the economic sphere. The three-child policy is driving concentration within industries such as maternal and infant products, and childcare, with the early childhood care market expected to reach 162.13 billion yuan by 2025. Leading companies are integrating smaller firms through mergers and acquisitions, resulting in a CR5 (concentration ratio of the top 5) exceeding 55%. While this concentration may bring efficiency gains, it also warrants vigilance regarding new monopoly risks. The government needs to seek a balance between encouraging childbirth and preventing market concentration, for example, by strengthening regulation through antitrust laws, while providing childcare subsidies (such as the 3000 yuan monthly milk powder subsidy available to families with three children in Hangzhou) to reduce family burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Releasing restrictions on birth rates may have subtle impacts on family power in the political sphere. While it will be difficult to restore traditional family political networks in the short term, over the long run, families with multiple children could potentially form new influence at the grassroots level. Therefore, improving cadre selection mechanisms and strengthening supervision (such as establishing a system of recusal for relatives of cadres) remains key to preventing power inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;v-international-lessons-and-future-prospects&#34;&gt;V. International Lessons and Future Prospects
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiences of South Korea and India demonstrate that the rise and fall of family power is closely related to policy orientation. South Korea achieved economic takeoff by supporting conglomerates (chaebols), but at the cost of social equity being damaged; India, due to a lack of effective policies to curb family monopolies, has seen widening wealth inequality. China’s birth planning policy, while controlling population, objectively suppressed the expansion of family power, but also brought about issues such as accelerated aging and labor shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, China needs to seek a new balance between population policy and socioeconomic development. On one hand, it should increase birth rates through supportive policies (such as extending maternity leave and building inclusive childcare facilities); on the other hand, it must strengthen antitrust enforcement to prevent family businesses from forming new monopolies through financial operations. In the political sphere, further progress is needed in grassroots democracy construction, improving oversight mechanisms, and ensuring transparency in power operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the family planning policy, as a significant driver of social change in China, has an impact far beyond the population sphere. It reshaped family structures, economic models, and the political landscape, providing a path for China to avoid falling into a Korean-Indian style trap of familial monopolies. As policies adjust, how to balance efficiency with fairness, freedom with order within the new demographic context will be a long-term challenge facing China.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Too much AI, a bit of a side effect</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-overuse-side-effects/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the new &lt;code&gt;AI Inspiration Hub&lt;/code&gt; was established, a lot of trivial things have been tried to be recorded and published using AI. As a result, there&amp;rsquo;s less time for quiet reflection and contemplation. It would be good to slightly control the output of this column in the future and integrate it into a monthly publication format, releasing one article per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like a kind of aftereffect, or perhaps a side effect – efficiency is improved, but the depth and breadth of thinking have declined&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;efficiency-improvement-undeniable&#34;&gt;Efficiency improvement: undeniable
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Seven Seconds of Fish&amp;rdquo; column hasn&amp;rsquo;t been well-maintained previously. Due to laziness, I didn’t search for information or compile records on some trending events. Now that various AI tools are available, outlining is sufficient; the AI can automatically connect to the internet, search for related event records, and generate articles as needed. A simple formatting adjustment, and it&amp;rsquo;s ready for publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like a godsend for lazy people, it significantly improves efficiency, and you could even say it achieves results with half the effort&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throwing aside the need to write articles, when writing code, the efficiency boost is real. Many coding tasks used to require detailed reading of API interface documentation, but now you can skip them directly – and this skipping is quite necessary. Familiarity with APIs is a &lt;code&gt;physical labor&lt;/code&gt;, not a &lt;code&gt;mental labor&lt;/code&gt;; AI handling this part is just right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;garbage-content&#34;&gt;Garbage content
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the submissions are low in quality; they aren&amp;rsquo;t entirely without merit, but they lack a sense of life and warmth. It’s a style I used to dislike – dry and lifeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, AI-generated content does feel a bit like something produced on an assembly line – lacking soul&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet junk of the new era&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forgetfulness&#34;&gt;Forgetfulness
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of article is all AI-generated, and I don’t know the readers&amp;rsquo; situation, but over time, my own impressions will become blurred, or even forgotten&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar issues arise when writing code as well. Without checking the commit history, you have no idea what you were thinking at the time and why you wrote it that way. This is especially true for code generated after repeated communication with yourself and AI – the final version can be very different from the initial idea, even completely different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;search&#34;&gt;Search
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a significant decrease in how often I open Google and Baidu recently. Many questions are now searched for using AI, and the interaction and search results are much better than traditional search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s pay our respects to &lt;code&gt;bing ai&lt;/code&gt;, a tool from a major company that was among the first released with internet search capabilities, whether it’s still alive or not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are using Google less, and visiting &lt;code&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/code&gt; less frequently too. Many questions can now be directly asked to AI, so this website is gradually being phased out by the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog I’m still maintaining didn&amp;rsquo;t have much traffic to begin with, and now even less so; it’s more of a place for keeping records, writing for myself&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Trade war suddenly put on hold</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 19:07:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of tariffs in the 2025 trade war presented a cycle of &amp;ldquo;escalation — retaliation — consultation,&amp;rdquo; as the US-China competition shifted from tariff confrontation to rules-based competition. While short-term easing alleviated market pressure, long-term uncertainty remains, and it is necessary to monitor the continued impact on the global economy from WTO rulings, supply chain adjustments, and geopolitical changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can&amp;rsquo;t earn money beyond their own understanding. The stock market crash triggered by the trade war this year, even now that losses have been largely recovered, has buried countless small investors along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the timeline for tariffs in trade wars in 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a breakdown of the 2025 trade war tariff timeline, incorporating key events from China, the US, and other countries to illustrate the evolving dynamics of tariff policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-april-2025-comprehensive-tariff-escalation-and-retaliation&#34;&gt;I. April 2025: Comprehensive Tariff Escalation and Retaliation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US tariffs on China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 2, the Trump administration signed Executive Order 14257, announcing a 34% tariff on goods imported from China, covering products from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 8th, the United States further increased tariffs on Chinese goods from 34% to 84% and signed Executive Orders 14259 and 14266, imposing additional tariffs on more products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 10th: The White House revised an executive order, raising the total tariffs on China to 145%, and increasing tariffs on small packages (such as raising the tax rate on goods under $800 from 90% to 120%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s countermeasures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 4th, China announced tariffs of 34% on all goods originating from the United States, covering areas such as agricultural products, automobiles, and energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 10th, China will raise retaliatory tariffs from 34% to 84%, matching the escalation by the US side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 12th: China canceled 91% of the tariffs imposed on US goods (corresponding to the portion cancelled by the US side) and suspended the implementation of the remaining 24% tariffs for 90 days, retaining 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariff disputes among other countries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US-Canada trade war: The United States has imposed a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum products from Canada. Canada retaliated by imposing tariffs on US$298 billion worth of American goods and filed a complaint with the WTO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The EU is imposing tariffs of up to 25% on US goods, while Japan has expressed concerns about tariffs on US automobiles, calling the trade war &amp;ldquo;harmful to both sides.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-may-2025-geneva-talks-and-tariff-easing&#34;&gt;II. May 2025: Geneva Talks and Tariff Easing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China-U.S. High-Level Economic and Trade Talks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From May 10th to 11th, China and the United States held 16 hours of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, reaching the &amp;ldquo;China-US Geneva Trade Talks Joint Statement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 12th: Both sides announced suspension of some tariffs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United States has suspended 24% of tariffs on China (for 90 days), retained 10%, and canceled additional taxes scheduled for April 8th and 9th&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China will suspend 24% of retaliatory tariffs, retain 10%, and remove non-tariff measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both sides agreed to establish a consultation mechanism and regularly hold trade consultations in China, the United States, or a third country, focusing on tariff reduction and rule-making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Impact and Policy Adjustments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US domestic pressure: High tariffs are causing small and medium-sized enterprises to go out of business (such as Amazon sellers being forced to close due to soaring tariffs), and inflation expectations are heating up (core PCE is expected to rise to 3.3%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s rare earth countermeasures: China has tightened controls on rare earth exports, cracked down on smuggling, and impacted the US military industry and new energy supply chain, forcing them to seek waivers for tariffs on rare earths and other key minerals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-other-key-events-and-long-term-impacts&#34;&gt;III. Other Key Events and Long-Term Impacts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WTO and multilateral response&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canada and China have separately filed appeals with the WTO over US steel and aluminum tariffs and &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; alleging violations of the non-discrimination principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned that US tariffs could cause a 1% contraction in global trade volume in 2025 and exacerbate the difficulties faced by developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exemption List and Industry Impact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US exemption goods: A 37-page list covering strategic materials such as rare earths, graphite, and medical CT tubes exposes supply chain vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US tariffs on imported cars of 25% have led to a global forecast of a 2% decline in auto production, with a 9% reduction in North America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political and strategic game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration attempted to reshape the international trade order through &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; but was criticized as unilateral bullying, triggering a backlash from allies (such as the EU and Japan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China is responding to protectionism by expanding market access (such as the China International Import Expo, and zero-tariff commitments) and attracting cooperation from developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-of-timeline&#34;&gt;Summary of Timeline
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Event&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 2, 2025, the United States will impose a 34% tariff on China, covering goods from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 8th, the United States will raise tariffs on China to 84% and introduce new tax administrative orders&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 10, China retaliated with a tariff of 34%, later raised to 84%; the US revised its tariffs to 145%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 12, the United States exempted certain goods (such as technology products), and China canceled 91% of its retaliatory tariffs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;US, China and Japan talks in Geneva reached a joint statement agreeing to suspend 24% tariffs (for 90 days)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On May 12, both sides announced a suspension of tariffs and a negotiation mechanism, easing trade tensions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;five-trends-and-challenges&#34;&gt;Five: Trends and Challenges
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-term easing and long-term competition: The suspension of tariffs between China and the US sends a positive signal, but structural contradictions (such as high technology and energy) remain, and midterm elections may affect policy continuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global supply chain restructuring: Companies are accelerating adjustments to their supply chains, with Mexico and Southeast Asia benefiting from “nearshoring,” but rising costs may dampen the recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The predicament of multilateral mechanisms: The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is constrained, regional trade agreements (such as the UK-US agreement) have become alternative options, but this exacerbates fragmentation&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Jiangxi Province&#39;s Special Post and National Civil Servant Teacher Recruitment Data (2020-2025): Trends and Insights into Change</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/jiangxi-specialized-post-and-national-cadre-teacher-recruitment-data-trends-and-transformation-insights-2020-2025/</link>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/jiangxi-specialized-post-and-national-cadre-teacher-recruitment-data-trends-and-transformation-insights-2020-2025/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2020-2025 teacher recruitment in Jiangxi Province shows a significant reduction trend: the number of special post teachers recruited decreased sharply from 6,617 to 32 (a decrease of 99.5%), and national cadre teachers decreased from 11,324 to 2,146 (a decrease of 81.1%). The proportion of core subjects (language, mathematics, English) remains stable but the total number is shrinking; although the proportion of subjects such as music, arts, and physical education has increased, the absolute numbers are limited (e.g., only 2 people were recruited in 2025 for each). Policy changes have implemented &amp;ldquo;one position reduction, one position replacement&amp;rdquo; staffing restrictions, with teacher resources shifting towards vocational education and remote areas, leading to a significant reduction in traditional primary and secondary school positions. In 2025, the planned number for some subjects was zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of specialized teaching positions recruited annually in Jiangxi Province, statistics for the past five years, categorized by subject and compiled into a table&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;——————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to recruitment announcements and public data released by the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, the Department of Human Resources and Social Security, and other official bodies, here is a summary of the hiring situation for special-post teachers and national civil servant teachers from 2020-2025. It should be noted that &lt;strong&gt;the 2025 data represents planned recruitment numbers&lt;/strong&gt;, and subject details were not fully disclosed in some years; disciplines marked as &amp;ldquo;not subdivided&amp;rdquo; in the table represent total statistics or missing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-data-description&#34;&gt;III. Data Description
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data sources: Annual recruitment announcements and official statistics from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education and the Human Resources and Social Security Department (actual figures for 2020-2024, planned figures for 2025)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject Classification
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specialized teachers focusing on compulsory education subjects in rural areas will be limited to a small number of core subject positions in 2025&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The national curriculum covers all grade levels, with a more comprehensive range of subjects, including early childhood education and special education (not listed separately due to data not being subdivided)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trend analysis
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall recruitment sharply decreased: The number of specialized positions for teachers in 2025 is down 99.5% compared to 2020, and the number of national civil service teachers is down 81.1%, reflecting changes in population structure and adjustments to educational resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot and Cold Topics in Academic Fields
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, Mathematics, and English) remains stable, but recruitment volume is shrinking year by year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of subjects such as arts, physical education, and music has increased, but the absolute numbers are limited (e.g., only 2 students will be admitted for each of arts, physical education, and music in 2025)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some subjects (such as English) have stopped admitting new students due to a decrease in student numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policy Background:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tightening of staffing quotas: Implementing a “replace one with one” policy, strictly controlling new quota allocations, and achieving a 68.6% proportion of off-quota positions in 2024&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structural adjustments: Teacher resources will be directed towards vocational education and remote areas, with a significant reduction in hiring for traditional primary and secondary schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Merge Pull Request into forked repository</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/merge-pullrequest-to-fork-repository/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 18:44:03 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;github-readme-stats&lt;/code&gt; is a statistics generator for GitHub profiles, allowing users to display various statistics and charts on their GitHub profile. It offers multiple customization options that can be adjusted according to user needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I manage my warehouse by grouping them into projects. GitHub doesn&amp;rsquo;t support warehouse grouping, so I have to achieve this by splitting them into different organizations. The latest branch of &lt;code&gt;github-readme-stats&lt;/code&gt; cannot support statistics across different organizations’ warehouses, so I forked a branch and merged the corresponding code.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Adds the ability to include data from organization repositories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;merge-pull-request-into-the-forked-repository&#34;&gt;Merge Pull Request into the forked repository
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to merge a &lt;strong&gt;Pull Request (PR)&lt;/strong&gt; into your &lt;strong&gt;forked repository&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on what you want to do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge the PR from the &lt;strong&gt;upstream repository&lt;/strong&gt; into your fork, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge a PR from another person&amp;rsquo;s fork into your fork, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge a PR opened on your fork (e.g., someone submitted a PR from their fork to you)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a common scenario: &lt;strong&gt;You forked a repository, and you want to merge a specific pull request from the upstream into your fork.&lt;/strong&gt; Here’s the workflow 👇:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;method-1-command-line-method-most-universal&#34;&gt;Method 1: Command-line method (most universal)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-1-clone-your-own-fork&#34;&gt;Step 1: Clone your own fork
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git clone https://github.com/你的用户名/仓库名.git
cd 仓库名
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-2-add-upstream-original-repository-address&#34;&gt;Step 2: Add upstream (original repository address)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git remote add upstream https://github.com/原作者用户名/仓库名.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-3-fetch-the-upstreams-pr-branch&#34;&gt;Step 3: Fetch the upstream&amp;rsquo;s PR branch
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the PR number you want to merge, for example, PR #123&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pull the code for this PR like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git fetch upstream pull/123/head:pr-123
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-4-switch-and-merge-branches&#34;&gt;Step 4: Switch and Merge Branches
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git checkout main    # 或者你自己的目标分支
git merge pr-123
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything is normal, you can push to your forked GitHub repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git push origin main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;method-two-github-web-interface-simple-but-limited&#34;&gt;Method Two: GitHub Web Interface (Simple but Limited)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see a pull request on the GitHub website that is for an upstream repository, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to that PR page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;ldquo;Commits&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Files changed&amp;rdquo; in the upper right corner to see which branch this PR is based on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On your fork page, create a new branch and then manually cherry-pick the PR’s commits (this requires some Git knowledge)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or click &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Open in GitHub Desktop&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; to merge using a graphical user interface tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;if-someone-has-submitted-a-pull-request-for-your-fork&#34;&gt;If someone has submitted a pull request for your fork
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just go directly to the PR page and click the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Merge pull request&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; button&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like me to walk you through it step-by-step based on your current situation (e.g., a PR link, whether you&amp;rsquo;re using a web page or command line)? You can also give me specific links, and I’ll help you analyze the simplest approach&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Modifying commit messages in Git history</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-modify-commit-message/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 18:38:31 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-modify-commit-message/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The script is used to batch modify the author information of Git history commits by rewriting commit records using git filter-branch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script you provided is intended to batch modify the author information in Git repository history, and the overall idea is correct. However, using arrays (like &lt;code&gt;OLD_EMAILS=(&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;) in &lt;code&gt;--env-filter&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;git filter-branch&lt;/code&gt; may cause compatibility issues because some shell environments (such as &lt;code&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;) do not support array syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve compatibility, it is recommended that you replace the array with a space-separated string and iterate through each old email address using a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of the modified script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;#!/bin/sh

git filter-branch --env-filter &#39;
OLD_EMAILS=&amp;quot;TianlongXiang51@gmail.com nick@qq.com tianlongxiang51@gmail.com&amp;quot;
CORRECT_NAME=&amp;quot;tianlong.xiang&amp;quot;
CORRECT_EMAIL=&amp;quot;tianlong.xiang@foxmail.com&amp;quot;

for OLD_EMAIL in $OLD_EMAILS
do
    if [ &amp;quot;$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;$OLD_EMAIL&amp;quot; ]
    then
        export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_NAME&amp;quot;
        export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_EMAIL&amp;quot;
    fi
    if [ &amp;quot;$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;$OLD_EMAIL&amp;quot; ]
    then
        export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_NAME&amp;quot;
        export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_EMAIL&amp;quot;
    fi
done
&#39; --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precautions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to back up your repository before running this script to prevent unexpected situations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This operation will rewrite the Git history, modify the author information of commits, and may cause changes to commit hash values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have already pushed changes to the remote repository, you need to use a force push&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git push --force --tags origin &#39;refs/heads/*&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please use force push cautiously, especially in collaborative projects, to avoid impacting others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find all unique author email addresses in the warehouse statistics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git log --format=&#39;%an &amp;lt;%ae&amp;gt;&#39; | sort -u
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>The Celestial Realm of Medical Education and the Butterfly Effect of the Dong Xi Ying Incident</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-sky-dong-xiying-butterfly-effect/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 01:08:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-sky-dong-xiying-butterfly-effect/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Peking Union “4+4” program (4 years of non-medical undergraduate studies + 4 years of medical doctoral studies) emphasizes interdisciplinary elite training. The Dong Xiying incident in 2025 exposed its reliance on family background (a lineage of medical professionals/researchers) for entry into the program, raising questions about the clarity of her academic credentials and allegations of plagiarism in her thesis. This incident revealed a contradiction between the elitism of the recruitment model and fairness, while issues regarding shortened training periods and supervised practice remain unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt&#34;&gt;Prompt
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog post: The origins and development of Concordia 4+4, core points: a corner of the celestial palace glimpsed by mortals, Dong Mingmei&amp;rsquo;s family background, it’s impossible for a normal medical PhD to graduate in eight years, Dong Mingmei&amp;rsquo;s family background and educational background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-palace-of-medicine-at-peking-union-medical-college-disassembled-a-44-system&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Palace of Medicine&amp;rdquo; at Peking Union Medical College, Disassembled: A 4+4 System
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;4+4&amp;rdquo; program at Peking Union Medical College, launched in 2018, has been regarded as a “heavenly palace” for medical education in China. Designed to emulate the American medical education system, and guided by the principles of &amp;ldquo;embracing individuals with multidisciplinary backgrounds,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;embracing those who love medicine,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;embracing talent from all over the world,&amp;rdquo; this program seeks to create a break within the traditional medical education system. Its core logic lies in &lt;strong&gt;replacing the traditional 5+3+3 model (5 years for undergraduate + 3 years for master&amp;rsquo;s + 3 years for doctorate) with 4 years of non-medical undergraduate education + 4 years of doctoral training&lt;/strong&gt;, aiming to cultivate leading medical professionals with cross-disciplinary expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Celestial Palace&amp;rdquo; attribute is reflected in three dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elite Requirements for Admission:&lt;/strong&gt; Initially, applicants were required to have graduated from universities ranked within the top 50 by QS/Times/US News or among the top 10 US News liberal arts colleges (such as Barnard College). Later, while the requirement was relaxed to include institutions ranked within the top 100, a GPA of 3.6 or higher, or being in the top 30% of their class, remained necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internationalization of training pathways: adopting an American-style organ-system integrated curriculum and PBL teaching method, students must complete core courses such as anatomy and pathology within 4 years, and participate in clinical internships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The controversy surrounding the quality of graduates: Although the pass rate for the national medical licensing examination (95.2%) is slightly lower than the traditional eight-year program (98.5%), most graduates enter hospitals affiliated with Peking Union Medical Center, and their career development shows no significant difference from the traditional path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dong-xi-ying-incident-cracks-in-heavenly-palace-seen-by-ordinary-people&#34;&gt;The Dong Xi-ying Incident: Cracks in &amp;ldquo;Heavenly Palace&amp;rdquo; Seen by Ordinary People
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, a report of extramarital affairs involving Dr. Xiao Fei, a thoracic surgeon at the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital, unexpectedly revealed the &amp;ldquo;mysterious veil&amp;rdquo; surrounding the Peking Union Medical Center&amp;rsquo;s 4+4 project. The resume of the involved party, Dong Xiying, has raised three questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ambiguity of educational background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The controversy surrounding Dong Xiying&amp;rsquo;s academic credentials: she claims to have graduated from Columbia University, but in fact attended its affiliated college, Barnard College (ranked 14th in the 2025 US News liberal arts colleges). Although the school meets Concordia’s “Top 20 Liberal Arts Colleges” requirement, its diploma simultaneously lists &amp;ldquo;Barnard College&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Columbia University,&amp;rdquo; which can easily be mistaken for a degree from Columbia&amp;rsquo;s main campus in the domestic recruitment market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional Cross-Disciplinary Controversy&lt;/strong&gt;: The path of an undergraduate degree in economics combined with a doctorate in clinical medicine, while meeting the &amp;ldquo;multidisciplinary background&amp;rdquo; positioning of the 4+4 program, has been questioned for lacking a foundation in pre-medical coursework. Her doctoral dissertation, &amp;ldquo;Research on Multi-Modal Image Fusion Technology in Medical Image Analysis,&amp;rdquo; has been accused of high similarity to a Beijing University of Science and Technology invention patent, suspected of academic misconduct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particularity of family background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Academic resource monopoly: His father is a secretary at the China Metallurgical Corporation Research Institute, his mother is an associate dean at the Beijing University of Technology Engineering Technology Research Institute, his grandfather is an academician in the field of imaging at Peking Union Medical College, his maternal grandparents are foreign academicians in the field of materials science, and his aunts and uncles are professors at Peking University. This &amp;ldquo;medicine + research + university&amp;rdquo; composite family background provides him with hidden resources such as letters of recommendation (requiring two biomedical associate professors) and scientific research cooperation (such as patents from Beijing University of Technology).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career trajectory jumps: transitioning from thoracic surgery to urology during the residency period, with research spanning multiple fields including orthopedics, gastroenterology, and imaging – leading to accusations of &amp;ldquo;paving the way with resources.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amplification of the debate over the academic system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rationale for time compression: traditional medical doctorates require 11 years (5+3+3), while the 4+4 program compresses this to 8 years. Although Peking Union Medical College emphasizes &amp;ldquo;curriculum integration&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;early clinical exposure,&amp;rdquo; some doctors point out that its clinical internship time (12 months) is still less than the traditional eight-year system (18 months), which may affect skill accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The controversy over internship exemptions: Some internship bases allow 4+4 graduates to be exempted from one year of internship, raising concerns about undermining fairness in the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-predicament-of-medical-education-behind-the-controversy&#34;&gt;The predicament of medical education behind the controversy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dong Xi-ying incident reflects the deep-rooted contradictions in China&amp;rsquo;s medical education system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conflict Between Elitism and Fairness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;application-review system&amp;rdquo; of the 4+4 project is essentially a transplant of the American medical school model, but China lacks standardized exams like the MCAT, and subjective evaluations such as letters of recommendation and research experience are easily influenced by family background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data shows that among the 2023 graduates with a 4+4 program, 30% came from Tsinghua, Peking University, and Fudan University combined, 25% came from overseas prestigious universities, and family background had a significant impact on applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realities of reform in the education system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of time compression: The research output of 4+4 students (such as the number of papers) is significantly lower than that of the traditional eight-year system, and has been criticized for prioritizing clinical practice over research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different levels of recognition within the industry: Top-tier hospitals value the Peking Union Medical Center brand, while community hospitals are cautious about the clinical abilities of 4+4 program graduates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dilemma of Integrating Medical Education with International Standards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US 4+4 model requires passing the MCAT exam and completing a 3-7 year residency, while China&amp;rsquo;s 4+4 program simplifies the admission and residency stages, resulting in a superficial resemblance but not the substance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to data from the Ministry of Education, in the 2024 national enrollment for medical doctoral programs, the proportion of 4+4 projects is less than 5%, and their large-scale promotion still faces obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-reconstructing-the-celestial-palace-order-of-medical-education&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Reconstructing the &amp;ldquo;Celestial Palace&amp;rdquo; Order of Medical Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding the Union 4+4 project is fundamentally a clash between elite education and public expectations. When a corner of &amp;ldquo;Tiangong&amp;rdquo; (meaning space station, metaphorically referring to top-tier medical training) is glimpsed by ordinary people, what&amp;rsquo;s exposed isn&amp;rsquo;t just flaws in individual cases, but deeper contradictions within the entire medical education system. Future reforms need to focus on three levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparent selection mechanisms: Introduce standardized tests (such as a Chinese version of the MCAT) to reduce the influence of subjective factors like letters of recommendation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend the residency training period: Restore the residency training time for 4+4 graduates to 3 years to ensure clinical competency standards are met&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen process supervision: Establish an academic integrity review mechanism and conduct rigorous originality verification for interdisciplinary research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;heavenly palace&amp;rdquo; of medical education should not be the privilege of a few, but rather a cradle for cultivating true medical elites. Only when fairness in selection mechanisms, rigor in the training process, and standardization in career development are comprehensively guaranteed can this “heavenly palace experiment” in medical education truly take root and flourish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Tariff storm, stock market crash</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/tariffs-storm-stock-market-crash/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 03:49:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/tariffs-storm-stock-market-crash/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, global stock markets have experienced sharp volatility, primarily due to the new round of comprehensive tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, which has sparked market concerns about a global trade war and economic recession&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariff policies trigger market panic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump announced last week that he would impose high tariffs on all imported goods, with tariffs of up to 50% on imports from China, aiming to correct what he called an unfair global trade system. This move has led to a panic sell-off in global markets as investors worry that escalating trade tensions will stifle global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global stock markets plunged sharply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, major stock indexes suffered heavy losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,200 points, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 4% and the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index fell 3.8%, entering bear market territory. Asian and European markets were also not spared, with the Nikkei 225 in Japan falling nearly 8% and European stock markets dropping 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors seek safe-haven assets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with market volatility, investors are turning to safe-haven assets such as bonds and the yen. However, the market volatility index (VIX) has surged above 60, indicating heightened market panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists warn of stagflation risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists warn that tariff policies could lead to “stagflation” in the US economy – a situation where economic growth stagnates, inflation rises, and high unemployment coexist. JPMorgan Chase has raised the probability of a recession in the U.S. economy in 2025 to 60%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions from various governments and businesses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments around the world have stated that they will take retaliatory measures. For example, the EU trade commissioner said that it would begin imposing retaliatory tariffs on US goods on April 15th. The business community has also expressed concerns; Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs have raised the probability of a US economic recession to 45%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, global markets are facing unprecedented challenges; investors need to closely monitor trade policy developments and market changes, and manage risks and asset allocation&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Bored and wanting to design a traditional Chinese ink-wash painting style theme</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-ink-style-theme/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 03:42:47 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-ink-style-theme/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m tired of those colorful and flashy homepages, suddenly I want to go for a minimalist style and design a theme in Chinese ink-wash painting style&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the stylesheet is heavily modified, specific styles are configured for different elements to override the theme&amp;rsquo;s default styles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without refactoring, trying to directly generate a new theme using AI results in something that is very unstable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just so happened I ran into the queue for the trae claude large model, switched to VS Code agent mode, and the results were really bad – whatever was modified lacked any sense of design&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s because I don&amp;rsquo;t understand frontend well enough to effectively break down tasks for AI&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Broad-based index investing: Broker ETF, Hang Seng Tech Index</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/etf-wide-index-dzt-broker-etfs-hangsheng-tech-index/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 21:58:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/etf-wide-index-dzt-broker-etfs-hangsheng-tech-index/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to do this – buy a good blue-chip stock and just leave it alone. But I waited for it to fall, didn&amp;rsquo;t add to my position, and sold when it rose. As a result, I never managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s more trouble than it&amp;rsquo;s worth to find suitable blue-chip stocks; instead, just pick a broad market index and buy an ETF. The current plan is: securities ETF, Hang Seng Tech Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trading strategy has a professional term: left-side dip buying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the plan is to choose a broad-based index for thorough practice; it just needs to outperform the returns of fixed deposits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brokerage-etfs&#34;&gt;Brokerage ETFs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securities ETF refers to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with China&amp;rsquo;s securities companies as their primary investment target, primarily investing in listed securities company stocks in the Chinese stock market. Securities ETFs typically track a specific securities company index, such as the Zhongxin Securities Company Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought it before, but I chased after the high price at that time and ended up losing money, so I just cleared out the position. In China&amp;rsquo;s market, every bull market sees securities firms rise; how much they rise depends on the sentiment of investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-technology-index&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Technology Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index is a stock index launched by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, designed to reflect the overall performance of the technology sector in the Hong Kong market. The index includes major tech companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, covering multiple fields such as the internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 20, 2025, the top ten constituents and their respective weightings in the Hang Seng Tech Index (code: 800700) are as follows (data compiled from multiple authoritative sources):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xiaomi Group-W (01810.HK): Approximately 8.82%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tencent Holdings (00700.HK): Approximately 8.14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alibaba Group - W (09988.HK): Approximately 7.72%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JD Group-SW (09618.HK): Approximately 7.60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meituan-W (03690.HK): Approximately 7.35%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kuaishou-W (01024.HK): Approximately 6.10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Auto (02015.HK): Approximately 6.09%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SMIC (00981.HK): Approximately 5.70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NetEase-S (09999.HK): Approximately 4.59%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ctrip Group-S (09961.HK): Approximately 4.48%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 66.6% (Some sources indicate a combined share of the top ten between 68%-69%, with differences due to varying statistical time points)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;important-notes&#34;&gt;Important Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The weighting cap mechanism: The Hang Seng Technology Index sets an 8% upper limit on the weight of individual stocks. For example, SMIC&amp;rsquo;s weighting once exceeded 8% before its March 2025 adjustment, but was subsequently passively reduced to a compliant range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constituent Stock Adjustment: On May 16, 2025, Hang Seng Index Company announced that BYD (01211.HK) will be included in the index and Century Golden Resource (00772.HK) will be removed. The adjustment will take effect on June 6. Therefore, as of today (May 20), the constituent stock list remains the pre-adjustment list, and BYD has not yet been included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Among the top ten constituents, internet technology companies (such as Tencent, Alibaba, and Meituan) are dominant, with significant weighting in new energy vehicles (Xiaomi, Li Auto) and semiconductors (SMIC), reflecting the index&amp;rsquo;s coverage of technology and the new economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data timeliness: Differences in data from different sources are mainly due to varying statistical time points. For example, data from March 2025 shows that the top ten combined accounted for approximately 69.4%, while data from May 14th showed 68.82%, reflecting the dynamic impact of market fluctuations on weighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buy-back-to-cover-losses-on-the-left-side&#34;&gt;Buy back to cover losses on the left side
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;left-side falling price replenishment&amp;rdquo; strategy is an investment approach where, during a period of continuous stock price decline, investors anticipate the price nearing a bottoming zone and proactively purchase in batches to reduce holding costs, awaiting future price rebounds for profit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method falls under the category of &amp;ldquo;left-side trading,&amp;rdquo; which means taking a contrarian position before the market has clearly bottomed out. In practice, investors typically employ a “pyramid” accumulation strategy, gradually increasing their purchase quantity as the price declines to reduce their average holding cost. For example, initially buying a certain number of shares; if the price continues to fall, then increasing the buy volume at a lower price, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce holding costs: By buying in batches during a downturn, average stock cost is diluted, creating conditions for future profits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positioning in advance: Establishing a position before the market reverses; if the judgment is correct, greater returns can be achieved when the market recovers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High risk: Continued decline in stock price may lead to greater losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding requirements: Requires sufficient funds to support continuous replenishment, and may face a situation where funds are locked up for an extended period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively speaking, &amp;ldquo;right-side trading&amp;rdquo; involves entering buy positions after the market trend is clear and there are obvious signs of price recovery, which carries relatively low risk but may miss some of the gains from the early stages of a rebound. Therefore, investors should choose a suitable trading strategy based on their risk tolerance, financial situation, and market judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory&#34;&gt;Valuation theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuation theory is a core concept in finance, designed to assess the intrinsic value of assets or companies and provide a basis for investment decisions. Through valuation, investors can determine whether the current market price of an asset is reasonable and formulate corresponding investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main valuation methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discounted Cash Flow (DCF): This method is based on the expected future cash flows generated by an asset, which are then discounted to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The DCF method emphasizes the intrinsic value of an asset and is suitable for evaluating companies with stable and predictable profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative Valuation: This method assesses a company&amp;rsquo;s relative value by comparing its valuation metrics with those of other companies in the same industry, such as price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-book ratio (P/B), and price-to-sales ratio (P/S). Relative valuation is easy to operate and widely used for quick assessments and comparisons within an industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asset-based approach determines a company&amp;rsquo;s value by assessing its net asset value, which is the difference between total assets and liabilities. This method is suitable for asset-dominant companies such as real estate firms or capital-intensive businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application of Valuation Theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment decisions: Through valuation, investors can identify undervalued or overvalued assets and formulate buy-or-sell strategies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mergers and Acquisitions: In M&amp;amp;A transactions, valuation is key to determining the transaction price and influencing the success or failure of the deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Report: The company needs to assess its assets and liabilities at fair value to ensure the accuracy and transparency of financial reports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that valuation results are affected by various factors, including market conditions, company operating status, and macroeconomic indicators. Therefore, when conducting a valuation, it is necessary to comprehensively consider all factors and combine qualitative and quantitative analysis to obtain more accurate assessment results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Design and develop a customizable stock selection module without coding</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/no-code-design-develop-custom-stock-module/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:20:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/no-code-design-develop-custom-stock-module/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month we tested Cursor, but due to limitations on the free tier, we didn&amp;rsquo;t do any complex feature development, just some simple testing. At that time, we also discovered that ByteDance released a similar product, and both used the same underlying large language model – Claude-3.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byte&amp;rsquo;s product is called Trae, first launched for Mac, and finally released a Windows version this February. Products from big companies are just good – you can use them for free, without paying, with unlimited access to Claude-3.5. This model has a very nice effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I got stuck on the development of the K-line chart. Due to my basic lack of knowledge in React, I had to give up. To continue developing it, I need to supplement some fundamental front-end knowledge and break down the tasks more finely, rather than giving a large task: develop the K-line chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;issues-found&#34;&gt;Issues found
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to insufficient training data for Vue3 + Element-Plus due to the use of foreign AI models, we chose React as the front-end framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There may be occasional grammatical errors that need manual correction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solutions to some complex problems require human guidance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code structure optimization requires human guidance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most time-consuming part was packaging the frontend code into a container. As the author has no foundation, I had no concept of &lt;code&gt;.env.production&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt;. I only managed to understand the corresponding logic with help from Bean. There&amp;rsquo;s a big difference in how the frontend development (dev) mode and build mode check the code. The container scripts for the backend database and services took about five minutes altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, AI primarily improves development efficiency; having a foundation is best, as AI won&amp;rsquo;t solve all your problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;warehouse-address&#34;&gt;Warehouse address
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the title says, this time we&amp;rsquo;re avoiding writing code and directly engaging with AI to design and develop a customizable stock selection module. Let’s see what kind of results we can achieve in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repository address: [https://github.com/ttf248/trae-demo]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed usage instructions can be found in the README.md file in the repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warehouse contains many submission records, mostly conversations between me and Trae, as well as my tests of some of Trae&amp;rsquo;s functions, with notes indicating whether manual intervention was required to achieve the corresponding functionality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt&#34;&gt;Prompt
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project was created from scratch, here&amp;rsquo;s the prompt for the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;基于项目原型图，开发功能：自选股，需要支持合约的新增、删除、修改、查询。自选股界面需要展示基础的行情数据。支持多个不同的市场切换。

前端：react
后端：golang gin gorm
数据库：PostgreSQL

服务端需要支持跨域请求，同时需要考虑数据的校验和错误处理，如果后端服务不可用，前端需要告警提示。

后端需要展示请求和应答的日志；前端也打印通讯的日志，方便排查问题。
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ui-and-interaction-optimization&#34;&gt;UI and interaction optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design of the front-end interface is completely dependent on Grok. We first created a prototype in Trae, but it lacked aesthetic appeal. Due to the model&amp;rsquo;s strong coding capabilities but relatively weak other abilities, we need to use Grok to optimize the front-end UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking a screenshot of the current interface, uploading it to Grok, and having it help us optimize the UI, we can potentially receive many optimization suggestions at once. We will manually evaluate them and then copy them into Trae for execution, observing the effects of the optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;technology-stack&#34;&gt;Technology stack
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend: React + TypeScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backend: Golang + Gin + GORM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database: PostgreSQL 17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;system-architecture&#34;&gt;System architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;backend-architecture&#34;&gt;Backend architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backend is implemented using the Go Gin framework for a RESTful API, with main modules including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database module&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use GORM as an ORM framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support configuring database connections through environment variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically migrate database tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Routing module&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESTful API Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unified error handling mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in request logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-domain handling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support cross-domain in local development environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configurable CORS policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support cross-domain cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Two years of AI development: somewhat similar to the state before Docker was released</title>

        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:16:37 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-docker-pre-release/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been one of the most discussed topics in the technology field in recent years, especially with the rapid advancements in AI technology over the past two years. From deep learning and natural language processing to computer vision and automated decision-making systems, applications of AI are constantly emerging. However, despite continuous technological breakthroughs, AI still faces a bottleneck similar to that before Docker&amp;rsquo;s release – a lack of a killer application to truly ignite the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of AI over the past two years is somewhat similar to the state before Docker was released – it lacks a killer application. Based on existing technologies, we need to create a perfect practical scenario. Docker didn&amp;rsquo;t rely heavily on new technologies, but the entire solution was very reasonable and changed the workflows for operations and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-current-state-of-ai-development-technology-is-mature-but-application-still-needs-breakthroughs&#34;&gt;The current state of AI development: technology is mature, but application still needs breakthroughs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, AI has made considerable progress in the past two years. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT series models or Google&amp;rsquo;s BERT and DeepMind&amp;rsquo;s Alpha series, AI&amp;rsquo;s processing capabilities have far exceeded previous expectations. Especially in the field of natural language processing, models like GPT-4 not only possess powerful generation capabilities but also demonstrate astonishing performance in understanding and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite the rapid advancement of technology, the practical application of AI faces certain challenges. Similar to the state before Docker was released, although AI has great potential, a truly widespread and industry-transforming killer application hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet emerged. People are talking about the prospects of AI, but may not be able to find an application scenario that can directly bring revolutionary change. Many AI applications are still in the initial trial stage, and most require further integration and optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-similarity-between-docker-and-ai-technology-isnt-necessarily-innovation-solutions-are-key&#34;&gt;The similarity between Docker and AI: Technology isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily innovation, solutions are key
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the history before Docker&amp;rsquo;s release, we can easily see that the technological environment and the current state of AI development share many similarities. Before Docker was released, container technology wasn&amp;rsquo;t a new concept; early LXC (Linux Containers) and virtualization technologies already possessed basic containerization capabilities. However, Docker cleverly integrated and optimized existing technologies to propose a simpler, more intuitive, and efficient solution. This approach didn’t introduce any groundbreaking technologies but solved many pain points in operations and development processes, greatly simplifying the deployment, scaling, and management of software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the AI field faces similar circumstances. While current AI technology is no longer a &amp;ldquo;novelty,&amp;rdquo; achieving truly large-scale applications still requires a perfect landing scenario – like Docker – to integrate and optimize existing technologies into a reasonable application plan. The killer application of AI may not depend on entirely new technological breakthroughs, but rather on how to solve real business pain points and needs by integrating existing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-ais-docker-moment&#34;&gt;How to find AI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Docker moment&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly achieve widespread application of AI technology, efforts need to be made in several areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-depth exploration of real-world scenarios
Currently, many AI applications are still experimental in nature and lack large-scale practical implementation. For example, while AI customer service and intelligent recommendation fields have widespread applications, their functions still have many limitations and haven&amp;rsquo;t yet overcome industry bottlenecks. Real breakthroughs may come from industries long troubled by traditional methods, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics, where AI can help businesses improve efficiency and reduce costs through more efficient data processing and predictive analysis in these complex scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productization and Usability
Just as Docker improves operational efficiency by simplifying the containerization process, the usability of AI products is equally crucial. The popularization of AI isn&amp;rsquo;t just about the spread of technology; it’s about the popularization of its productization. Integrating AI into daily workflows and allowing users to easily use these tools without needing a deep understanding of the underlying technology is an important step in implementing AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecological Construction and Standardization
The widespread adoption of any new technology is inseparable from ecosystem development. Docker&amp;rsquo;s rapid rise is precisely due to its openness and compatibility, allowing developers to easily connect with various cloud platforms, tools, and services. Similarly, the future of AI depends on building an ecosystem. The standardization of AI, model sharing, data openness, and technical integrability will all influence whether AI can form widespread industry applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-the-future-of-ai-is-full-of-possibilities-but-a-more-complete-landing-plan-is-still-needed&#34;&gt;Conclusion: The future of AI is full of possibilities, but a more complete landing plan is still needed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although AI technology has made significant progress in the past two years, it is still in a stage of “lacking a killer application.” Similar to containerization technology before Docker’s release, AI needs a reasonable application scenario that deeply integrates existing technologies with business needs in order to truly achieve large-scale application and popularization. While technological innovation is important, solutions that simplify processes and improve efficiency are better at driving the adoption and development of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, AI may be like Docker—not through revolutionary technological breakthroughs, but by integrating existing technologies to create a perfect application scenario, ultimately changing the way we work and live&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Protobuf Zero-Value Trap: When Defaults Become Silent Killers of Business Logic</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/protobuf-zero-value-traps/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:26:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/protobuf-zero-value-traps/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;US stocks have three trading periods: pre-market, intra-market, and after-hours. The data push interface uses an incremental logic (to minimize bandwidth usage), sending the full dataset only once initially, and then pushing all subsequent fields as increments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not use the optimal solution? It involves different project teams, some of which have been live for many years. We are newly connected, so we can only try our best to ensure compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-series-of-questions&#34;&gt;A series of questions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the abstract alone, there might not seem to be any issues. However, bringing the system architecture into the problem-solving group has led to a series of problems. Just as one problem was resolved, a new one emerged, and this new problem stemmed from the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unable-to-identify-trading-period&#34;&gt;Unable to identify trading period
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The known issue is that the stage in the table is defined as 0 in &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;, but due to incremental push when receiving data, the business side cannot effectively identify whether this 0 is a default value or a real business value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A layman&amp;rsquo;s understanding: Each time we receive a 0, it’s impossible to determine whether this 0 is the value of a newly set quote or the default value of Protobuf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduce-optional&#34;&gt;Introduce optional
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since protobuf release 3.15, proto3 supports using the optional keyword (just as in proto2) to give a scalar field presence information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communication protocol within the group is based on &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;, but due to historical reasons, an older version was chosen that doesn&amp;rsquo;t support the &lt;code&gt;optional&lt;/code&gt; keyword. Those who understand know that because &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; was introduced from the bottom up and the project is released as a static library, upgrading the entire compilation chain would be very costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gcc-version-issue&#34;&gt;GCC version issue
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After much effort, we devised a plan to release two different versions at the underlying level, attempting to control the propagation of compilation dependencies for the new version of &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;. However, during compilation, we discovered that the &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version was too low and did not support the new features of &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commonly used server types within the group: CentOS 7, CentOS 8. The default &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version for CentOS 7 is 4.8, and the default &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version for CentOS 8 is 8.3. Because new features of &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; require a &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version above 7.4, CentOS 7 cannot be supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=82461&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bug 82461 - [7 Regression] Temporary required for brace-initializing (non-literal-type) member variable&lt;/a&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some troubleshooting, I moved the deployment and compilation servers for related services to CentOS 8, which resolved the issue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reasonable-enumeration&#34;&gt;Reasonable enumeration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the whole issue, there&amp;rsquo;s actually a simpler and more efficient solution: adjust the enumeration definition to start numbering from 1 instead of 0. This can effectively distinguish between default values and business values, avoiding the aforementioned series of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-is-it-more-reasonable-to-start-from-1&#34;&gt;Why is it more reasonable to start from 1?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;, enumeration types default to a value of 0. If we define a meaningful business value as 0 (for example, &amp;ldquo;in-play&amp;rdquo;), the receiving party cannot determine whether the received 0 is a business value or an unset default value during incremental push. However, if we start defining enumerations from 1, 0 can be reserved for a meaningless default value or an &amp;ldquo;unknown&amp;rdquo; state, and the problem is easily resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggested practices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When designing protobuf enums, always define 0 as a meaningless default value (such as &lt;code&gt;UNKNOWN&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;RESERVED&lt;/code&gt;)
Assign actual business values starting from 1, ensuring they are distinct from the default value of 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small adjustment not only resolved the issue of identifying trading periods, but also provided a valuable lesson for future protocol design&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A dramatic shift of icy and fiery in the stock market before and after National Day</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/national-holiday-stock-market-rollercoaster/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:42:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/national-holiday-stock-market-rollercoaster/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of China&amp;rsquo;s National Day in 2024, the stock market experienced a remarkable surge, but after the holiday, the market faced a dramatic plunge. This &amp;ldquo;rollercoaster&amp;rdquo; experience for investors has also prompted deep reflection on policy, economics, and market dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the theme, write a blog post about the stock market surge before last year&amp;rsquo;s National Day holiday, and be sure to include the subsequent sharp decline after the holiday. Article style: news report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-surge-before-national-day-a-policy-driven-frenzy&#34;&gt;Stock market surge before National Day: A policy-driven frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the five trading days leading up to China&amp;rsquo;s National Day in 2024, the Chinese stock market surged from a sluggish state into &amp;ldquo;boiling mode.&amp;rdquo; On September 30th, A-share markets across the board saw significant gains, with major indices reaching record highs. The Shanghai Index rose 8.06%, the Shenzhen Component Index increased by 10.67%, and the Growth Enterprise Market Index soared 15.36%. The Bilibili BELEX 50 Index even set a historic record for the largest single-day increase, jumping 22.84%. Market sentiment was extremely exuberant, with turnover on the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing exchanges reaching 2.6115 trillion yuan, a significant increase of 115.59 billion yuan compared to the previous trading day. More than 5300 stocks across the market rose collectively, creating a &amp;ldquo;sea of red&amp;rdquo; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core driving force behind this recent market trend stems from the concentrated release of a series of unexpected policies by the government and the resulting shifts in market expectations. On September 24th, the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China announced measures including reducing the reserve requirement ratio, lowering interest rates, and decreasing mortgage rates for existing loans, as well as unifying the minimum down payment ratio for mortgages. The Central Political Bureau meeting on September 26th emphasized the need to strengthen counter-cyclical adjustments through fiscal and monetary policies, work hard to boost the capital market, and vigorously guide long-term funds into the market. On September 30th, a cluster of four real estate support policies were introduced. These measures demonstrate the government&amp;rsquo;s determination to stabilize the market and promote economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-stock-markets-sharp-decline-after-national-day-calmness-and-adjustment-following-the-revelry&#34;&gt;The stock market&amp;rsquo;s sharp decline after National Day: Calmness and adjustment following the revelry
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, market sentiment took a sharp turn downward after the National Day holiday. On October 8th, A-shares opened strongly with gains nearing the daily limit, but following this significant opening rally, the market experienced violent volatility and ultimately closed higher than it opened but lower than it started. Since then, the market focus has continued to decline; as of October 16th, the Shanghai Composite Index had a fluctuation rate exceeding 15% and cumulatively fell by more than 470 points. From October 8th to 10th, core A-share indices across the board declined, with the Growth Enterprise Market Index falling by 6.21%.
The reasons for this sharp decline are partly the digestion of accumulated risks from previous rapid gains, and partly related to adjustments in market expectations regarding policies. Some investors believe that the short-term effects of policies have already become apparent, but long-term results still need to be observed. In addition, volatility in overseas markets has also impacted A shares. On October 9th, the Hang Seng Index plummeted 9.41%, and the A50 futures contract fell 10.4%, further exacerbating the market&amp;rsquo;s decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflection-on-and-prospects-for-the-market&#34;&gt;Reflection on and Prospects for the Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp volatility of the stock market before and after National Day has prompted deep reflection on policy, economy, and market mechanisms. On one hand, the short-term stimulating effects of policies are evident, but their long-term impact remains to be seen. On the other hand, the rapid rise and fall of the market also remind investors to remain rational and avoid emotional investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether A-share market can achieve a genuine “long-term bull” trend still depends on whether policies can effectively transmit to the real economy and ultimately drive substantial improvements in economic fundamentals. Investors should closely monitor the specific implementation of policies and changes in economic data, and reasonably adjust their investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp rise and fall of the stock market before and after National Day was a game between policy and the market, as well as a test of investor psychology. In this &amp;ldquo;extreme&amp;rdquo; market environment, we have witnessed both the power of the market and the influence of policy. How the market will unfold in the future remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Nezha breaks out during Spring Festival season</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-nizha-breakthrough/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:40:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-nizha-breakthrough/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As Chinese people, we always gather as a family during the Spring Festival and watching movies has become an essential form of entertainment. This year&amp;rsquo;s Spring Festival season, &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; was incredibly popular, sparking discussions everywhere. The buzz is quite similar to that of &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior,&amp;rdquo; both films exuding a patriotic theme, which unexpectedly stirs up a sense of national pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unexpected success of &amp;ldquo;Nezha&amp;rdquo; during the Spring Festival season, a surge of inexplicable national pride, reminiscent of previous films like &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior,&amp;rdquo; with patriotic themes. While acknowledging significant progress, it&amp;rsquo;s not as good as it’s being made out to be. As a gamer, many aspects feel greasy. The fight scenes are heavily influenced by online games. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen numerous posts about people buying tickets for Nezha but not actually going to see the movie due to its box office performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fight-scenes-lack-texture&#34;&gt;The fight scenes lack texture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a gamer, and I usually spend my days immersed in various online game worlds, so I didn’t have high expectations for movies. But I couldn’t resist the hype around 《Moana》, everyone was talking about it, so I thought, why not take a look? When I walked into the theater and the visuals came on, I felt a “thud” in my heart. Although the production quality has improved considerably compared to before, some of the scenes looked quite greasy. And the fight scenes? They were too heavily influenced by online games. Having played games for so many years, this visual style is too similar to some game scenes, lacking the texture that a movie should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crazy-movie-fans&#34;&gt;Crazy movie fans
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the movie, I came out and saw that quite a few people online said they bought tickets for &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; but didn&amp;rsquo;t actually watch it, all to boost its box office. I’m truly impressed by this move; it seems everyone is incredibly enthusiastic about this film and willing to do anything for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s think back to when &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; came out, when Wu Jing shouted, “Whoever dares offend China will be punished no matter how far away they are,” so many people were filled with excitement, feeling that our Chinese military was so powerful and our country so strong. Although &amp;ldquo;The Devil’s Bond&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t have such direct patriotic slogans, it vividly showcases the essence of traditional Chinese culture. Nezha and Ao Bing, these mythological figures, we grew up listening to their stories, and the film portrays their grievances, love-hate relationships, and growth process with depth and emotion – isn’t that the charm of Chinese culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Nezha. Misunderstood and looked down upon since he was a child, yet he refused to give up, shouting &amp;ldquo;My fate is my own, not the heavens’.&amp;rdquo; This spirit is so much like the resilience ingrained in our Chinese people. No matter how great the difficulties we face, we won&amp;rsquo;t bow down, but rely on our own efforts to change our destiny. Ao Bing also exemplifies this – burdened with a family mission, seemingly cold but actually kind-hearted, willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. We often see such friendship and responsibility in real life, don’t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-progress-of-animated-films&#34;&gt;The progress of animated films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect in some aspects, it combines traditional Chinese culture with modern film technology quite well, allowing us to see the progress of Chinese animated films. Just like how &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; showed everyone China’s breakthrough in the action genre. This kind of progress makes us feel that Chinese cinema can shine on the international stage and allow foreigners to appreciate the brilliance of Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chinese people, no matter where we go, we carry our country and culture in our hearts. Movies like &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; are like keys, opening the door to a sense of national pride deep within us. They allow us to feel the strength of our nation and the charm of our culture amidst laughter and joy, also inspiring us to work hard in our respective positions and contribute our share to the prosperity and development of our country. This is probably why these films have become so popular and resonate with a sense of national pride. In the future, I hope there will be more movies like this, keeping this feeling of national pride full and overflowing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Troubleshooting TCP Communication Abnormalities in Backend Services</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:54:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The business model involves backend services establishing a connection with the group&amp;rsquo;s market gateway via TCP. Each connection requires sending an authorization request first, followed by continuously sending heartbeat packets to maintain the connection status.
However, one day, we received an alert message indicating a service disconnection. After carefully checking the logs, we discovered that the backend service was continuously sending heartbeat packets, but there was no response from the other party, yet the connection never disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-description-of-the-scene&#34;&gt;Brief description of the scene
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was originally working overtime at the company to push forward project progress when an alarm message suddenly popped up in the work group. At first glance, I thought it was just the usual issue – likely a network timeout causing heartbeat failures and subsequently disconnecting the service. However, after carefully checking the logs, I found that the actual situation was not like that. The backend had sent authorization login messages, but received no response. Meanwhile, heartbeats continued to be sent incessantly, yet the other party never replied with any heartbeat data. In-depth analysis of the logs revealed the following key issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorization message received no response: It is very likely that the other party&amp;rsquo;s system is restarting, preventing the authorization message from being processed in a timely manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The heartbeat data was sent even though authorization failed: After investigation, we found a flaw in the program logic. The judgment logic of the heartbeat sending function is flawed; it only checks the connection status but overlooks the authorization status check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the service can be disconnected, it will trigger a reconnection mechanism and resend the authorization message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there remains one last urgent issue that needs resolving—why the connection has not been disconnected. Solving this problem requires more in-depth and detailed troubleshooting work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analyzing-network-packets&#34;&gt;Analyzing network packets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; is a very powerful network packet capture tool that can be used to capture network data packets. By analyzing these network data packets, we can gain a more intuitive understanding of the details of network communication. Here, we can use &lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; to capture network data packets for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/20250220151952.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1126&#34;
	height=&#34;202&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;557&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;1337px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the data in the graph, I can see that the heartbeat is consistently being sent, but the other server isn&amp;rsquo;t responding with any data, yet it’s sending an &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;. This prevents the connection from disconnecting on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;common-flag-explanations&#34;&gt;Common Flag Explanations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the TCP protocol, &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; (Push) and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; (Acknowledgment) are two important flags used to control data transmission and flow confirmation. Their functions are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-pshpush-flag&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. PSH（Push Flag）&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features
The purpose of the &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; flag is to &lt;strong&gt;request that the receiver immediately push data from the buffer to the upper layer application&lt;/strong&gt; (instead of waiting for the buffer to fill up). This means that once a data segment with the &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; flag is received, the receiver will process and pass it to the application as quickly as possible, rather than storing it in the operating system buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical Scenarios&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTTP/HTTPS requests: When a client sends a request (such as &lt;code&gt;GET /index.html&lt;/code&gt;), it sets the &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; flag, hoping that the server will respond immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SSH protocol: Each keyboard input triggers a &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt;, ensuring that input characters are transmitted in real-time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-time communication: Low-latency scenarios such as video streams and online games may use &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; to reduce latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSH is not mandatory; the receiving party can choose to ignore this flag (but still needs to process the data normally)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sender may not set the &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt;, in which case the receiver will decide when to push data based on its own buffering strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-ackacknowledgment-flag&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. ACK（Acknowledgment Flag）&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features
The ACK flag indicates that &lt;strong&gt;the preceding segment of data has been received correctly&lt;/strong&gt;. Each ACK contains an acknowledgment number (Acknowledgment Number), which represents the next expected byte sequence number. It is a core mechanism for reliable transmission in TCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working principle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the sender sends a data segment, it carries the expected receiver&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; value (for example, &lt;code&gt;ACK = sequence number + data length&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon receiving data, the receiver generates an &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; segment confirming the received sequence number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sender will only retransmit unacknowledged data after receiving the corresponding ACK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the sender sends a data segment with sequence number &lt;code&gt;100~199&lt;/code&gt;, the expected &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; from the receiver should be &lt;code&gt;200&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the receiving party fails to receive some of the data within the range of &lt;code&gt;100~199&lt;/code&gt;, it will inform the sending party to retransmit via &lt;code&gt;ACK=150&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-combination-of-psh-and-ack&#34;&gt;The combination of PSH and ACK
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In TCP packets, &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; can appear simultaneously, commonly seen in the following scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP request response
When the client sends a &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request (with data), it sets &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; (acknowledgment of previous responses)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-plaintext&#34;&gt;Client → Server: SYN, ACK=1 → 建立连接
Client → Server: PSH, ACK=1, 数据 → 发送请求数据
Server → Client: PSH, ACK=数据长度+1 → 返回响应
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transmit commands after SSH handshake
After the client enters a command, it sends a data segment with &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; to ensure that the command is immediately transmitted and processed by the server&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-flag-bit-associations&#34;&gt;Other flag bit associations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Flag&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Brief Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SYN Synchronization Initialization Connection (Three-Way Handshake)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;FIN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;End&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Gracefully close connection&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reset&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Force connection termination (abnormal situation)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mark urgent pointer (rarely used)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSH focuses on getting data to the application layer as quickly as possible, reducing latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACK focuses on reliable data transmission, avoiding packet loss or out-of-order delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They work together to balance the efficiency and reliability of the TCP protocol&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Making money takes time; rushing it is useless</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:30:24 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking back on my years of stock trading experience, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t made a lot of money, I haven&amp;rsquo;t lost too much either. The biggest problem lies in the unreasonable capital flow planning and unstable mindset. Currently, my main source of income is work, earning a fixed salary through daily labor, and my tolerance for financial fluctuations still remains at the level of bonds and bank deposits. However, people are greedy; if you buy too little, you won&amp;rsquo;t make money even when prices rise; if you buy too much, you’ll lose money when they fall. At this point, a stable mindset becomes particularly important, as it can help us steady our ship of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing an article: The issue of mentality in stock investment and wealth management&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-loss-cases&#34;&gt;Historical Loss Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides dabbling in small-cap and newly listed stocks when I first started, the subsequent investments have mostly been in blue-chip large-cap stocks: Industrial Bank, China Unicom, Hengan Electronics, ZTE, and various large-cap index funds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They talk about matching bank three-year fixed deposits in terms of annualized returns, but in reality, it&amp;rsquo;s still greed for more, from rushing to increase holdings to eventually experiencing a cash flow shortage. Purchasing insurance, buying a house, and getting married are major drains on funds; the overall planning didn’t leave enough room for cash flow, leading to insufficient funds later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying blue-chip stocks is aligning yourself with &amp;ldquo;Old Money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Evergrande ran into problems, bank stocks plummeted, allowing for a successful grasp of the selling pressure. However, this demonstrates a flawed understanding of the broader economy; real estate&amp;rsquo;s share in the national economy is too large, involving too many things to allow for a &lt;strong&gt;hard landing&lt;/strong&gt;. Subsequently, the stock market continued its decline, and dividend stocks like &lt;strong&gt;Industrial Bank&lt;/strong&gt; rose steadily for about two years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the initial stage of the trade war, &lt;strong&gt;ZTE&lt;/strong&gt; suffered a major blow, with its stock price plummeting significantly, but it gradually recovered afterward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hang Seng Electronics used to be part of a larger group, and the stock price dropped significantly after Ant Financial spun off. However, this stock is controlled by market makers, and it can surge several times each year. With reasonable position control, losses will be minimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;greed-the-monster-that-devours-reason&#34;&gt;Greed: The &amp;ldquo;Monster&amp;rdquo; That Devours Reason
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greed is the most common problem in stock trading psychology. When stock prices rise steadily and investors&amp;rsquo; paper profits continue to increase, greed quietly takes root. Many people, even when the price has already reached a high level, still fantasize about it continuing to rise, eager to obtain more gains, and are reluctant to take profits. They are blinded by greed, forgetting the laws of the market and the existence of risk. For example, in some speculative hype on popular themes, some investors see prices doubling or even multiplying several times in the short term and become deeply involved, continuously increasing their holdings, hoping to be the last winner. However, the market will not remain bullish forever; when the bubble bursts and prices plummet, these greed-driven investors often suffer heavy losses. Greed robs them of their ability to analyze and make decisions rationally, turning them into &amp;ldquo;gamblers&amp;rdquo; in the stock market rather than wise investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-shackles-that-bind-your-hands-and-feet&#34;&gt;Fear: Shackles that bind your hands and feet
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is the opposite of greed. Fear is equally destructive in the stock market. When market conditions turn sharply downward and stock prices fall significantly, investors are easily caught up in panic. This fear causes them to lose confidence in the market, and even if they hold fundamentally sound stocks, they rush to sell at a loss out of fear of further losses. For example, during the global financial crisis, the share prices of many high-quality blue-chip stocks also fell sharply with the broader market. Some investors were overwhelmed by fear, failing to see the long-term value of these companies and selling their shares at extremely low prices, resulting in missed opportunities for substantial returns from subsequent market rebounds and company performance growth. Fear not only causes investors to suffer losses in the short term but can also leave them with a lasting psychological shadow, making them hesitant to re-enter the market and thus missing out on investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blindly-following-trends-a-fog-that-obscures-direction&#34;&gt;Blindly following trends: A &amp;ldquo;fog&amp;rdquo; that obscures direction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stock trading and wealth management, blindly following the crowd is another psychological trap that investors easily fall into. In this era of information explosion, various investment suggestions, market rumors, and hot news abound. Many investors lack independent thinking and judgment skills, blindly following others&amp;rsquo; actions. They see those around them making money by buying a certain stock and impulsively follow suit; they hear so-called &amp;ldquo;insider information&amp;rdquo; and invest all their savings. This blind following behavior ignores the research and analysis of the stocks themselves, leaving investors like ships lost in fog, losing their direction. For example, some concept stocks can indeed bring short-term gains to those who follow the trend at the beginning of market hype, but as the hype fades, the stock price plummets, and those who are uninformed and blindly following become &amp;ldquo;catchers&amp;rdquo; (those who buy after a decline). They fail to realize that each investor has different risk tolerance, investment goals, and investment horizons; an investment strategy suitable for others may not be suitable for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overconfidence-a-hidden-shoal&#34;&gt;Overconfidence: A Hidden &amp;ldquo;Shoal&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence is also a problem that cannot be ignored in the mindset of stock trading and wealth management. Some investors, after achieving several investment successes, begin to become inflated with pride, believing they have mastered the laws of the market and can accurately predict stock price movements. They ignore the complexity and uncertainty of the market, overtrade, blindly expand their investments, and even use high leverage for speculation. However, the market is unpredictable, and investors who are overly confident often suffer heavy losses in an unexpected market fluctuation. For example, some inexperienced but initially successful investors believe they have professional investment capabilities and begin to frequently buy and sell stocks, constantly increasing their investment amounts. When systemic risks appear or individual stocks experience sudden negative news, they fail to stop their losses in time due to overconfidence, leading to a significant reduction in capital. Overconfidence is like hidden reefs beneath the surface of the sea—seemingly calm and harmless, but capable of causing an investor&amp;rsquo;s ship of fortune to run aground and sink unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-and-invest-steadily&#34;&gt;How to adjust your mindset and invest steadily
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a correct investment philosophy: Investors should understand that stock trading and wealth management are for achieving long-term, stable asset appreciation, not getting rich quick. By learning about investment knowledge, understanding market rules, and establishing the principles of value investing and long-term investing, investors can avoid being swayed by short-term gains and market sentiment. For example, thoroughly research a company&amp;rsquo;s fundamentals, focusing on factors such as its profitability, industry position, and management team, to select stocks with long-term investment value rather than blindly chasing short-term trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a sound investment plan: Based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals, formulate a scientific and reasonable investment plan. Clearly define key elements such as investment amount, investment horizon, expected return, and stop-loss point, and strictly adhere to the plan. This can help avoid impulsive decisions driven by emotional fluctuations during the investment process. For example, limit the investment proportion of each stock to a certain percentage of your total assets, take profits when the price rises to meet your expected return, and cut losses decisively when it reaches the stop-loss point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control your emotions and stay calm: When facing market fluctuations, learn to control your emotions and remain calm and rational. You can relieve investment pressure through methods such as diverting attention, exercising, and communicating with others, avoiding negative emotional influences on investment decisions. When the market experiences significant volatility, first calmly analyze the reasons, combine your own investment strategy and stock fundamentals, and make a rational judgment instead of blindly following the trend or panicking to sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous learning and reflection: The stock market is constantly evolving, so investors need to continuously learn new investment knowledge and skills, pay attention to macroeconomic conditions, industry trends, and company information, and constantly improve their investment level. At the same time, they should regularly reflect on their own investment behavior, summarize experiences and lessons, identify problems in mindset and decision-making, and make timely adjustments and improvements. For example, after each investment, review the entire investment process, analyze the reasons for success and failure, and think about how to avoid similar mistakes in future investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in stocks and managing finances is a long and challenging journey, where mindset plays a crucial role. Only by maintaining a rational, calm, humble, and independent thinking approach can investors navigate the ups and downs of the stock market steadily and achieve wealth preservation and appreciation. Investors should regard cultivating their mindset as a mandatory course in the investment process, using a positive attitude to steer their financial ship and ensure long-term success on the path of stock investing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Alternative fantasies and emotional attachments weathered by time</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 22:12:57 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the earliest online literature readers enter middle age, the types of stories they enjoy have also changed. Protagonists now frequently appear as fathers, mentors, or elderly individuals, catering to middle-aged readers&amp;rsquo; different needs regarding life and emotions. These works no longer solely focus on leveling up and defying the odds; instead, they emphasize emotional resonance and reflections on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;target-audience-the-evolving-readership-over-time&#34;&gt;Target audience: The evolving readership over time
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once avid online literature readers, most have now entered middle age. They&amp;rsquo;ve experienced the trials of life and their mindset and values have changed. The passionate narratives and adventurous themes they once cherished are no longer their sole pursuit. Instead, they seek emotional resonance that aligns with their current lives, as well as memories of past years and expectations for the future. Middle-aged &amp;ldquo;refreshing&amp;rdquo; novels emerged from this psychological need, attracting readers within this specific demographic through storylines more relatable to middle-aged life and mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;character-transformation-from-youthful-hero-to-middle-aged-responsibility&#34;&gt;Character transformation: from youthful hero to middle-aged responsibility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Apprentice Are All Big Villains: After becoming a master, the protagonist Lu Zhou faces a group of apprentices with diverse personalities and powerful abilities. They waver between good and evil, and Lu Zhou needs to guide them towards righteousness. This novel depicts the challenges and perplexities faced by a middle-aged person when teaching the next generation through interactions between the protagonist and his apprentices. At the same time, the growth and transformation of the apprentices allows readers to see hope and the future, as if seeing their own expectations for their children or the younger generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emotional-resonance-reflections-on-life-and-family-responsibility&#34;&gt;Emotional Resonance: Reflections on Life and Family Responsibility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A protagonist gains a system on their sixtieth birthday, embarking on a new life journey. This premise allows middle-aged readers to feel a sense of &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not too late&amp;rdquo; hope and inspiration. Even though the protagonist is already in their later years, they can still realize their value and dreams through the system. This storyline reminds readers of opportunities missed and unfulfilled dreams in their own lives, while also conveying a positive attitude towards life and encouraging them to never give up on pursuing their goals at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-design-reflecting-the-rhythm-and-fun-of-middle-aged-life&#34;&gt;Plot design: Reflecting the rhythm and fun of middle-aged life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plots in mid-life &amp;ldquo;refreshing&amp;rdquo; novels often pay more attention to the details of life and the nuanced expression of emotions. They no longer pursue the fast-paced leveling up and adventure characteristic of younger refreshing stories, but instead focus on relationships and emotional entanglements between characters. For example, in “The Strongest Master,” the friendship between the protagonist and his apprentice, as well as the brotherhood among fellow disciples, are all depicted with care. This type of plot design allows mid-life readers to feel a sense of warmth and familiarity, as if seeing their own family, friendships, and love reflected in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Mystery of Spring Festival Movie Ticket Prices: Differences Between Online and Offline Sales</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/spring-festival-movie-tickets-price-mystery-online-vs-offline/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:02:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/spring-festival-movie-tickets-price-mystery-online-vs-offline/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the Spring Festival, a family of seven or eight people wanted to go see a movie. We initially planned to buy tickets on Taopihao and Maoyan, but saw the price was 60 yuan. Luckily, we had a cinema recharge card that required purchasing tickets at the front desk in person. Thinking to ask if there were any discounts, we were surprised to find that the same showing only cost 35 yuan when bought at the front desk – quite a difference in price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hidden-markups-on-platform-service-fees&#34;&gt;Hidden markups on platform service fees
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While online ticketing platforms offer convenience, their service fees are not insignificant. They create a user-friendly ticket purchasing experience, such as precise seat selection and the ability to view purchase history at any time, all of which require financial investment for maintenance. These costs are added to the ticket price in the form of platform service fees, resulting in higher online ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cinema-differentiation-operating-strategy&#34;&gt;Cinema Differentiation Operating Strategy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand for moviegoing during the Spring Festival season is surging, and theaters are using tiered pricing to maximize profits. Online platforms have high traffic, and many people are accustomed to buying tickets in advance online, so theaters set higher prices for those tickets; however, they offer lower prices to attract walk-in customers who purchase tickets directly at the front desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pricing-logic-behind-profit-sharing-cooperation&#34;&gt;The pricing logic behind profit sharing cooperation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The split of revenue between online platforms and cinemas affects ticket prices. Online platforms need to take a share from the box office, so they raise ticket prices to ensure profitability. Cinema counters sell tickets directly without any intermediary links, reducing costs, and naturally offering more affordable prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips-for-consumers-buying-tickets&#34;&gt;Tips for Consumers Buying Tickets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t just focus on online platforms when buying tickets in the future. Try calling the cinema front desk to ask about prices, or go directly to the front desk for inquiries – you might be surprised. If you’re a frequent moviegoer, getting a cinema membership card and enjoying member benefits can save you quite a bit of money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>An Analysis of Political Elements in 2025 Spring Festival Films</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-new-year-films-2025/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:49:42 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-new-year-films-2025/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I went to enjoy the atmosphere during the Spring Festival season, and this time I watched two movies, feeling it was somewhat different&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the new developments in the 2025 Spring Festival movie season, focusing on &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Guardian of the Galaxy: The Magic Child.&amp;rdquo; The former uses the backdrop of San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown in 1900 to depict the discrimination and oppression faced by Chinese people, reflecting the social and political environment. The latter, as an animated film, employs rich metaphorical elements to satirize the current international political landscape, such as the Yuxu Palace resembling the Pentagon, alluding to the American political system; dollar signs on the Tianyuan Ding symbolizing US dollar hegemony; the Immortal Jade Tablet akin to a green card suggesting hierarchical status; and the Soul-Destroying Pill similar to biological weapons hinting at malicious actions. Both films bring a new viewing experience and prompt reflection on the relationship between film art and political expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovation-in-the-style-of-spring-festival-season-films&#34;&gt;Innovation in the style of Spring Festival season films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, films released during the Spring Festival season have been lighthearted and family-friendly, aiming to help audiences relax and unwind during the holiday. However, the 2025 Spring Festival season broke with convention as &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha: Ayakoya&amp;rdquo; incorporated rich political elements, sparking widespread discussion among viewers and ushering in a new era for Spring Festival films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-vivid-reflection-of-the-eras-politics&#34;&gt;A Vivid Reflection of the Era&amp;rsquo;s Politics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;《Mystery of Tangram》is set in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown in 1900, a time when Chinese people overseas faced severe racial discrimination and oppression. As the protagonists investigate the case, they must not only solve the mystery but also confront discrimination and unfair treatment from all sides of society. The film’s portrayal of racial discrimination and power struggles realistically reflects the social and political environment of the time, allowing us to see the arduous struggle that Chinese immigrants made for survival and dignity during that turbulent era. The underlying political issues are worthy of in-depth reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such historical background inevitably brings to mind the current difficulties faced by overseas Chinese in the business sector, such as the TikTok and Zhou Shuzhong incident&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 6, 2024, local time, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected TikTok’s request and upheld the constitutionality of a law mandating its sale on national security grounds. In a memo to employees, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew wrote that the next step will be “to seek an injunction and await review by the U.S. Supreme Court.” The event originated from the passage of the &amp;ldquo;Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act&amp;rdquo; in the United States, which stipulates that ByteDance must divest its U.S. TikTok business within 270 days of the bill&amp;rsquo;s passage, with a final deadline for the forced sale of January 19, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Shou Zi Chew also faced numerous challenges at various hearings. On January 31, 2024, local time, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on &amp;ldquo;Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis.&amp;rdquo; Prominent anti-China lawmaker Tom Cotton questioned Shou Zi Chew with a series of 8 questions about nationality, including asking his country of origin, whether he had applied for Chinese or American citizenship, and even questioning the nationalities of his wife and children. Although the hearing&amp;rsquo;s theme was &amp;ldquo;online child sexual exploitation,&amp;rdquo; the senator shifted the topic to TikTok being owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, forcing Shou Zi Chew to answer questions unrelated to the subject matter. Just like the discrimination faced by Chinese people overseas in &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900,&amp;rdquo; Shou Zi Chew is experiencing unfair treatment and questioning due to TikTok&amp;rsquo;s background in the business realm. This series of events reflects that overseas Chinese have always faced numerous obstacles from external forces when pursuing their own development and protecting their rights, whether it was racial discrimination a century ago or today’s political manipulation in commerce—all of which deserve our deep reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-analysis-of-the-political-metaphor-behind-ne-zha-the-demon-child&#34;&gt;An Analysis of the Political Metaphor Behind &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha: The Demon Child&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ne Zha&amp;rsquo;s Revenge, while appearing to be an ordinary animated film, is filled with political metaphors in its various settings and plot points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping of the Power System&lt;/strong&gt;: The Biying Palace is portrayed as the supreme power center of the realm of immortals, with an architectural style similar to the Pentagon in the United States. Its interior is predominantly white, symbolizing Western hegemonic powers pushing their agenda under the guise of &amp;ldquo;universal values.&amp;rdquo; The “Demon Extermination Squad” led by Wuliang Immortal, and its subordinates, Lunu and He Nü, are believed to correspond to the US alliance system, specifically Japan and South Korea. The “online meeting” scene in Biying Palace, where the Twelve Golden Immortals sit and discuss the &amp;ldquo;War of the Conferred Gods,&amp;rdquo; is likened to NATO meetings led by the United States, which suppress other countries under the banner of &amp;ldquo;maintaining order.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The suggestion of economic hegemony: The Tianyuan Cauldron, used for alchemy in Yuxu Palace, has a dollar sign at the entrance, metaphorically representing how the United States &amp;ldquo;alchemizes&amp;rdquo; resources from other countries through economic hegemony. In the film, Wuliang Xianweng throws the dragon clan into the cauldron to be refined under the guise of “acting on behalf of heaven,” similar to how certain countries seek benefits by exploiting &amp;ldquo;international rules.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metaphor of identity and hierarchy: The jade pendant representing the divine status that Nezha receives is highly similar to a US green card in color and design, symbolizing the exclusion and hierarchical division of immortals towards &amp;ldquo;outsiders,&amp;rdquo; hinting at the differences in identity and unequal treatment between different countries and groups in reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The allusion to malicious acts: The Oblivion Pill forced on Nezha by the Immortal Wonderman, resembling a bioweapon, subtly mocks certain countries that, under the guise of &amp;ldquo;saving the world,&amp;rdquo; engage in destruction and ruin of other nations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbol of Resources and Development&lt;/strong&gt;: As a key element in reshaping the bodies of Nezha and Ao Bing, Qise Baolian (Seven-Colored Lotus) symbolizes the energy and technological lifelines monopolized by powerful nations. The acquisition of its “essence and elixir” requires passing the “immortality examination” of Yuxu Palace, reflecting the dependence of developing countries on core resources and the &amp;ldquo;rule-based predation&amp;rdquo; they face under a hegemonic system. The lotus’s temporary failure and recovery conditions allude to the survival challenges faced by small nations amidst energy crises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-deep-reflection-on-film-art-and-political-expression&#34;&gt;A deep reflection on film art and political expression
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two films incorporated political elements into the nationwide movie-going frenzy during the Spring Festival season, bringing audiences a new viewing experience. They are no longer just purely entertaining works but more like mirrors reflecting political issues in history and reality. This has sparked deep reflection on the relationship between cinematic art and political expression. Will directors increasingly convey their views on society and politics through film in future creations? Can cinema, as a powerful cultural medium, take on greater attention to and contemplation of social realities while maintaining artistic expression? These questions are worth exploring when appreciating films, and we also look forward to the film industry bringing more exciting integration of art and reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-egg&#34;&gt;Easter egg
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Doutao large language model isn&amp;rsquo;t very reliable today; it froze several times, and the article got stuck halfway through without allowing me to continue. I had to start a new session.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The two major political parties in the United States—the Democratic Party and the Republican Party</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:40:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Democratic and Republican parties have significant differences in their political ideologies, policy proposals, and social values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;political-ideology-and-policy-propositions&#34;&gt;Political ideology and policy propositions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Party: leans liberal, advocates for an active role of government in economic and social affairs, supports social welfare, environmental protection, and multiculturalism. On tax policy, the Democratic Party supports tax cuts for middle- and low-income groups while raising taxes on high earners and corporations. On social issues, the Democratic Party supports abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and advocates for strict gun control. In foreign policy, the Democratic Party emphasizes multilateralism and diplomatic means, tending to resolve global issues through international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Republican Party: leans conservative, advocates for limited government intervention, and emphasizes individual freedom and market economy. On tax policy, the Republican Party supports tax cuts, believing that they should apply to everyone regardless of income level. On social issues, the Republican Party opposes abortion and same-sex marriage, and supports the right to bear arms. In foreign policy, the Republican Party tends to take a hard line and supports using military means to protect national interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-significance-of-trump-coming-to-power&#34;&gt;The significance of Trump coming to power
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s re-election as US President in 2024 marks the Republican Party’s dominance in American politics. Trump’s policy stances include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic policy: Trump advocates for stimulating economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation, particularly supporting the development of traditional manufacturing and energy industries. He also tends to adopt protectionist trade policies, renegotiating or withdrawing from existing trade agreements to protect American economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immigration policy: Trump plans to strengthen border security, restrict illegal immigration, and impose stricter scrutiny and restrictions on legal immigrants. He also supports limiting refugee and asylum applications in order to protect national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign policy: Trump tends to adopt unilateralism, emphasizing &amp;ldquo;America First,&amp;rdquo; reducing reliance on international organizations, reassessing relations with allies, and taking tougher diplomatic measures when necessary. He also plans to expand the production and use of fossil fuels and relax restrictions on environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second term for Trump could lead to significant adjustments in US domestic policy and have a profound impact on global politics and economics. His policies are likely to draw attention and reactions from the international community, particularly in areas such as trade, environment, and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Deploy DeepSeek-R1 locally</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ollama-local-deployment-deepseek-r1/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:41:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ollama-local-deployment-deepseek-r1/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ollama is an open-source AI tool designed to enable users to run and deploy large language models (LLMs) locally. Its goal is to provide a convenient and efficient way for developers to use models like GPT on their local machines without relying on cloud services. Ollama supports various models and focuses on optimizing performance, ensuring that even resource-constrained devices can run these models smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Ollama, users can use text-based AI applications and interact with locally deployed models without worrying about data privacy or high API usage fees. You can call different models through the command-line interface (CLI) to perform tasks such as natural language processing and question answering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ollama is suitable for trying out different models. The Windows version, after testing, doesn&amp;rsquo;t fully utilize the hardware&amp;rsquo;s performance; this may be due to the Windows version itself. The Linux version might be better. When deploying a 32b parameter model, with low memory and GPU load, the response speed is very slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hardware-overview&#34;&gt;Hardware Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating system: win11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU：i7-10700K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory: 40GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics card: RTX 3060 12GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;environmental-preparation&#34;&gt;Environmental preparation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a new system environment variable for convenient use later&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_MODELS=E:\ollama&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This variable specifies the storage path for the Ollama model. &lt;code&gt;E:\ollama&lt;/code&gt; is a folder path indicating that all local model files are stored in this directory. Ollama will load and use your downloaded or deployed language models based on this path. You can store the model files in other locations, just change this path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:8000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This environment variable sets the host and port for the Ollama service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; is the local address (localhost), meaning that the Ollama service will only listen for requests from the local machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The port number 8000 is the designated port, indicating that the Ollama service will listen for and process requests on port 8000. You can change the port number as needed, but make sure it is not occupied by other applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This environment variable controls which sources of requests are allowed to access the Ollama service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; indicates that any source (i.e., all domains and IP addresses) is allowed to access the Ollama service. This is typically used in development and debugging environments; in production, you would usually specify stricter source control, limiting access only to specific domains or IPs to improve security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deepseek-r1-model-deployment&#34;&gt;DeepSeek-R1 Model Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ollama installation is straightforward and will not be elaborated on here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-installation verification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;C:\Users\core&amp;gt;ollama -v
ollama version is 0.5.11
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model deployment, refer to the official website model page and select the corresponding parameters for the model: &lt;code&gt;ollama run deepseek-r1:14b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 14B parameter model can effectively remember conversation context, while smaller parameter versions cannot. The 32B parameter version is very slow when deployed locally, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t conduct further testing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PowerShell 7 and Persistent Settings Command-Line Prediction View</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/powershell-7-persisting-settings-command-line-prediction-view/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:19:12 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/powershell-7-persisting-settings-command-line-prediction-view/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m used to zsh on Linux, and when writing a blog post the other day, I suddenly discovered that PowerShell 7 also supports persistent settings for command-line prediction views. So I tried it out, and found it quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what operation was performed, but this feature is enabled – it just appeared&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s diverse operating system environment, system administrators and developers have been seeking a tool that is cross-platform, efficient, and powerful to meet their needs in system management and automation tasks. PowerShell 7 is precisely such a highly anticipated tool; it not only provides robust scripting capabilities but also enables operation across Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems, bringing users unprecedented convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;powershell-7-a-powerful-cross-platform-tool&#34;&gt;PowerShell 7: A Powerful Cross-Platform Tool
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;cross-platform-features&#34;&gt;Cross-platform features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 breaks platform limitations, allowing users to utilize a single PowerShell 7 tool whether managing enterprise-level servers on Windows systems, performing system maintenance in Linux environments, or tackling everyday development tasks on macOS. This significantly improves work efficiency and reduces the learning curve and operational complexity caused by platform differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;powerful-features&#34;&gt;Powerful features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It possesses powerful scripting capabilities, supporting object-oriented programming, functions, modules, and other advanced programming features. Through PowerShell 7, users can easily operate the file system, creating, deleting, copying, and moving files and folders; access and modify the registry to make in-depth adjustments to the system configuration; and manage processes and services to effectively monitor and control the system&amp;rsquo;s running state. In addition, PowerShell 7 can also interact with various Windows and non-Windows technologies, such as user and permission management in Active Directory, resource allocation and management on the Azure cloud platform, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-source-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Open-source ecosystem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 is open-source, a feature that allows developers and enthusiasts worldwide to actively participate in its development and improvement. A large number of open-source modules and tools are constantly emerging, enriching the functionality and application scenarios of PowerShell 7. Users can find suitable modules within the open-source community to extend PowerShell 7&amp;rsquo;s capabilities based on their needs, or contribute their own code to promote the development of the entire community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compatibility-and-stability&#34;&gt;Compatibility and Stability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 introduces many new features and improvements while maintaining compatibility with older versions of PowerShell. These enhancements not only improve performance but also enhance stability, allowing users to complete various tasks more smoothly and reducing work interruptions caused by software failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-command-line-prediction-view&#34;&gt;Open command-line prediction view
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the many useful features of PowerShell 7, the &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt; command is a practical tool that can enhance the user&amp;rsquo;s command-line input experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without enabling commands, inline auto-completion is still possible. However, this only provides completion within the current line. When enabled, it offers predictive suggestions displayed as a list of all potential options. Users can select the desired option using up and down arrow keys, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of command input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/powershell-7-persisting-settings-command-line-prediction-view/20250207222546.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-make-commands-persistent&#34;&gt;How to make commands persistent
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt; command takes effect every time PowerShell starts, we can add it to PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s profile. A PowerShell profile is a special script that automatically executes its commands when PowerShell starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;confirm-configuration-file-path&#34;&gt;Confirm configuration file path
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In PowerShell, we can use the &lt;code&gt;$PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; variable to view the configuration file path. If the file does not exist at that path, users can manually create one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;echo $PROFILE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-the-configuration-file&#34;&gt;Open the configuration file
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open the file corresponding to the configuration file path obtained through the &lt;code&gt;$PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; variable using a text editor, such as the powerful Notepad++ or the lightweight Visual Studio Code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-command&#34;&gt;Add command
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the open configuration file, add the command &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt;. Ensure the command is written accurately to guarantee that the configuration takes effect correctly when executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;save-configuration-file&#34;&gt;Save configuration file
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing the command addition, save the configuration file and close the text editor. At this point, the configuration file already contains the commands we want to execute each time PowerShell starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;verification-settings&#34;&gt;Verification Settings
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the current PowerShell window and restart PowerShell. In the newly started PowerShell, when entering commands, the command-line input prediction view style should be displayed in list view, indicating that our settings have taken effect successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the above steps, we not only gained a deeper understanding of the powerful features and capabilities of PowerShell 7, but also learned how to enhance the user experience by setting command-line input prediction views, and how to make these settings persistent. We hope this knowledge will help you become more proficient in using PowerShell 7 and efficiently complete various system management and automation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DeepSeek suddenly surged before the Spring Festival, Nvidia stock plummeted: institutional operations and large model thinking chains</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-drop-institutional-operations-large-language-model-chain/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:36:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-drop-institutional-operations-large-language-model-chain/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the Spring Festival, DeepSeek briefly became a hot topic, garnering widespread attention on social media in just a few days. This sudden surge in popularity was not only surprising but also triggered a chain reaction in the market. At the same time, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock experienced a sharp decline, raising concerns about its prospects among many investors. Some institutions conducted large-scale short selling during this period, suggesting everything pointed towards a &amp;ldquo;well-planned&amp;rdquo; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deepseeks-rapid-rise-to-prominence-quickly-becoming-the-focus-of-attention&#34;&gt;DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s rapid rise to prominence: quickly becoming the focus of attention
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is an AI-based tool focused on optimizing deep learning models, particularly in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and image generation. In the days leading up to the Spring Festival, this project suddenly garnered significant attention from a large number of investors and technical professionals. The performance of its team and the technological achievements demonstrated have sparked strong interest among many people. Discussions about DeepSeek dominate all topics in the tech circle, whether on developer communities or social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s sudden surge in popularity is not accidental. After analysis, many people suspect that some institutions may be involved behind the scenes. Especially after its rise, Nvidia’s stock price experienced a noticeable decline, and there are clearly factors driving this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nvidia-stock-plummets-the-force-behind-the-short-selling-operation&#34;&gt;Nvidia stock plummets: The force behind the short-selling operation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), has long been a key hardware provider for many large language models and AI computing. With the rapid development of the AI market, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock has consistently performed strongly and even become a favored investment target for many investors. However, with the rise of DeepSeek and the market’s high attention to its technology, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock experienced a sharp decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind this phenomenon, there may be involved the short-selling strategies of institutional investors. In recent years, with the popularization of AI technology, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock price has been highly driven up, and many investors began to believe that its stock price was overhyped. Especially after DeepSeek’s explosive success, some institutions may have gained substantial profits by shorting Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock. By seizing precise market timing and predicting the influence of DeepSeek, these institutions successfully profited from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;exploring-large-model-thinking-chains-from-results-to-process&#34;&gt;Exploring Large Model Thinking Chains: From &amp;ldquo;Results&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Process&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In traditional AI applications, many practitioners and investors focus more on the &amp;ldquo;results&amp;rdquo; of AI models—such as generated images, text, and other direct outputs. However, in discussions related to DeepSeek, an increasing number of people are realizing that the thinking chain hidden behind large models is the core content that deserves more attention. In the past, we could only see the results of model output, but now, we need to understand the underlying logic, algorithms, and how to optimize model performance by adjusting these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in thinking is, in essence, a deep reflection on AI research and application. Moving from simple black-box operations to truly understanding the internal workings of models has led many technical personnel and investors to begin reassessing the future direction of artificial intelligence. DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s popularity exemplifies this breakthrough application, prompting people to focus on the entire model construction and optimization process, rather than just the final output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s sudden surge in popularity, Nvidia’s stock plunge, and the short-selling operations of institutions behind the market – all this seems to be part of a carefully designed scheme. Through an in-depth understanding of large language model thinking chains, we can see that the application of AI technology is not merely a superficial accumulation of features but rather a deep exploration and optimization of the model&amp;rsquo;s internal logic. As technology advances, we may witness more innovative tools like DeepSeek, driving AI research and applications to higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon not only shows us the immense potential of AI technology but also prompts us to begin thinking about the commercial competition and capital operations behind the technology. The future trend of the market will be a continued focus of the interplay between technology and capital.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Is modern monetary theory the future of global economies?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/modern-monetary-theory-future-global-economy/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 23:16:34 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/modern-monetary-theory-future-global-economy/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The continued bull market in US stocks, aside from America&amp;rsquo;s own &amp;ldquo;hard power,&amp;rdquo; is largely due to the excessive liquidity of the dollar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern monetary system, following the &lt;strong&gt;2008 financial crisis&lt;/strong&gt;, has gradually become a key theoretical underpinning that multiple economies tacitly refer to. Its main feature is an increased emphasis on the initiative of government intervention in the market, utilizing government fiscal deficits as its primary tool to achieve full employment while stabilizing inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are familiar with &lt;strong&gt;Keynesianism&lt;/strong&gt;, which emphasizes the government&amp;rsquo;s role in &lt;strong&gt;smoothing economic cycles&lt;/strong&gt; – suppressing during overheating and stimulating during contractions. It places great importance on the multiplier effect of government spending, that is, how much consumption can be stimulated by a given amount of money. Government spending of 1 unit of currency leads to an increase of 1 unit of income for businesses and individuals, which expands production, increases employment, and boosts consumption, thereby mitigating economic contraction. It also tends to be relatively conservative regarding fiscal deficit limits and sustainability. The &lt;strong&gt;multiplier effect&lt;/strong&gt; can drive market recovery and thus increase government revenue, especially in suppressing overheating cycles, allowing the accumulation of stimulus resources for the next cycle, such as government debt potential and interest rate levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern monetary system is more like an extension of extreme Keynesianism, but with a key difference: the limitation on government debt. Central banks should not be independent and their primary goals are &lt;strong&gt;inflation and full employment&lt;/strong&gt;, specifically inflation related to limited resources and productivity. The idea is that the government, through unlimited fiscal deficits, increases purchasing power in the market as technological advancements improve production efficiency, until it reaches an ideal state of full employment and a production bottleneck. Further increases in money supply will then lead to inflation, at which point controlling the upper limit of the fiscal deficit becomes necessary. As long as there are idle productive resources in the market, increasing the deficit will not cause inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-financial-crisis&#34;&gt;After the financial crisis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, reality is not an ideal world. The execution of each link involves human participation, and Keynesianism is selectively applied, leading to a situation where economic downturns are stimulated more than overheating is suppressed. Stimulus for a poor economy brings political achievements, and even overheating can be seen as such, making it fundamentally difficult to curb. This results in numerous economic problems, new financial crises that may not be inferior to the economic impact caused by traditional overcapacity. The 2008 global financial crisis was actually a bubble resulting from market self-reinforcement under extreme Keynesianism. It produced a large number of Ponzi scheme financial investment products, such as real estate and financial investment products derived from real estate as underlying assets. Even before the crisis erupted, there was insufficient risk awareness at academic, political, and market levels. They considered prosperity supported by debt to be achievements, and many benefited from it – for example, the massive financial system, where losses were borne by participants while dividends were enjoyed. It was a case of profiting handsomely even in bankruptcy; the money is impossible to return, ultimately leading to numerous participants bearing the gains from each link of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the shadow of the modern monetary system emerges after the financial crisis, characterized by rapid &lt;strong&gt;fiscal deficit monetization and unlimited quantitative easing by the central bank&lt;/strong&gt;, along with so-called emergency lending policies. The central bank acts as a lender of last resort, providing an endless supply of liquidity, while governments can continue to accumulate debt. With coordinated cooperation between the central bank and fiscal policy, the central bank supports government fiscal deficits through measures such as purchasing government bonds, ensuring consistency in policy objectives. This is why the boundaries between modern monetary policy and fiscal policy are becoming increasingly blurred, with money base issuance heavily reliant on the central bank&amp;rsquo;s direct participation in buying government debt – printing money with one hand and spending it with the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eurozone and the United States show similar trends. In 2008, EU government debt was approximately €6.7 trillion, with a leverage ratio of around 66%, slightly above the generally accepted warning line of 60%. By 2014, during the 5-year period of rescue measures, the debt scale reached €9.5 trillion and the leverage rose to 93%. The United States is even more exaggerated; in 2008, US government debt was approximately $10 trillion, reaching around $18 trillion by 2014, and recently again raised the government debt ceiling. Of course, each drama uses the threat of a government shutdown as leverage, but each time it breaks the government debt limit, now exceeding $36 trillion – a growth of $26 trillion compared to 2008. Considering GDP growth factors, the government leverage has also increased from 60% to over 120%. The Federal Reserve, as lender of last resort, plays an important role in multiple rescue operations and is one of the main purchasers of government debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-drawbacks-and-limitations-of-the-modern-monetary-system&#34;&gt;The drawbacks and limitations of the modern monetary system
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This government-led economic stimulus plan, although not a planned economy, faces consistent problems. How can you guarantee the omniscience of the market and the selfless courage of all participants in every link? Take a simple example: suppose a government department increases the budget for a certain direction by 1 million – does it go to the leader’s nephew or to the more cost-effective market bidding process? Of course, in reality, interests will be transferred in more complex ways, resulting in the situation where the government expands its debt and expenditure, but the flow is completely uncontrollable. The recent uproar over establishing a government efficiency department in the United States is actually an extension of this kind of problem. Naturally, these vary across different economies with corruption indices, and we are discussing the common issues more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;inflation-issues&#34;&gt;Inflation issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the development of modern information networks, governments now have a far greater grasp on market information than in the past. However, this is not omniscience; the market itself contains variables, and it always changes due to expectations, entering a self-reinforcing loop. I anticipated your anticipation. Consider actual performance as an example: although Modern Monetary Theory performed well between 2008 and 2020, genuinely achieving short-term economic recovery and inflation stability—even leading to temporary deflation in the Eurozone and keeping US inflation largely within the expected range of 1–3%—it led people to believe in a more extreme tool as they once believed in Keynesianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, the main reason is that manufacturing in developing countries continued to show a high growth trend after 2008. For example, China, which gradually secured its position as a global production powerhouse during this period, along with emerging economies like Southeast Asia and India, maintained relatively high manufacturing value-added, effectively offsetting the biggest limitation of Modern Monetary Theory – resource constraints. This allowed Europe and America to maintain relatively stable inflation even amidst deindustrialization, over-financialization, and surging government debt and money supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after 2020, with the use of larger-scale stimulus policies, both the Eurozone and the United States experienced significant inflation, reaching around 10% at their peaks. Even today, nearly three years after interest rate hikes began, the US job market continues to show unusual overheating, and financial markets have seen excessive prosperity diverging from economic growth due to monetary support. As the base effect fades, US inflation is heading towards 3% again. This overheating during interest rate hikes is closely related to fiscal deficits. Interest rate hikes are a contractionary measure in monetary policy, while fiscal policy has been expansionary. Combined with the massive money supply of 2020, this has made US inflation unusually persistent. A major limitation of Modern Monetary Theory is high inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;government-debt-issues&#34;&gt;Government debt issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In principle, the government can indefinitely finance debt repayment through borrowing to repay debt, but the prerequisite is that the central bank must completely become a puppet – that is, &lt;strong&gt;fiscal and monetary policy alignment&lt;/strong&gt; in modern monetary systems. It&amp;rsquo;s clear that the Federal Reserve isn’t prepared to fully relinquish authority to the government. Considering the accumulated government debt balance over decades, especially interest expenses, high-interest debt on top of existing debt has gradually become a massive fiscal burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal year 2023: The U.S. federal government’s fiscal revenue for fiscal year 2023 was $4.439 trillion, with interest payments on debt accounting for approximately 15% of that revenue. This high-interest trend continued in 2024, according to data released by the U.S. Treasury Department.
For fiscal year 2024: the U.S. federal government&amp;rsquo;s budget deficit reached $1.833 trillion, with net interest payments on debt totaling $882 billion, accounting for approximately 18% of U.S. federal revenue—even exceeding Social Security expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the sustainability issue of fiscal policy. If low interest rates and low inflation are maintained for a long time, with high debt (like Japan), it can indeed create an application of quasi-modern monetary theory over the long term. According to the Rule of 72, as long as the interest rate is sufficiently low, incremental borrowing under debt-funded finance is very slow. If the cost of funds is 1%, pure debt-funding can double the debt in 72 years. Assuming inflation disrupts this delicate balance, the accumulation of interest payments on the debt could lead to an uncontrolled trajectory of future debt; compound interest becomes a more significant factor than the principal itself. These issues will become even more acute if the central bank’s actions are inconsistent with the goals of the ruling party. The political agenda of the Trump administration, for example, sharply contrasts with the current hawkish stance of the Federal Reserve, which is an important source of the escalation in relations between the US government and the Fed during this term. What everyone is most concerned about is whether the current chairman can successfully reach the end of his term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;financial-bubbles-and-monetary-credit-issues&#34;&gt;Financial bubbles and monetary credit issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, government spending increases would flow to households and businesses, prompting them to increase their own spending and boosting effective demand. However, having firsthand experience of numerous financial bubbles since 2000, people will clearly show a strong preference for investment over consumption, especially when products with extremely high expectations of appreciation emerge. People rush to the financial markets seeking higher returns, even at the expense of quality of life and taking on leverage. This is similar behavior observed during periods of rapid growth in real estate in Japan, the United States, and our country. Combined with policy stimulus and practitioners pursuing their own interests, there are many issues like subprime loans. Many so-called market-saving policies actually encourage borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History consistently shows a striking pattern: when monetary and fiscal policies are aggressively implemented, they often lead to &lt;strong&gt;a boom in asset bubbles and wealth redistribution&lt;/strong&gt;. Asset bubbles come first, followed by wealth redistribution, which then leads to another problem – the economic Ponzi scheme that arises from extreme Keynesianism or prolonged use of Modern Monetary Theory (Minsky moment). As long as there is hot money, asset prices continue to rise, and as long as they continue to rise, it attracts newcomers with cash. Meanwhile, the CPI measuring changes in basic living expenses remains relatively unchanged; money stagnates in specific sectors. Newcomers eventually run out of funds, and &lt;strong&gt;after the revelry comes the crash&lt;/strong&gt; – the Minsky moment’s judgment – a pattern that has never failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, currency itself is subject to supply and demand. When the market supply is excessive, traditional investment assets cannot absorb it, or when it fails to attract capital after repeated cycles—such as real estate bubbles that have collapsed repeatedly (something Japanese people haven&amp;rsquo;t dared to touch in decades)—and policies like taxation suppress speculation, increasing taxes on property ownership to reduce speculative demand will all increase the cost of financial speculation. In a situation where currency supply is excessive, the market urgently needs investment assets that are both capital-attracting and tax-free. Various virtual investment products emerge as a result. Even the U.S. President and First Lady have come in for a share. One explanation is poaching from the dollar&amp;rsquo;s domain, but it’s more accurately seen as an inevitable consequence of global currency overissuance and financial churning leading to erosion of fiat currency credit. The credibility of modern monetary theory, which relies heavily on the state&amp;rsquo;s monopoly rights over credit-based currency, may even be challenged. What kind of environment gives rise to what kind of financial games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Modern Monetary Theory and Keynesianism are more like a progressive and substitutional relationship. It places greater emphasis on government intervention in the market and adopts a more radical attitude towards fiscal deficits and central bank independence. The overuse of Keynesianism led to stagflation and financial crises. In response to this artificially overheated economy&amp;rsquo;s clearing, Modern Monetary Theory quietly took over after 2008. Amidst continued productivity gains in economic globalization, it quickly restored growth and maintained inflation levels in the countries using it in the short term, but also accumulated large government debt and financial bubbles. When inflation rebounded, and the central bank’s goals diverged from the government&amp;rsquo;s, high interest rates and high leverage exacerbated the fiscal burden caused by government debt repayment, significantly weakening fiscal sustainability. At the same time, excessive government involvement in base money issuance led to financial bubbles, while unlimited printing weakened the currency&amp;rsquo;s creditworthiness itself. The strength of the dollar appears impressive, but it is actually supported by the weakness of others. A huge demand for investment has spawned various new financial investment and speculative tools, even escaping the tax restrictions on traditional financial investment products. This is a microcosm of the global economy. Modern Monetary Theory may not be the future; rather, it&amp;rsquo;s a relic of the past, starting in 2008. Coupled with reverse globalization, the greater the financial bubbles blown, the higher the accumulation of government debt, and the more reckless the financial speculation, the higher the efficiency of distorted wealth distribution, and the greater the risk of a hard landing – including economic and social risks. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s Keynesianism or Modern Monetary Theory, no matter how much money is supplied, it cannot truly solve the problem of wealth structure; instead, it exacerbates risks in asset bubbles and moral hazard. People repeatedly fall into the same pit in different poses but never learn from their mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A Complete Guide to Monitoring Linux System Metrics with the atop Tool: Installation, Configuration, and Usage</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/using-atop-to-monitor-linux-system-metrics-installation-configuration-and-usage-guide/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 22:48:55 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/using-atop-to-monitor-linux-system-metrics-installation-configuration-and-usage-guide/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Real-time and comprehensive monitoring of system resources and process status is crucial in Linux system maintenance. As a powerful monitoring tool, atop can help us easily achieve this goal. This article will detail how to install, configure, and use the atop monitoring tool on a Linux instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-atop-tool&#34;&gt;Introduction to atop tool
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atop is a tool specifically designed for monitoring Linux system resources and processes. It records system and process activity, reporting the status of all running processes. The data collected covers resource usage such as CPU, memory, disk, and network, as well as process states. This data can also be saved to disk in log file format. For each process, we can obtain key information such as CPU utilization, memory growth, disk usage, priority, username, status, and exit code. Furthermore, through the atop configuration file, we can customize parameters such as logging frequency, log file storage path, and rotation policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-installing-the-atop-tool&#34;&gt;II. Installing the atop tool
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The installation methods of atop vary slightly across different Linux distributions; the following introduces it using a common operating system as an example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba Cloud Linux 3/2、CentOS 7/8、Fedora、Rocky Linux 9&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute installation command: &lt;code&gt;sudo yum install -y atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the atop service: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu / Debian&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update software sources: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the installation command: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install -y atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start atop service: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CentOS Stream 9&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install: &lt;code&gt;sudo wget https://www.atoptool.nl/download/atop-2.11.0-1.el9.x86_64.rpm &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo rpm -i atop-2.11.0-1.el9.x86_64.rpm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start atop service: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;openSUSE&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute installation command: &lt;code&gt;sudo zypper install -y atop atop-daemon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the atop service: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the operating systems listed above do not include your distribution, you can visit the atop official website for installation information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-configuring-monitoring-cycle-and-log-retention-time&#34;&gt;III. Configuring Monitoring Cycle and Log Retention Time
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration file location: On Alibaba Cloud Linux 3/2, CentOS 7/8, and Fedora systems, the atop configuration file is /etc/sysconfig/atop; on Ubuntu, Debian, and openSUSE systems, the configuration file is /etc/default/atop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default Configuration Parameters Description
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LOGOPTS: Used to control log file recording options, defaults to empty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The monitoring cycle, default is 600 seconds. If you need to collect historical logs to track issues, adjust this frequency according to your actual needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LOGGENERATIONS: Log retention time, default 28 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LOGPATH: The path where log files are stored, default /var/log/atop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration Steps
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the command to open the configuration file:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Alibaba Cloud Linux 3/2, CentOS 7/8, Fedora systems: &lt;code&gt;sudo vim /etc/sysconfig/atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, CentOS Stream 9, Rocky Linux 9 systems: &lt;code&gt;sudo vim /etc/default/atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; to enter edit mode and adjust configuration parameters as needed. For example, change the monitoring cycle to 30 seconds, set the log retention time to 7 days, and keep the log path at its default setting:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the &lt;code&gt;Esc&lt;/code&gt; key, enter &lt;code&gt;:wq&lt;/code&gt;, save and exit editing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restarting the atop service will apply the configuration: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl restart atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;LOGOPTS=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
LOGINTERVAL=30
LOGGENERATIONS=7
LOGPATH=/var/log/atop 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-using-the-atop-tool&#34;&gt;Four, Using the atop tool
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction to Common Commands: In interactive command mode, the following are common commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch back to the default composite output view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Displays the full command line of processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort by process memory usage in descending order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort by process disk usage in descending order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort in descending order based on the comprehensive utilization rate of processes and resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort by process network usage in descending order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the next monitoring point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the previous monitoring point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b: Specifies a point in time, formatted as &lt;code&gt;YYYYMMDDhhmm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction to Resource Monitoring Fields&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host name, information sampling date and time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall process runtime status, including kernel and user space running time, total number of processes, and the number of processes in different states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CPU utilization shows the overall usage, with each field&amp;rsquo;s numerical sum resulting in &lt;code&gt;N*100%&lt;/code&gt; (where N is the number of CPU cores), including kernel time, user time, interrupt time, idle time, and wait for disk I/O time proportions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPL: CPU load information, such as the average number of processes in the run queue over the past 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes, context switch count, and interrupt occurrence count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MEM: Memory usage, including total physical memory, idle memory, page cache memory, file cache memory, and kernel occupied memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SWP: Swap space usage, including total swap area and free swap space size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAG&lt;/strong&gt;: Virtual memory paging status, such as the number of pages swapped in and out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSK: Disk Usage, each disk device corresponds to a row, displaying device identifier, busy time ratio, and read/write request count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NET: Network conditions, displaying receive and send packet sizes for the transport layer TCP and UDP, IP layer, and active network interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View real-time system metrics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check system metrics every 5 seconds: &lt;code&gt;atop 5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check system metrics within the next 5 minutes (total of 30 times, with a 10-second interval): &lt;code&gt;atop -M 10 30&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check system metrics after 10 minutes (10 times, with a 60-second interval) and write the results to a file: &lt;code&gt;atop -M 60 10 &amp;gt; /log/atop.mem&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view historical indicator logs: After atop starts, the collection records are stored by default in the &lt;code&gt;/var/log/atop&lt;/code&gt; directory. When viewing, be sure to check that the log file for the specified date exists; otherwise, an error will occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View daily history indicators log: &lt;code&gt;atop -r&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View yesterday&amp;rsquo;s historical indicator logs: &lt;code&gt;atop -r y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View historical indicator logs for a specified date, such as November 6, 2024: &lt;code&gt;atop -r 20241106&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View historical indicator logs from a specified time within a specified date, such as starting at 14:00 on November 6, 2024: &lt;code&gt;atop -r 20241106 -b 14:00&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View the historical indicator logs for a specified time period within a specific date, such as November 5, 2024 from 00:04 to 00:08: &lt;code&gt;atop -r 20241105 -b 00:04 -e 00:08&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View System Activity Report&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the CPU utilization report of the current system within 1 minute (12 times, interval 5 seconds): &lt;code&gt;atopsar -c 5 12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To view the memory metrics report for a specified time period on that day, such as from 18:00 to 18:01: &lt;code&gt;atopsar -m -b 18:00 -e 18:01&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View memory metrics reports for a specified date and time period, such as November 5, 2024, from 18:00 to 18:01: &lt;code&gt;atopsar -m -r 20241105 -b 18:00 -e 18:01&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v-other-operations&#34;&gt;V. Other Operations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configure a Tian-level log rotation policy: If you want to generate an atop index log file every day, you can perform the following operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) Adjust the monitoring cycle, log retention time, and log storage path as needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run command to set daily log rotation related services to start on boot and start the services: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl enable --now atop atopacct atop-rotate.timer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the business has more complex requirements for log processing, it can be combined with logrotate or custom scripts to implement log management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load the optional netatop kernel module: If you need to monitor network usage, you can install the netatop module (this module is not installed by default in atop). Taking Alibaba Cloud Linux 3 as an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

        <title>Understanding buy rate and sell rate in exchange rates</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-exchange-rates-buy-and-sell-rates/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 22:32:10 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-exchange-rates-buy-and-sell-rates/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the foreign exchange market, especially at banks or currency exchange points, we often see terms like &amp;ldquo;buy rate&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sell rate.&amp;rdquo; Many people may not be clear about these two concepts, or even confused. Today, let&amp;rsquo;s use a simple example to help everyone understand the meaning and function of these two rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-buy-exchange-rate-and-sell-exchange-rate&#34;&gt;What are &amp;ldquo;buy exchange rate&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sell exchange rate&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buy rate is the exchange rate at which a bank or currency exchange institution is willing to purchase foreign currency; that is, when you sell foreign currency (such as US dollars) to a bank, the bank will pay you in RMB according to the buy rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selling exchange rate is the rate at which a bank or currency exchange institution is willing to sell foreign currency; that is, when you buy foreign currency with Chinese Yuan, the bank will sell it to you at the selling exchange rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The buy exchange rate is the price at which a bank buys foreign currency from you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling exchange rate: The price the bank offers you for foreign currency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that banks&amp;rsquo; buying and selling exchange rates are usually different, with the selling rate generally higher than the buying rate. This difference is the bank’s source of profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-study-analysis&#34;&gt;Case Study Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help everyone better understand the practical application of these two exchange rates, let&amp;rsquo;s take a specific example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you go to the bank to exchange for US dollars, and the exchange rate offered by the bank is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy exchange rate: 1 US dollar = 7.0 Chinese yuan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling exchange rate: 1 US dollar = 7.2 Chinese yuan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-1-you-sell-us-dollars-to-the-bank&#34;&gt;Scenario 1: You sell US dollars to the bank
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have $1,000 and want to sell it to a bank; the bank will calculate based on its buying exchange rate&lt;/p&gt;
\[
$1000 x 7.0 yuan/dollar = 7000 yuan
\]
&lt;p&gt;That means the bank will give you 7,000 RMB. The exchange rate here is a &lt;strong&gt;buy rate&lt;/strong&gt;, because you are selling dollars to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-2-you-buy-us-dollars-with-rmb&#34;&gt;Scenario 2: You buy US dollars with RMB
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have 7,000 RMB and want to exchange it for US dollars. The bank will calculate based on the selling exchange rate:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
$7,000 yuan ÷ 7.2 yuan/dollar = $972.22
\]
&lt;p&gt;In this case, you can exchange 7000 Chinese Yuan for approximately 972.22 US dollars. The exchange rate here is a &lt;strong&gt;selling rate&lt;/strong&gt;, as you are buying US dollars from the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-the-buying-exchange-rate-different-from-the-selling-exchange-rate&#34;&gt;Why is the buying exchange rate different from the selling exchange rate?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that the bank&amp;rsquo;s buying exchange rate (7.0 RMB/USD) is lower than its selling exchange rate (7.2 RMB/USD). This is because banks typically profit from foreign exchange transactions by using this difference in rates. In other words, banks make a profit by charging a higher selling exchange rate and paying a lower buying exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the above case, the bank&amp;rsquo;s spread is:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
Selling exchange rate (7.2) - Buying exchange rate (7.0) = 0.2 RMB
\]
&lt;p&gt;This difference is the bank&amp;rsquo;s source of profit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy exchange rate: The bank buys foreign currency from you at this rate (the rate at which you sell foreign currency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling exchange rate: This is the exchange rate at which the bank sells foreign currency to you (the exchange rate when you buy foreign currency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between the buying and selling exchange rates is the bank&amp;rsquo;s profit margin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understand these exchange rate concepts, you can more clearly know how much foreign currency you will receive when exchanging currencies, or how much Chinese Yuan (RMB) you need to spend to buy foreign currency. I hope this simple example helps everyone better understand the basic principles of foreign exchange rates!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Loading mismatched PDB files in Visual Studio</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-loading-unmatched-pdb-files/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 20:04:33 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-loading-unmatched-pdb-files/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When debugging a program in Visual Studio on Windows, if the PDB file does not match the executable file, Visual Studio will prompt &amp;ldquo;Unable to load symbol file.&amp;rdquo; If the program crashes and a crash dump file is generated, Visual Studio may also fail to smoothly enter the crash site if the PDB file is mismatched&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-pdb-file&#34;&gt;What is a pdb file?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDB files are debugging information files created by Microsoft, used for debugging programs. They contain information such as program symbol tables, source file names, and line numbers. PDB files can be generated during program compilation for debugging purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;debugging-with-windbg&#34;&gt;Debugging with WinDbg
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WinDbg is a debugging tool from Microsoft that can be used to debug Windows programs. WinDbg can load mismatched PDB files, but they need to be loaded manually. The &lt;code&gt;.reload /f /i&lt;/code&gt; command can force the loading of mismatched PDB files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, WinDbg is not as convenient to use as Visual Studio, so we hope that Visual Studio can also load mismatched PDB files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio-loading-mismatched-pdb-file&#34;&gt;Visual Studio loading mismatched PDB file
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source code is generally managed through git now, so it&amp;rsquo;s possible to find the corresponding version of the code, recompile it, and generate the corresponding pdb file. Why can’t it be loaded? It’s mainly due to metadata mismatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a small tool that can modify metadata, generate a new PDB file based on the executable file information, allowing Visual Studio to load it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;chkmatch download address: [https://www.debuginfo.com/tools/chkmatch.html]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site cache address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;chkmatch.zip&#34; &gt;chkmatch.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;ChkMatch utility can be used to check whether an executable and debug information file match. It can also be used to enforce matching between an executable and debug information file, if they are compatible.

For more information about debug information matching and related issues, see this article.

Supported debug information formats: DBG, PDB 2.0, PDB 7.0.

chkmatch [-c ExeFile DebugInfoFile ] |
         [-m ExeFile DebugInfoFile]
-c
Check matching between the executable and the debug information file.
-m
Make the executable and the debug information file match.
ExeFile
The name of the executable file.
DebugInfoFile
The name of the debug information file.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-chkmatch&#34;&gt;Use chkmatch
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, perform a verification check, analyze the reason for the mismatch, and prompt that the signature does not match&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cursor AI programming IDE trial</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cursor-ai-programming-ide-trial/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 19:30:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cursor-ai-programming-ide-trial/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Another year has gone by. The biggest change at work is the noticeably increased involvement of AI. Previously, switching between different development languages required developers to be familiar with various languages&amp;rsquo; distinct APIs. Now, these basic codes can all be generated through AI, which is a great boon for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chatgpt&#34;&gt;ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2023, I revised two simple introductory articles. Now it&amp;rsquo;s 2025, and honestly, I haven’t perceived any significant progress. It still requires developing your own understanding, being able to reasonably break down tasks, and most importantly, identifying whether there are bugs in the AI-generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-copilot&#34;&gt;Github copilot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I forgot what day it is, but I saw in the documentation that Singapore deployed servers. For domestic use, we no longer need to constantly use a VPN. Of course, you still need a VPN to log in, but this VPN only needs to be used once for login and can then be turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Github Copilot more often on a daily basis; this plugin can be used directly in VS Code and Visual Studio, without switching between the two programs. Compared to ChatGPT, Github Copilot offers better project support and a friendlier interaction. You can choose parts of local files to &amp;ldquo;train&amp;rdquo; the AI, so the generated code is more aligned with your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cursor-ai&#34;&gt;Cursor AI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently saw a new AI programming IDE, Cursor AI. This IDE is also based on GitHub Copilot, but this IDE is even more intelligent and can help you create files directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried it briefly, and it feels pretty good, but my understanding of the existing project is still not enough. When there are many local project files, large refactoring and optimization adjustments still require &lt;strong&gt;developers to break down tasks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example: Switch to curso’s engineering mode, enter the following content: Create a personal resume webpage that supports switching between multiple different styles. Remember to fill in some personal information for data display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few back-and-forths, you can obtain the following webpage. Of course, this webpage is still relatively simple, but it&amp;rsquo;s quite good for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, registered users can enjoy 150 free trials of the advanced API, while paying users are limited to 5000 calls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resume&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>C&#43;&#43; Bitwise Operations Basics: Bit Extraction and Flag Setting</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-bitwise-operations-basics-flags/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 02:23:56 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-bitwise-operations-basics-flags/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In practical C++ development, bit operations are a common technique, especially when dealing with system states, flags, or control bits. Bit operations can provide very efficient solutions. This article will explain how to use bit operations to get and set specific flag bits through an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;basic-operating-concepts&#34;&gt;Basic operating concepts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In computers, data is stored in binary digits (bits) of 0 and 1. Bitwise operations are operations performed on these binary digits. C++ has several commonly used bitwise operators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitwise AND (&amp;amp;): Used to check if a bit is 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitwise OR (|): Used to set a bit to 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XOR (exclusive OR) by bit: Used to invert a specific bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitwise NOT (~) : Inverts all bits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift all bits left by several positions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shifts all bits to the right by several positions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we need to perform a series of bit operations on an &lt;code&gt;unsigned short&lt;/code&gt; type variable &lt;code&gt;wInfo&lt;/code&gt;, using different flag bits to represent different states&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mermaid&#34;&gt;flowchart LR
    A[原始数值: 00010000] --&amp;gt; B[左移: 00010000 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1]
    B --&amp;gt; C[结果: 00100000]
    C --&amp;gt; D[右移: 00100000 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1]
    D --&amp;gt; E[结果: 00010000]

    subgraph 左移操作
        direction LR
        A --&amp;gt; B --&amp;gt; C
    end

    subgraph 右移操作
        direction LR
        C --&amp;gt; D --&amp;gt; E
    end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirements-analysis&#34;&gt;Requirements Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the description in the question, we have a 16-bit flag used to represent different states. These states are represented by various binary bits, each corresponding to a specific meaning. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has bit0 failed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is bit1 compressed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is bit2 incremental?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does bit3 have any follow-up packages?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal request or logout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;implement-using-bit-operations&#34;&gt;Implement using bit operations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will use bit operations to set and get these flag bits. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extracting bit values: Obtain the value of a specific bit (0 or 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a bit to 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a bit to 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first define an &lt;code&gt;unsigned short&lt;/code&gt; type variable &lt;code&gt;wInfo&lt;/code&gt; to store these flags. Then, we use bit operations to check and set the corresponding flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;c-example-code&#34;&gt;C++ example code
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;bitset&amp;gt;

// 定义标志位常量
const unsigned short BIT_0_FAIL = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0;    // bit0 是否失败
const unsigned short BIT_1_COMPRESSED = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1; // bit1 是否压缩
const unsigned short BIT_2_INCREMENT = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2;  // bit2 是否增量
const unsigned short BIT_3_HAS_MORE = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 3;   // bit3 是否有后续包
const unsigned short BIT_5_CANCEL = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 5;     // bit5 正常请求(0)或注销(1)

// 检查某一位是否为1
bool isBitSet(unsigned short wInfo, unsigned short bitMask) {
    return (wInfo &amp;amp; bitMask) != 0;
}

// 设置某一位为1
void setBit(unsigned short&amp;amp; wInfo, unsigned short bitMask) {
    wInfo |= bitMask;
}

// 清除某一位（设置为0）
void clearBit(unsigned short&amp;amp; wInfo, unsigned short bitMask) {
    wInfo &amp;amp;= ~bitMask;
}

int main() {
    // 假设wInfo的初始值为0
    unsigned short wInfo = 0;

    // 检查各个标志位
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit0 (是否失败): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_0_FAIL) ? &amp;quot;是&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;否&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flag bits are defined using bit shift operations (&lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; n&lt;/code&gt;). For example, &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to &lt;code&gt;bit0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to &lt;code&gt;bit1&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. This assigns a unique binary position to each flag bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;isBitSet&lt;/code&gt; function checks if a specific flag is set to 1 by performing a bitwise AND operation &lt;code&gt;wInfo &amp;amp; bitMask&lt;/code&gt;. If the bit is 1, the function returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;; otherwise, it returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;setBit&lt;/code&gt; function sets a specific flag to 1 using a bitwise OR operation &lt;code&gt;wInfo |= bitMask&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;clearBit&lt;/code&gt; function sets a specific flag to 0 using a bitwise AND operation: &lt;code&gt;wInfo &amp;amp;= ~bitMask&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through bit manipulation, we can efficiently handle multiple status flag bits. This technique is particularly useful in practical development. For example, it is often used in scenarios such as embedded development, network protocols, and system state management, where bit flags are used to represent multiple binary states, saving space and improving efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this blog helps you understand how to use bitwise operations in C++ to achieve bit extraction and setting. Mastering these skills is very helpful for writing efficient and maintainable code!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Desktop upgrade to 2.5G network card, accelerating local area network interconnection</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/desktop-upgrade-to-25g-network-card-accelerate-lan-interconnection/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:37:52 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/desktop-upgrade-to-25g-network-card-accelerate-lan-interconnection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We previously mentioned the PCIe adapter for solid-state drives, so where did the old SSDs go? They weren&amp;rsquo;t wasted; they were removed and installed in the &lt;code&gt;Mechanical Master Creator Mini-3765H&lt;/code&gt; (purchased a year ago)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new machine still has impressive hardware specs: 2.5G dual network ports, PCIE4.0, and WiFi6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently moved, and the room doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a separate router for networking. The machines are all connected via wireless network. The ASUS motherboard desktop’s wireless card performance isn’t good enough, or it could be due to the router&amp;rsquo;s wireless access; the upload speed between local area networks is poor, which results in slow speeds between the machines. I purchased a 2.5G network card and installed it on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, all of the motherboard&amp;rsquo;s slots are used up: graphics card, wireless network card, 2.5G network card, and a solid-state drive PCIe adapter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;network-instructions&#34;&gt;Network instructions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two machines still use the original wireless network card for internet access, but they are directly connected with a network cable, and both ends have 2.5G network cards. How to connect the two machines with a network cable doesn&amp;rsquo;t need much explanation; there are many tutorials online. Remember to disable the firewall. You can choose either machine as the gateway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Occasional disk recognition issues due to too many disks installed on ASUS Z490 motherboards</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/asus-motherboard-z490-too-many-disks-intermittent-disk-recognition/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:08:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/asus-motherboard-z490-too-many-disks-intermittent-disk-recognition/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from the previous discussion, I encountered a problem where the wireless network card was not being recognized. Before rebuilding the partitions, I also searched online for other solutions, such as removing the motherboard battery and disconnecting power for fifteen minutes; or upgrading to the latest BOIS driver, but all of these had issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking there were still things to deal with, I switched to a limited network and ran the ethernet cable from the living room to the room. At this point, another problem arose – the wired network couldn&amp;rsquo;t be recognized either. I tried a drastic measure of reinstalling the system, which resulted in a missing partition error. If these problems consistently occurred, I wouldn’t have bothered troubleshooting for so long. This ASUS disk conflict is intermittent and triggered by unstable system restarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desktop computer had a new disk added last week, a 2TB solid-state drive from Yangtze Memory (YMTC), M.2 interface. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been restarted since then until yesterday when it was shut down once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disk Family Portrait&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reinstall-system&#34;&gt;Reinstall system
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been two years since I last reinstalled the system. The C drive is full, and Windows has its usual problems – various software likes to save things on the C drive. So, I decided to reinstall the system. After reinstalling the system, the network card issues were resolved normally. The next day, I restored my development environment and prepared to back up the system. That&amp;rsquo;s when a new problem arose: after restarting the system, the boot partition was lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the steps in the previous article, I rebuilt the boot partition, but it&amp;rsquo;s not very stable. After restarting, the boot partition might fail to load at any time. I started suspecting issues with the computer case, when I noticed the hard drive cable was loose, but after checking several times, there’s no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;memory-revival&#34;&gt;Memory revival
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, this machine had an SSD installed once. At that time, I bought a PCIe adapter (plugged into the graphics card slot) instead of installing the drive directly on the motherboard. This time, installing it directly on the motherboard might be due to a problem with the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state transformer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;motherboard-manual&#34;&gt;Motherboard Manual
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motherboard manual has an issue: the location of the SATA ports indicated in the manual doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the actual locations. Because I have too many disks, they are all installed on the interfaces. The older SSDs use SATA interfaces. According to the motherboard manual, there is a conflict between these interfaces. After testing, this conflict is triggered unstably. When it triggers, the corresponding disk cannot be loaded. This happens to be the system disk, and the bootloader is also on that disk, so the system fails to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/asus-motherboard-z490-too-many-disks-intermittent-disk-recognition/20250110002401.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinstalled the solid-state drive onto the PCIe adapter, and at that point, there was no conflict with the SATA interface on the motherboard anymore, so the system started up normally&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Unveiling the Secrets of ESP Partitioning, GPT Partition Tables, and the Windows Operating System&#39;s Collaboration</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/exploring-esp-gpt-and-windows-cooperation/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 23:58:20 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/exploring-esp-gpt-and-windows-cooperation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday after work, I got home and turned on my desktop as usual. The system booted up normally, but the wireless network card failed to load. I thought the card might have come loose, so I opened the case and reinstalled it. That&amp;rsquo;s when things went wrong – the system wouldn’t boot at all; the bootloader failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I messed with desktop computers, so partitioning is a bit unfamiliar. I used DisGenius to create a new blank partition (usually partitioned towards the front of the disk) and allocated it as an ESP partition (default 300M). Then, I rebuilt the boot in the PE system. You can find relevant information online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create New ESP Partition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can remove MSR partition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of computer storage, ESP partitions, GPT partition tables, and Windows operating systems are closely linked, each playing a unique and crucial role, jointly supporting the stable operation and efficient management of the system. However, before delving into them, it is necessary to mention the &amp;ldquo;predecessor&amp;rdquo; in the long history of computer partitioning—the MBR partition table format. It reflects the evolution of technology by contrasting with later technologies. Today, let&amp;rsquo;s deeply analyze their inherent connections and subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-mbr-partition-table--the-foundation-of-traditional-disk-partitioning&#34;&gt;I. MBR Partition Table – The &amp;ldquo;Foundation&amp;rdquo; of Traditional Disk Partitioning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;MBR, which stands for Master Boot Record, has existed since the early days of personal computers and has dominated the hard drive partitioning field for decades&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;basic-architecture&#34;&gt;Basic architecture
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is located in the first sector of the hard drive, also known as sector 0, and occupies 512 bytes. These 512 bytes are mainly divided into three parts: firstly, the boot program code, which is responsible for loading the operating system&amp;rsquo;s boot loader when the computer starts up, typically occupying 446 bytes; secondly, the disk partition table, occupying 64 bytes, which can define a maximum of 4 primary partition entries, each entry occupying 16 bytes and recording key parameters such as the starting head, sector, cylinder, and type and size of the partition; finally, the last 2 bytes are the MBR termination flag &amp;ldquo;55 AA&amp;rdquo;, used to identify this sector as a valid MBR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;historical-achievements-and-limitations&#34;&gt;Historical achievements and limitations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the MBR partition table fully met the relatively simple storage needs of personal computers. It allowed operating systems to smoothly recognize hard drive partitions and implement orderly data storage and retrieval. However, as times evolved, its limitations became increasingly apparent. On one hand, limited by the 64-byte space of the partition table, it could only support a maximum of four primary partitions. To create more partitions, complex methods such as extended partitions and logical partitions were required, which brought inconvenience to disk management; on the other hand, it supported a maximum hard drive capacity of only 2TB, which seemed inadequate in the face of high-capacity drives that are now often several TB or even tens of TB, becoming a bottleneck restricting further development of storage technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-esp-partition--the-systems-invisible-boot-key&#34;&gt;II. ESP Partition – The System&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Invisible Boot Key&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESP, which stands for EFI System Partition, is a special partition required by computers based on the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) standard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The boot process: When the computer is powered on, the UEFI firmware first searches for the ESP partition on the hard drive and reads the boot loader stored there (such as Windows Boot Manager), then starts the operating system. It&amp;rsquo;s like a precise key that opens the door to system startup; without it, the system will be lost and confused at startup, not knowing where to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The storage drive also stores some drivers essential for the system startup process, ensuring that hardware devices such as hard disk controllers and graphics cards function properly during the early boot phase, laying the foundation for the subsequent smooth takeover by the operating system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;space-requirements-and-format&#34;&gt;Space requirements and format
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, the recommended size for the ESP partition is between 100MB and 500MB, and allocating around 200MB is usually sufficient to meet basic needs. Its file system format must be FAT32 because UEFI firmware can only recognize FAT32 when reading boot files, ensuring compatibility and cross-platform support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-gpt-partition-table--the-smart-manager-of-your-hard-drive&#34;&gt;III. GPT Partition Table – The &amp;ldquo;Smart Manager&amp;rdquo; of Your Hard Drive
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT (GUID Partition Table), also known as a Global Unique Identifier Partition Table, is a new partitioning scheme designed to replace traditional MBR partition tables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advantages-revealed&#34;&gt;Advantages revealed
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Capacity Support:&lt;/strong&gt; In today&amp;rsquo;s era of data explosion, high-capacity hard drives are constantly emerging. The GPT partition table breaks through the 2TB capacity limitation of MBR and theoretically supports up to 9.4ZB (Zettabytes, 1 ZB = 1024 EB, 1 EB = 1024 PB, 1 PB = 1024 TB) of extremely large storage space, making it possible to store massive amounts of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike MBR, which can only have a maximum of four primary partitions, GPT allows for the creation of up to 128 partitions, providing users and system administrators with great flexibility. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s partitioning multiple system partitions, data partitions, or reserving partitions for special purposes, it handles everything smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High reliability: The GPT partition table utilizes a redundant backup mechanism, storing partition information in both the head and tail of the hard drive. When one partition table is damaged, the system can automatically recover from another backup, significantly reducing the risk of data loss due to partition table failures and safeguarding data security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;structural-analysis&#34;&gt;Structural Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GPT partition table consists of several parts, including a protective MBR (retained for compatibility with traditional BIOS as a small portion of the MBR structure but not used for actual partitioning management), a GPT header (which stores basic information about the GPT partition table, such as the partition table version, number of partitions, and partition table size), and an array of partition entries (each partition entry details key information such as the starting sector, ending sector, partition type GUID, and unique partition identifier). These structures work together to precisely plan and manage disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-windows-operating-system--a-digital-interaction-realm-for-users&#34;&gt;Four, Windows Operating System – A “Digital Interaction Realm” for Users
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows, as a globally widely used operating system, builds a friendly bridge between people and computer hardware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;integration-with-esp-partitions-and-gpt-partition-tables&#34;&gt;Integration with ESP partitions and GPT partition tables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Windows installation process on systems booting based on UEFI, the installer automatically creates an ESP (EFI System Partition) and deploys boot files within it. At the same time, the hard drive is initialized with a GPT (GUID Partition Table), partitioning out a system reserved partition (used to store system critical files, similar to the system boot file area in traditional BIOS), a Windows system partition (where the system core files are installed), and other user-defined data partitions. The Windows system relies on the GPT partition table to accurately identify each partition, smoothly booting through the ESP partition, with seamless integration between the three, providing users with a smooth startup and usage experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reliance-on-system-management-and-optimization&#34;&gt;Reliance on system management and optimization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows leverages the advantages of the GPT partition table for disk management during operation. For example, in the Disk Management tool, GPT partitions can be easily recognized, allowing users to conveniently create, delete, format partitions, and adjust their sizes, meeting data storage needs at different stages. Furthermore, system updates, software installations, and other processes are closely related to the partition layout; a reasonable partitioning scheme helps improve system performance and stability, reducing problems caused by insufficient disk space or partition confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v-practical-tips-maintenance-and-troubleshooting&#34;&gt;V. Practical Tips: Maintenance and Troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding their close relationship makes troubleshooting and maintenance more systematic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disk-space-management&#34;&gt;Disk space management
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly check the ESP partition space to avoid issues caused by insufficient space due to installing too many startup items or related software, which can affect system boot. For data partitions under GPT partitioning, plan storage reasonably and promptly clean up unnecessary files to prevent a single partition from becoming full and affecting system operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;troubleshooting-startup-issues&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting startup issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the system fails to start, first check if the ESP partition is damaged or files are missing. You can use the startup repair tool built into the UEFI firmware, or enter the recovery environment through a Windows installation medium to rebuild the boot files of the ESP partition. If you suspect a GPT partition table failure, use professional disk tools (such as DiskGenius) to check the integrity of the partition table and attempt to repair and restore backup partition information to recover lost partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESP partitions, GPT partition tables, and the Windows operating system are like a precise team working together, each playing their part to create a stable and efficient computing environment for us. A deep understanding of them not only helps us feel confident during system installation and maintenance but also allows us to understand the underlying logic of computer operation and freely explore the digital world. At the same time, reflecting on the rise and fall of the MBR partition table further reminds us of the power of technological progress, which drives storage technology forward to adapt to the ever-increasing demand for data storage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the field of C++ development, GCC and GLIBC are two indispensable key elements, and compatibility issues after program release often trouble developers. This article will deeply analyze their essence, explore the root causes of compatibility problems, and discuss coping strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-gcc-a-powerful-compiler-foundation&#34;&gt;I. GCC: A Powerful Compiler Foundation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definition and Function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCC, which stands for GNU Compiler Collection, is an open-source compiler suite developed by the GNU project. It&amp;rsquo;s far from a typical compiler; it supports various mainstream languages including C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, and Go, providing a one-stop solution for cross-language development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, with C++, when we write a source file containing complex features such as classes, templates, and function overloading, GCC can convert the high-level C++ code into an instruction sequence that the underlying machine can understand and execute, based on C++&amp;rsquo;s strict syntax and semantic rules. This process involves multiple fine-grained stages including lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compilation Process Explained&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The preprocessing stage: GCC first performs preprocessing on the source file. During this period, it handles all directives that begin with &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt; directive embeds the entire content of the specified header file (such as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for C++ input/output stream operations) into the corresponding position in the source file, allowing the program to use the functions, classes, and other resources declared in the header file; macros defined by the &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; directive are also expanded and replaced at this stage. For example, &lt;code&gt;#define PI 3.14159&lt;/code&gt;; all occurrences of &lt;code&gt;PI&lt;/code&gt; in the source file will be replaced with &lt;code&gt;3.14159&lt;/code&gt;. After preprocessing, the source file is initially “expanded.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The compilation stage: The preprocessed file enters the compilation link, where GCC, based on the C++ language standard, converts the source file into assembly language code. It carefully checks the code structure to ensure correct class inheritance, polymorphism implementation, and function call parameter matching. If it finds any errors that do not conform to syntax or semantics, it will promptly report an error and terminate the compilation process. For example, if there is a mismatch between the function declaration and definition&amp;rsquo;s parameter list, GCC will precisely point out the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assembly phase: The assembler converts the assembly code generated in the previous step into machine code, producing target files with a &lt;code&gt;.o&lt;/code&gt; extension. These target files contain binary instructions that can be directly executed by the machine, but they cannot run independently because a complete program typically consists of multiple modules with unresolved function and variable references between them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The linking phase: This is the final sprint stage in generating an executable file. The linker integrates multiple object files and required library files (static or dynamic libraries) together. For example, when we use container classes from the C++ Standard Template Library, the linker needs to find the corresponding library implementation code during linking to ensure that the program can correctly call the functions of &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; and other containers at runtime, ultimately generating a complete executable program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-glibc-the-behind-the-scenes-pillar-for-c-program-execution&#34;&gt;II. GLIBC: The Behind-the-Scenes Pillar for C++ Program Execution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essence and Function
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GLIBC, or the GNU C Library, is a specific implementation of the C standard library within the GNU ecosystem. Although the name highlights its connection to C, C++ programs are equally reliant on it because C++ inherits the foundational aspects of C. It provides a vast number of basic functions, such as &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; (dynamic memory allocation) and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; (memory release), which are essential when creating dynamic arrays and objects in C++; string processing functions like &lt;code&gt;strcpy&lt;/code&gt; (string copy) and &lt;code&gt;strcat&lt;/code&gt; (string concatenation), even though C++ has more advanced &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; classes, are still used for interacting with C code at a lower level or pursuing extreme performance; and standard input/output functions such as &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt;, which frequently appear in early C++ development and in scenarios that are sensitive to performance and prioritize simplicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coordination with the operating system
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GLIBC acts as a crucial bridge between the operating system and applications. In Linux systems, when a C++ program makes a system call, such as opening a file (using the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; function, which relies on GLIBC implementation), GLIBC encapsulates the program&amp;rsquo;s request in a way that the operating system kernel expects and passes it to the kernel. After the kernel processes the request, GLIBC returns the result to the application. It allows applications to use various system resources, such as file systems, networks, and process management functions, conveniently without needing to understand the complex details of the underlying system call interfaces of the operating system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-analysis-of-compatibility-issues-after-c-program-release&#34;&gt;III. Analysis of Compatibility Issues After C++ Program Release
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatibility Issues Caused by GLIBC Version Differences
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different Linux distributions often use different versions of GLIBC. When a C++ program is compiled in a high-version GLIBC environment, it may inadvertently use certain new features or rely on more optimized function implementations added in that version. For example, newer GLIBC versions have improved memory allocation algorithms, and programs frequently take advantage of these new algorithms to improve performance at runtime. Once this program is ported to a system with an older GLIBC version, it may encounter issues such as missing functions (because the function was not introduced in the older version) or abnormal function behavior (due to discrepancies between the old and new implementations), leading to program crashes or incorrect results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatibility issues caused by compiler differences
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when using the same GCC compiler, different versions of GCC can vary in code generation, standard library support, and implementation details regarding C++ features. Newer GCC versions may offer complete support for the latest C++ standards (such as new features like modules and coroutines in C++20). If a program utilizes these cutting-edge features and is compiled under an older version of GCC, the compiler will report errors due to its inability to recognize these new syntax structures; even if there are no syntax errors, different optimization strategies across GCC versions can result in machine code that differs significantly in execution efficiency and memory usage. This difference can lead to vastly different program behavior in demanding performance scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenges Brought by System Architecture Differences
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++ programs may need to run on different hardware system architectures, such as x86, ARM, and PowerPC. Different architectures have their own unique instruction sets, memory layouts, and data alignment requirements. For example, the storage layout of a structure that runs normally on the x86 architecture can cause abnormal memory access and subsequent program errors on the ARM architecture due to different alignment rules; moreover, the machine code generated by GCC when compiling for different architectures differs greatly. If the program contains hardcoded architecture-specific instructions or assumptions, cross-architecture runtime failures are inevitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strategies-for-addressing-compatibility-issues&#34;&gt;Strategies for Addressing Compatibility Issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Use of Static Link Libraries
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using a static library, which directly packages the code of libraries such as GLIBC that the program depends on into the executable file. This eliminates the program&amp;rsquo;s dependence on a specific version of GLIBC on the target system, effectively avoiding issues caused by GLIBC version mismatches. However, static linking significantly increases the size of the executable file and requires weighing the pros and cons in scenarios with limited storage resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Containerized Deployment
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By leveraging containerization technologies like Docker, the C++ program and its required runtime environment (including specific versions of GCC, GLIBC, etc.) are encapsulated within a standalone container. Regardless of the underlying operating system it is deployed on, the container consistently maintains the environment as it was during development, ensuring the program runs as expected and greatly simplifying cross-environment deployment complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatibility Testing and Continuous Integration
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a comprehensive compatibility testing system covering different GLIBC versions, GCC versions, and common system architectures. During the development process, use continuous integration tools to regularly perform automated tests in multiple environments. Address any compatibility issues promptly to eliminate potential risks at their inception and ensure stability after program launch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, a deep understanding of the workings of GCC and GLIBC, an accurate grasp of the root causes of C++ program compatibility issues, and the ability to apply appropriate strategies are essential skills for every C++ developer aiming to build robust, cross-platform applications. Only in this way can our C++ works navigate diverse technical ecosystems smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Windows&#39; built-in Disk Cleanup tool: Storage</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-disk-cleanup-storage/</link>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-disk-cleanup-storage/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure from what version it started, but in &lt;code&gt;Windows 11&lt;/code&gt;, the Disk Cleanup tool has been significantly improved and is now much smarter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an official tool, so it won’t delete files by mistake, has no ads, no pop-ups, no background processes, and nothing unnecessary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Windows 11, you can open Disk Cleanup through Settings - System - Storage - Temporary files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinary users can simply select &amp;ldquo;Clean-up Suggestions,&amp;rdquo; and the system will provide recommendations based on your usage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I have many temporary files on my disk, so I chose &amp;ldquo;Temporary Files,&amp;rdquo; which contains various temporary files such as those from &lt;code&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Windows Update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temporary file&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Docker domestic image proxy failure</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/docker-domestic-mirror-failure/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 18:29:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/docker-domestic-mirror-failure/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Deploying Docker on domestic servers. If the company doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide an image registry, developers must first configure a domestic mirror acceleration address. Conveniently, I have a server today that has been configured with a mirror acceleration address, but it can’t pull images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error response from daemon: Get &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/%22&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/&#34;&lt;/a&gt;: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two days, all servers have been restored, and surprisingly this didn&amp;rsquo;t trend. All domestic mirror proxies are down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting-and-repair-attempts&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting and Repair Attempts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, I tried switching to other mirror acceleration addresses hoping to resolve the issue, but it backfired and the problem persists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, I began modifying the local DNS configuration, attempting to find a breakthrough at the network resolution level; unfortunately, after some debugging, the fault still persisted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the stability of the local network was seriously questioned, so I immediately switched to my phone&amp;rsquo;s hotspot in an attempt to bypass any potential issues with the local network. However, the result was still frustrating; there were no signs of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-is-spreading&#34;&gt;The problem is spreading
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We still have several servers deployed domestically, all with Docker environments installed. I tried pulling images on these servers, hoping to find an alternative solution, but without exception, they failed to pull successfully. The error messages were identical across all devices, indicating the problem wasn&amp;rsquo;t limited to a single machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further investigation revealed that the mirror proxy seemed to have failed instantly. At this critical moment, we quickly switched to an overseas machine for a trial attempt. Fortunately, image pulling resumed here, which suggests the problem likely lies within the domestic network link or related configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strategic-adjustment-resolving-issues-indirectly&#34;&gt;Strategic adjustment: resolving issues indirectly
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the numerous obstacles to directly pulling images within China, while foreign mirrors are accessible, in order to expedite project progress, we have decided to adopt a circumspect approach. First, switch to a foreign server to successfully pull the required images, then push them to a domestic mirror repository, thereby establishing a &amp;ldquo;data bridge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I modified the Dockerfile and replaced the image address with one suitable for domestic environments, then rebuilt the image and successfully deployed it&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The End of the Era of Wild Capitalism: The League of Legends Esports Era Ends</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-era-league-of-legends-esports/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:19:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-era-league-of-legends-esports/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The esports industry has experienced rapid development over the past decade and a half, becoming an undeniable cultural phenomenon worldwide. In particular, MOBA games represented by 《英雄联盟》(League of Legends, abbreviated as LOL) not only provide players with competitive enjoyment but also inject powerful momentum for capital, driving the flourishing growth of various esports platforms and events. However, with the influx of capital and the rise of the pan-entertainment industry, all this has entered a stage of gradual decline. The rise and fall of Panda TV, and the competition between Douyu and Huya, mark the end of the “era of wild capitalism,” and the favorable conditions, location, and people for the esports industry seem to be undergoing changes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-investment&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Investment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early esports: from grassroots to professionalism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early esports industry had a relatively grassroots start, especially in the Chinese market. Many players participated in competitions for games like StarCraft and Dota, driven by their love of gaming. However, the true rise of esports began with the release and promotion of League of Legends. After League of Legends officially entered the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche circle into part of mainstream culture. Particularly starting in 2013, the LPL (Chinese professional league) steadily took shape, and League of Legends became the cornerstone of China&amp;rsquo;s esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital is pouring in wildly: The Rise of Panda TV and Esports Streaming Platforms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 was a turning point for the esports industry in China. The influx of capital transformed esports from purely competitive events into a much larger industrial chain. Panda TV, as one of its representatives, became a product of excess capital. Founded by Wang Sicong (one of the founders of Panda Live), it quickly rose to prominence, attracting a large audience and user base with its innovative content and massive investment. However, this was also a typical example of &amp;ldquo;barbaric&amp;rdquo; capital flowing into the market – the frantic pursuit of capital often lacks patience and long-term vision. While Panda TV&amp;rsquo;s financial and human resources resulted in certain achievements in the short term, it ultimately declared bankruptcy in 2019 due to management issues and over-reliance on capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live Streaming Platform Competition: A &amp;ldquo;Capital War&amp;rdquo; Between Douyu and Huya&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fall of Panda TV did not lead to a decline in the esports live streaming industry, but rather spurred the rise of platforms like Douyu and Huya. The two major live streaming platforms quickly became leaders in the esports industry, and their competition intensified. Douyu initially gained prominence through the broadcast of League of Legends professional matches and the signing of top streamers, establishing itself as a benchmark for esports live streaming. Huya, on the other hand, gradually narrowed the gap with Douyu by increasing investment in esports events and diversifying its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this process, capital once again played a significant role. Bilibili successfully went public in 2018, and Huya also conducted an IPO that same year. The rapid flow of capital led to high concentration within the industry and resulted in intense competition between platforms regarding anchors, copyrights, and other aspects, forming a &amp;ldquo;capital war.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-convergence-of-pan-entertainment-and-esports&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Convergence of Pan-Entertainment and Esports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trend of Pan-Entertainment: Capital Flows Towards Diversified Entertainment Projects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With renewed investment from capital in the esports industry, the content on esports platforms is gradually becoming more entertainment-focused. Esports anchors are no longer limited to match commentary and event broadcasts; they have begun to expand into various forms of entertainment such as singing, dancing, and interactive live streams. The platform&amp;rsquo;s content has become richer, gradually forming a content ecosystem centered around esports but incorporating diverse entertainment elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the trend of pervasive entertainment has also brought problems – esports&amp;rsquo; original focus on gaming culture is gradually being marginalized, replaced by a trend that prioritizes entertainment above all else. This trend has caused some viewers who were originally deeply passionate about esports culture to feel alienated, and capital has begun to shift its attention to other entertainment sectors. The excessive influx of capital and the pursuit of profit are causing the essence of the esports industry to gradually become blurred, and the core value concept centered on competition is beginning to weaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rise of the Pan-Entertainment Industry: Capital Retreat and Transformation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and other pan-entertainment industries have risen, capital has gradually shifted funds from esports to a broader range of entertainment content. In this process, giants like Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance no longer rely solely on esports projects as a source of profit but have increased their investment in areas such as film, music, and short videos. Particularly the rise of ByteDance, through the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin, has overshadowed esports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-the-break-in-continuity-of-the-league-of-legends-era-dividends-fade&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: The &amp;ldquo;Break in Continuity&amp;rdquo; of the League of Legends: Era Dividends Fade
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since League of Legends entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has almost become synonymous with the esports industry in China, creating countless professional players, teams, and events, and fostering a massive esports ecosystem. However, more than ten years have passed, and as a leading project in Chinese esports, League of Legends is entering a stage of “generational shift.” Especially in recent years, League of Legends&amp;rsquo; influence has been gradually declining, and even showing clear signs of recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layering of Player Groups
The most noticeable change is the generational shift in the player base. Initially, esports&amp;rsquo; rapid development relied on the support of a large number of young players, many of whom became professional players or viewers because of League of Legends. That generation of internet-addicted youth almost grew up under &amp;ldquo;demographic dividend,&amp;rdquo; immersed in the competitive appeal of LOL and thus driving the industry’s rapid expansion. However, as time passed, these players gradually matured, entered society, and began to shift towards other life and career paths. At the same time, the new generation of young players&amp;rsquo; interest in League of Legends is not as fervent as it used to be, and esports audiences are showing a clear age bias and declining interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.2 The &amp;ldquo;Weakness&amp;rdquo; of Game Content
League of Legends, after numerous updates and revisions, while still retaining a certain competitive appeal, has shown signs of struggling to innovate. Annual version updates, hero balance adjustments, and the introduction of new gameplay mechanics have seemingly failed to fundamentally address players&amp;rsquo; need for novelty. At the same time, the MOBA market is becoming saturated, and other game genres (such as Honor of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite) have rapidly risen in popularity, diverting a large number of players who previously played League of Legends. This competitive landscape has kept League of Legends perpetually in the role of a &amp;ldquo;follower.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-where-will-the-esports-industry-go-from-here&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Where will the esports industry go from here?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The esports industry is more like a skyscraper that sprung up seemingly out of nowhere. Excessive capital wanders within the internet sector, searching for the next trend, and esports has become one of their targets. Relying on China&amp;rsquo;s demographic dividend, the esports industry achieved tremendous success in a short period, but this success isn’t built on a solid foundation. Over-investment of capital, talent shortages, and weak game content – these issues are all hindering the healthy development of the esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before college, I didn&amp;rsquo;t play many games. League of Legends accompanied a generation’s growth. Having watched so many finals, as an outsider, comparing Chinese and Korean players, especially Faker, domestic players always feel hesitant and fearful during major tournaments. I understand the psychological pressure on players is immense, but this industry has been developing for over ten years. Psychological issues among players should have been prioritized by teams, but they haven’t been. The gameplay in China still relies on players&amp;rsquo; innate talent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>From Games to Family: Why We Gradually Disconnect from Virtual Worlds as We Grow Up</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:11:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thinking about when gaming is most enjoyable, is it sneaking away as a child to play Tank Battle, Super Mario, and Contra on the family TV, or secretly playing Age of Empires with my cousin on the family computer, or perhaps later in college, playing games like Devil May Cry and League of Legends with my roommates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you were a child, free from life&amp;rsquo;s worries, when you played, you really put your whole heart into it – that sense of immersion is something you can never find again as an adult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As times change and society progresses, we who were once active in the virtual world are gradually realizing that the gaming platform, once full of joy and competition, seems to be drifting away from our lives. The disconnection of game social links, accompanied by players gradually moving on, is not only due to technological advancements and the replacement of games themselves, but also because of a shift in the center of our lives. As we grow older, we become busy with marriage and having children, and the main focus of life gradually shifts from personal entertainment to family responsibilities. Today, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss the deeper reasons behind this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disappearance-of-gaming-socialization-a-tug-of-war-between-virtual-and-real-worlds&#34;&gt;The Disappearance of Gaming Socialization: A Tug-of-War Between Virtual and Real Worlds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people&amp;rsquo;s youth, games were more than just entertainment; they were a way to socialize. A popular online multiplayer game not only provided in-game challenges and competition but also connected players from all over the world, building virtual social circles. In that era, playing dungeons and team PKing with friends was part of life. Those late-night voice chats and sharing daily experiences became part of our memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as time passed, more and more players discovered that this virtual social experience didn&amp;rsquo;t have lasting appeal. With game updates and the diversification of social platforms, players gradually found more ways to interact outside of games. Friends made in games slowly disappeared from our lives, and many connections once active within the games were silently severed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;games-and-responsibility-a-shift-in-lifes-focus-after-adulthood&#34;&gt;Games and Responsibility: A Shift in Life&amp;rsquo;s Focus After Adulthood
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entering adulthood, the responsibilities in life gradually increase. Many young people once invested a lot of time in games, but with the start of their careers or living together with partners and starting families, these previously seemingly essential leisure activities begin to be squeezed by the responsibilities of real life. Marriage, having children, or even caring for parents – these major responsibilities in life force people to make choices about energy and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming has become a thing of the past, replaced by the prioritization of family life. Many young people who once &amp;ldquo;struggled&amp;rdquo; in games are gradually realizing that real-life is the most important subject. Especially after having children, the center of gravity in their lives completely shifts towards family, and gaming is gradually squeezed to the periphery of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-games-to-family-how-changes-in-life-affect-our-entertainment-habits&#34;&gt;From Games to Family: How Changes in Life Affect Our Entertainment Habits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our life experiences, family is one of the most important components. Once we enter family life, the allocation of time and energy becomes more specific and limited. To take care of children and spend time with their partners, many young parents find that they no longer have enough time to focus on the games they once loved. Sometimes, they even stop pursuing game updates and new features. Gradually, social platforms and offline interactions with friends and family become the preferred choice for socializing for more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we’ve completely abandoned entertainment, but rather chosen ways that are more suitable for our current life stage. Many friends who used to maintain connections through games may now choose other ways to stay in touch due to different life paths, such as family gatherings, meals together, and short trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;farewell-to-the-virtual-world-how-do-we-view-this-transition&#34;&gt;Farewell to the virtual world: How do we view this transition?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many who once immersed themselves in gaming, saying goodbye to game-related social interactions isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. After all, that virtual world that once brought us joy and a sense of accomplishment has long become part of our memories. However, farewell doesn’t mean severing ties completely; instead, as life changes, we begin to make different choices to balance our roles in real life. As we grow older, we transition from inexperienced youths into responsible adults, and while gaming still holds value, it can no longer be the main theme of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this shift also reflects an aspect of human adaptability—our ability to adjust our focus and lifestyle according to different stages. When responsibility and family become the core of life, gaming socialization is no longer a priority but rather a form of occasional leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-of-gaming-perhaps-it-will-usher-in-another-wave-of-sense-of-belonging&#34;&gt;The future of gaming: perhaps it will usher in another wave of &amp;ldquo;sense of belonging.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, with social development and technological advancements, the forms and content of games are also constantly evolving. For example, current online multiplayer games have begun to move towards more relaxed and flexible approaches, and some even emphasize family interaction and parent-child relationships in their design. In the future, we may see more game formats that better integrate into family life and provide players with healthier, more balanced social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as many people still feel nostalgia and passion when talking about &amp;ldquo;childhood games,&amp;rdquo; perhaps in the future, we too may unexpectedly pick up those old games again, entering that virtual world once more with new understanding and insights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-is-changing-but-love-remains&#34;&gt;Life is changing, but love remains
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s games or family, the changes in life always accompany our growth. In this process, we gradually realize that although the virtual world brings us endless joy and excitement, ultimately, we return to reality, to that warmest place – family. We don’t need to regret leaving games behind, because every stage of life has its own unique meaning. And these changes are precisely what make us become more complete individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Hong Kong Stock Exchange, History of Cryptocurrency Development</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-stock-exchange-virtual-currency-history/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:00:28 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-stock-exchange-virtual-currency-history/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s re-election as US President, virtual currency has once again entered the public consciousness. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) has also been actively deploying related businesses; here is a brief record of HKEX’s development history regarding virtual currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the details of the relevant contract list, I discovered that what was initially introduced wasn&amp;rsquo;t spot trading but futures. This is reasonable because the liquidity in the futures market is better and it’s easier to attract institutional investors. The subsequent introduction of spot ETFs was also reasonable, as ETFs are a more readily accepted investment tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cryptocurrency-list&#34;&gt;Cryptocurrency List
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Stock Exchange&amp;rsquo;s market data does not provide an identifier to distinguish whether a contract is a virtual currency, but it can be determined by the contract name. The official transaction list, however, provides the corresponding subcategory &lt;code&gt;virtualasset&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.hkex.com.hk/Market-Data/Securities-Prices/Exchange-Traded-Products?sc_lang=en&amp;amp;asset=virtualasset&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;december-16-2022&#34;&gt;December 16, 2022
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;hong-kong-exchange-welcomes-listing-of-asias-first-cryptocurrency-etfs&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Exchange Welcomes Listing of Asia’s First Cryptocurrency ETFs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Markets Limited (HKEX) today (Friday) welcomed the listing of Asia’s first cryptocurrency ETFs, further expanding its product ecosystem and providing more choices for investors in Hong Kong and internationally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two newly listed ETFs today — Southern East Investment Bitcoin Futures ETF (stock code: 3066) and Southern East Investment Ethereum Futures ETF (stock code: 3068) — are managed by Southern East Asset Management Co., Ltd. They track standardized, cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts and ethereum futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Chief Operating Officer and Co-Head of Markets, Nicole Yau, said: &amp;ldquo;The two cryptocurrency ETFs listed today add another layer to Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s increasingly rich and diverse ecosystem of exchange-traded products. These new products will provide investors in Asia with their first opportunity to participate in digital asset investments, and reflect our focus on the digital economy and market demand. We look forward to welcoming more thematic ETFs and new digital asset products in the coming months.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETFs are one of the fastest-growing businesses under Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, with a constantly expanding and increasingly diversified range of products. In 2022, they launched their first Metaverse ETF, their first carbon futures ETF, and their first blockchain ETF, and for the first time included ETFs in the Shanghai–Hong Kong Stock Connect scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average daily turnover of products listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (ETPs, including ETFs and leveraged and inverse products) for the first ten months of this year was HK$11.8 billion, a 50% increase from HK$7.8 billion in the same period last year, reflecting the growing popularity of ETPs among investors. As of November 2022, there were 168 ETPs listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with a total market capitalization of HK$373.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;april-30-2024&#34;&gt;April 30, 2024
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;hong-kong-exchanges-and-clearing-welcomes-the-listing-of-the-first-virtual-asset-spot-etfs&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing welcomes the listing of the first virtual asset spot ETFs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Markets Limited (HKEX) today (Tuesday) welcomed the listing of Asia’s first virtual asset spot ETFs, expanding the range of products in the Hong Kong market and providing investors with a wider selection, solidifying Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s position as a leading ETF market in Asia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Head of Securities Product Development Robert Lo said: &amp;ldquo;The newly launched virtual asset spot ETF will enrich Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing&amp;rsquo;s diverse and vibrant ETF market ecosystem, providing investors with investment opportunities in a new asset class. Following the successful launch of virtual asset futures ETFs one year ago, Asia’s first batch of virtual asset spot ETFs will further enhance the variety and liquidity of tradable products on Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing. We look forward to continuing to work closely with market participants to introduce more new products into our internationalized market.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first batch of virtual asset futures ETFs listed in 2022 have been highly favored by investors and enjoyed brisk trading. The average daily turnover of the three virtual asset futures ETFs listed in Hong Kong increased from HK$8.9 million in 2023 to HK$51.3 million in the first quarter of 2024, while also attracting net inflows of HK$529 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange trading of products (including ETFs, leveraged and inverse products) is one of the fastest-growing markets in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, with a continuously increasing variety of product types. The 16 newly launched ETF products in 2023 and Q1 2024 include Asia’s first Saudi Arabia ETF and Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s first exchange-traded fund linked to options, bringing the total number of ETFs listed in Hong Kong to 179.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;october-28-2024&#34;&gt;October 28, 2024
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;hong-kong-exchanges-and-clearing-will-launch-a-series-of-virtual-asset-indices&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing will launch a series of virtual asset indices
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) today (Monday) announced that it will launch the HKEX Virtual Asset Index Series (the Index Series) on November 15, 2024, to provide a reliable benchmark price for the rapidly growing asset class of virtual assets, supporting Hong Kong’s development as Asia&amp;rsquo;s leading digital asset hub&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This index series will provide a transparent and reliable benchmark for the pricing of Bitcoin and Ethereum in Asian time zones, committed to providing a unified reference price for virtual assets and resolving price discrepancies between global exchanges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Chief Executive Officer Nicolas Aguzin said: &amp;ldquo;We are pleased to launch the Hong Kong Exchange Virtual Asset Index Series to meet the demand in the region for this rapidly growing asset class. By providing a transparent and reliable real-time benchmark, we hope to help investors make informed investment decisions, thereby supporting the healthy development of the virtual asset ecosystem and consolidating Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s position as an international financial center.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of this index series is part of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing&amp;rsquo;s commitment to exploring emerging areas, supporting the development of financial technology in Hong Kong while also providing investors with important benchmark tools and solutions in a constantly changing market environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index series will include reference indices for Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as reference exchange rates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference index is based on a benchmark spot price, weighted by the 24-hour trading volume of Bitcoin or Ethereum, and calculated according to aggregated market prices from multiple major virtual asset exchanges, quoted in US dollars. The reference rate is designed for financial product settlement and is calculated daily at 4:00 PM Hong Kong time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This index series will be the first in Hong Kong to comply with European Union Benchmark Regulation (BMR), and will be jointly managed and calculated by a benchmark management agency registered in the UK and virtual asset data and index provider CCData&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region released a policy statement on virtual assets in 2022, aiming to foster a vibrant virtual asset industry and ecosystem in Hong Kong. The launch of the Hong Kong Exchange Virtual Asset Index Series will help the public increase their understanding of virtual asset investment trends by providing real-time data and daily reference prices in the Asian time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details regarding the design and calculation methods of the index series will be released in due course&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fees have been reduced, fees have been reduced; several large domestic ETFs have lowered their fees</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/reduced-fees-large-domestic-etf/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 03:08:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/reduced-fees-large-domestic-etf/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Huatai Pioneer’s CSI 300 ETF and related announcements have lowered the comprehensive fee rate to the lowest tier among its peers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 19th, China Tai Ping Fund announced that to better meet the investment and financial management needs of a wide range of investors, starting from November 22nd, it will adjust the management fees and custody fees for China Tai Ping Huatai Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 ETF and its linked funds, and revise relevant content in the corresponding fund contracts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjustments, the annual management fee for China Tai Ping Prudential Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 ETF and its linked funds has been reduced to 0.15%, and the annual custody fee has been reduced to 0.05%, both adjusted to the lowest tier of fees for index funds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost simultaneously, leading ETFs in the industry such as ChinaAMC CSI 300 ETF, ChinaAMC SSE 50 ETF, NFAT Zhongcai 500 ETF, JIA SHI CSI 300 ETF, and Yifangda Growth Enterprise ETF also announced reductions in management fees and custody fees, with rates all lowered to 0.15% and 0.05%, respectively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most ETF fee reductions in the past, this one was driven by proactive action from a product with scale advantages within the market, and will have a greater impact on the industry going forward. Exchange data shows that as of November 18th, the size of Caitong B&amp;amp;R CSI 300 ETF exceeded 370 billion yuan, making it the largest ETF in the current market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of super ETFs has taken the lead in reducing fees, demonstrating a willingness to benefit investors and allowing them to invest in popular and liquid funds with higher value for money&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry experts believe that fee reductions for ETFs with economies of scale will, on the one hand, help to fulfill the role of mutual funds in providing inclusive financial services, benefiting a wider range of investors by reducing holding costs, increasing potential returns, and enhancing their investment experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, low fees also help to further enhance the competitiveness of the product itself. With the support of liquidity absorption and cost operation advantages, the product is expected to attract more long-term incremental capital into the market, helping to build a good ecosystem for &amp;ldquo;long money, long investment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, thanks to its unique advantages such as flexible trading, high transparency, strong liquidity, and low investment threshold, broad-based ETFs have become a primary channel for investors entering the market with modest capital and pursuing long-term investments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This price reduction could become a sort of &amp;ldquo;accelerator,&amp;rdquo; making it easier for large investors to enter the A-share market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fixed-investment fund I chose, Tianhong Fund, hasn&amp;rsquo;t released an announcement yet, but it should follow suit. If there’s no update, I’ll have to consider switching funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original management fee: 0.5%, custody fee: 0.1%. New management fee: 0.15%, custody fee: 0.05%. This is still a significant reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Increased scrutiny of third-party investment advisors; reckoning for those behind TikTok stock trading</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/third-party-wealth-managers-scrutiny-tiktok-stock-winners-crackdown/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:59:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/third-party-wealth-managers-scrutiny-tiktok-stock-winners-crackdown/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The sledgehammer is falling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokerage services, boosted by short videos, are likely entering a fast track&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late September of this year, after a period of strong performance in the A-share market, Douyin stock recommendations received attention from various parties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several financial news anchors, including &amp;ldquo;Da Lan,&amp;rdquo; have gained popularity on Douyin, indirectly causing some volatility in the capital market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of popular financial news anchors also shouldn&amp;rsquo;t overlook the power behind them – third-party wealth management firms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to sources, many third-party investment advisory firms operate multiple accounts on short video platforms, using traffic allocation to attract users to watch investment education videos and boost their enthusiasm for purchasing related investment advisory products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors also suggest that a certain third-party investment advisory firm earned 1 billion yuan in revenue this October alone, exceeding its income for the entire first half of the year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &amp;ldquo;good times&amp;rdquo; are facing more uncertainties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since November, various departments have issued documents requiring securities service institutions to strengthen compliance management of their social media accounts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of November 15th, Tonghua Shun (300033.SZ) announced that its subsidiary was penalized by the China Securities Regulatory Commission due to live streaming activities involving implied stock recommendations and other behaviors
This could be signaling that regulators are tightening their oversight of the market
The promotion of services by third-party investment advisory firms, including Nine Square Wisdom Investment (9636.HK), may also face increased pressure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strictly-monitored-and-watched-closely&#34;&gt;Strictly monitored and watched closely
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of short video platforms like Douyin has amplified emotional voices and indirectly influenced trading behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data from Jiali Digital, during the period of September 27th to October 8th, when transaction volume reached a new high, Douyin&amp;rsquo;s A-share keyword search index soared from 4.2384 million to 12.7786 million, more than doubling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under these circumstances, the actions of third-party investment advisory firms that are &amp;ldquo;adding fuel to the fire&amp;rdquo; are attracting the attention of regulatory authorities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokerage employees recommending individual stocks through live streams is a frequent violation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 8th, the Guangdong Securities Regulatory Bureau took regulatory measures to suspend the acceptance of new clients from a certain company due to instances such as &amp;ldquo;implying stock recommendations&amp;rdquo; in their live broadcasts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of November 14th, the Guangdong Securities and Futures Industry Association issued a document titled &amp;ldquo;Inadequate Live Stream Control, Institutions to be Suspended,&amp;rdquo; directly pointing out that some institutions with securities consulting qualifications had inadequate control during live stream promotional activities and engaged in recommending individual stocks during broadcasts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live stock recommendations are prohibited. Live streaming falls under public media dissemination, and live streamers, regardless of whether they are registered as securities investment advisors, are not permitted to recommend individual stocks during broadcasts. This was stated by the Guangdong Securities Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an isolated case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, the Shanghai Securities Regulatory Bureau’s penalty notice also included a case involving illegal stock recommendations on social media platforms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to regulatory investigation, Wang Yong, an investment consultant at the Shanghai branch of Haisun Securities Investment Consulting Co., Ltd., published misleading video content through WeChat Video Number, which violated professional conduct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Securities Regulatory Bureau took supervisory management measures of issuing a warning letter to Wang Yong regarding this matter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to information obtained by Feng (ID: TradeWind01), some investment advisor firms that do not meet the qualifications have been recommending stocks on Douyin through brokerage affiliations and have now been suspended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some people in the industry are doing live streams on Douyin, but they’re actually affiliated with brokerages, which gives them investment consultant qualifications. Then they use online live streams to attract customers and sell investment consultant combination products offline.” A wealth manager from South China told Xin Feng (ID: TradeWind01), “But later, because they were recommending stocks during the live stream, it was discovered, so they were suspended. Reputable brokerages generally have educational live streams that discuss sector conditions but don’t involve individual stocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, regulators are paying close attention to illegal stock recommendations on social media&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Shenzhen Securities Regulatory Bureau recently notified that individual institutions or individuals within the industry have been found to be engaging in illegal stock recommendations and other violations through self-media. To further regulate the operation and management of securities investment consulting agencies&amp;rsquo; self-media within its jurisdiction, each agency should strengthen the management of their own self-media operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may bring more challenges to the promotion of various third-party wealth management service providers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;traffic-businesses-are-illegal&#34;&gt;Traffic businesses are illegal
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether investors lured into the market by short videos have made money remains to be seen, but as &amp;ldquo;water sellers,&amp;rdquo; third-party investment advisory firms have already seen their value rise in the secondary market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a leading player in online investment education, Jiufang Intelligent Investment&amp;rsquo;s market capitalization has surged from 287.8 million yuan in early September to 1.2464 billion yuan at the close of trading on November 13th, representing an increase of 333.08% over 49 trading days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The semi-annual report shows that in the first half of this year, Jiufang Zhi Tou conducted brand exposure on social media platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu, reaching 488 accounts and 0.46 billion followers by the end of June this year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, as the chief investment consultant of Jiufang Zhito, &amp;ldquo;Hong Bangzhu&amp;rdquo; has 2.26 million followers on Douyin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are deeply engaged in MCN operations, focusing on users and collaboratively driving the comprehensive development of traffic, brands, and products. Jiufang Zhi投 (Jiufang Investment) pointed out that &amp;ldquo;By deeply integrating new media tools such as live streaming and short videos, leveraging AI technology to build fan networks, and actively exploring e-commerce models, we can effectively achieve efficient conversion of traffic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiufang Zhitou&amp;rsquo;s consultant courses cover a range of prices from several thousand yuan to over 130,000 yuan. The most expensive package, Super Investor, is priced at 139,600 yuan/six months and includes exclusive insights and private consultant services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, JIAF’s investment consultant products have a refund rate of over 10%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2024, the refund rates for Jiu Fang Zhi Tou&amp;rsquo;s flagship series and Jiu Fang Zhi Tou’s Qinlong series reached 14.7% and 18.5%, respectively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Jiufang Zhitu’s business development will be affected remains to be seen amid regulatory scrutiny&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent media reports indicate that accounts under third-party investment advisory firms such as Jiufang Zhi Tou have been affected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, media reported that &amp;ldquo;Hong Gangzhu&amp;rdquo; had been suspended from streaming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on November 15th in the afternoon, Xin Feng (ID: TradeWind01) searched for the account and found that the livestream appointment for November 18th was still available on the &amp;ldquo;Hong Gangzhu&amp;rdquo; livestreaming interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market news also indicates that relevant authorities have inspected Jufang Intelligence Investment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But individuals close to Nine Square Intelligence have told TradeWind (ID:TradeWind01) that the inspection is a routine check and has concluded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only company rumored to be caught up in this round of regulatory storm recently&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports indicate that Tonghua Shun is being investigated for allegedly illegally recommending stocks, and business operations may be suspended
In response, Tonghuashun stated on November 15th that &amp;ldquo;there is no illegal stock recommendation situation and there has been no investigation.&amp;rdquo;
However, that same evening, Tonghua Shun announced that its subsidiary, Zhejiang Tonghuashun Cloud Software Co., Ltd., was penalized by the Zhejiang Securities Regulatory Bureau with a suspension of acquiring new customers for three months and other penalties due to inadequate compliance management during the promotion of its live streaming business and instances of implying stock recommendations
Behind this, it may also mean that regulatory authorities&amp;rsquo; attention on promotional stock content on social media platforms like Douyin Live is being further upgraded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the short video market is also attracting many brokerages, but they are currently still cautious due to regulatory requirements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person from a securities firm told Xin Feng (ID: TradeWind01) that the company is exploring short video operations and methods for attracting traffic, and has also organized personnel to visit short video platform companies for learning. However, due to compliance requirements, it is still in the exploratory phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the various compliance requirements of regulation stem from the evident emotional coloring of content on short video platforms, but investment requires market participants to maintain rationality; the two are inherently in conflict&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If emotions influence the capital market, it can easily lead to sharp market fluctuations, which is contrary to the long-term healthy development of the capital market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How securities firms should embrace the arrival of the short video era while avoiding regulatory breaches is a difficult question for all parties involved&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s expired, what&amp;rsquo;s the problem? Besides security issues, DNF is no longer working. I noticed it failed when I installed a tool recently, and checking the mirror source revealed that &lt;code&gt;CentOS 8 Stream&lt;/code&gt; has expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-centos-stream&#34;&gt;Introduction to CentOS Stream
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;positioning-and-role&#34;&gt;Positioning and Role
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream sits between Fedora Linux (upstream development) and RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux, downstream development), acting as a bridge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be seen as a version for experiencing the latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux features, suitable for early adopters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;birth-and-background&#34;&gt;Birth and Background
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time went on, Red Hat began seeking more effective ways to develop its enterprise-level Linux platform and launched CentOS Stream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After CentOS 8 ended maintenance at the end of 2021, CentOS Stream continued to be updated as its successor and has become the future direction of the CentOS project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-and-advantages&#34;&gt;Features and Advantages
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream is a rolling-release Linux distribution that provides faster updates. It offers greater transparency and more opportunities for community, partner, and customer involvement, allowing users to contribute to Red Hat Enterprise Linux more quickly and directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of CentOS Stream is software that Red Hat intends to include in a subsequent stable version of RHEL, so it can provide community members with a stable ABI/API for development and testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-cases-and-target-users&#34;&gt;Use Cases and Target Users
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream is suitable for CentOS users who want to continue receiving the latest Linux feature updates, as well as developers and partners who wish to participate in Red Hat Enterprise Linux development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also aims to assist community members, Red Hat partners, and others in fully leveraging innovative open-source programs within a more stable and predictable Linux ecosystem&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Customizing Hugo Themes with Modules: An Explanation of Ideas</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hugo-module-custom-theme-ideas/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:01:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hugo-module-custom-theme-ideas/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the historical commit records, the site has switched themes many times. Each time a theme is switched, there are some custom modifications. Here&amp;rsquo;s a record of the思路 for customizing themes. The author’s &lt;code&gt;Github&lt;/code&gt; also has a repository where they briefly maintained the even theme. Later, due to obsessive-compulsive tendencies and a desire to upgrade the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; compiler to the latest version, it became incompatible with the even theme, so they switched back to the &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugos-modularity&#34;&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s modularity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to modularity, people might think of Nginx modules or IDEA plugins, etc. Typically, I can satisfy my differentiated needs by uploading some modules. The reason everyone likes this kind of module is mainly because it&amp;rsquo;s flexible enough and can meet their own needs without too much effort. Because often, although they are generally similar, there are always some differences in the details. This also illustrates the complexity of software, which includes not only technical complexity but also business complexity. In most cases, we face business complexity. This is the best explanation for the saying &amp;ldquo;different industries are like different mountains&amp;rdquo; in the software field. Nowadays, not only the internet industry and financial industry, but even traditional manufacturing has adopted information systems to help with corporate production and management. Even for a leave application system, there will be differences between companies, even within the same industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s modules are a bit different from what people typically think of as modules; they aren’t organized around functionality to meet diverse needs. Instead, they primarily rely on directory structure to identify common structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link to materials: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@sunwei.xyz/07-hugo%E6%9E%B6%E6%9E%84-hugo%E7%9A%84%E6%A8%A1%E5%9D%97-8ef5a520a822&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;07. Hugo Architecture — Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Modules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34;&gt;[[imports]]
path = &amp;quot;github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/v3&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;git submodule&lt;/code&gt; method still works, but this article does not recommend using it. If there are updates to the introduced theme, maintenance will be more complicated, requiring a separate git repository to manage the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modifying-theme-logic&#34;&gt;Modifying Theme Logic
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a foundational understanding of modularity, understanding custom themes becomes much easier. The current themes in &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; are also assembled from multiple different modules; to modify one, simply locate the corresponding template file and make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoted from the &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; official documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this method, there won&amp;rsquo;t be any file under &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; directory. In order to modify the theme, you will have to copy the file you want to modify to the same directory under &lt;code&gt;layouts&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in order to modify the &lt;code&gt;themes/hugo-theme-stack/layouts/partials/head/custom.html&lt;/code&gt; file, you will have to copy it to &lt;code&gt;layouts/partials/head/custom.html&lt;/code&gt; and modify it there (copy the code from theme&amp;rsquo;s repository). The same applies to &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; directories。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-the-template-file&#34;&gt;How to find the template file
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;orthodox-thinking&#34;&gt;Orthodox thinking
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browse the theme&amp;rsquo;s source files, understand the design concept, find the corresponding template file, and make modifications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;brute-force-approach&#34;&gt;Brute force approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not very familiar with front-end code, so sometimes I use a crude approach. For example, I open the corresponding page directly in the browser, find the place I want to modify, locate the &lt;code&gt;css name&lt;/code&gt; using &amp;ldquo;Inspect Element,&amp;rdquo; search for it in the theme source code, find the corresponding file, copy it to the site directory, and then make the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;little-tips&#34;&gt;Little tips
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official default provides a file for customizing styles, and we can split the places that need to be modified into multiple files, introducing our other files through the &lt;code&gt;custom.scss&lt;/code&gt; file, which allows for better management of style files&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-of-revisions-6h&#34;&gt;Summary of revisions (6h)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s already the first year of AI coding. I won’t go into detailed content here, but just briefly list some modifications to this site, such as adjusting the style of the copy button and reconfiguring the code block styles – ChatGPT can easily handle these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall: Global text style, inheriting the display style of the previous &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; merged with &lt;code&gt;info cn&lt;/code&gt;, friendly to Chinese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homepage: Add mouse interaction animation to the right navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homepage: Articles now have abstract previews (implemented with a somewhat expedient method due to the time it took)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll bar: I&amp;rsquo;ve styled the scroll bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code block introduces the &lt;code&gt;highlight.js&lt;/code&gt; code highlighting plugin and beautifies the style of the code blocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article details: Some content is reproduced, with added display of original author information and original link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive page: Remove the theme&amp;rsquo;s color overlay and display the original image for the category picture at the top&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The archive page now features a statistics display panel categorized by year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive page: Two-column layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The component reusability of the &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; theme is high, which also led to significant time consumption when adding summary previews for homepage articles. After modifying the corresponding components, changes occurred on the article details page, resulting in duplicate content being displayed. I&amp;rsquo;m not very familiar with &lt;code&gt;golang template&lt;/code&gt; syntax, so it took a considerable amount of time. I couldn’t resolve parameter passing between components, and ultimately, I used a workaround: introducing a separate &lt;code&gt;JavaScript&lt;/code&gt; script for the homepage and implementing summary previews through custom special variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, excessive code reuse can also be a problem, leading to changes in one area affecting others. Therefore, when modifying the theme, it is important to pay attention and avoid disrupting the original logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;comments-section&#34;&gt;Comments section
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guy&amp;rsquo;s modifications are more complete: [https://blog.reincarnatey.net/2024/0719-better-waline/]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site simply enables the &lt;code&gt;Waline&lt;/code&gt; comment system. The &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; theme natively supports &lt;code&gt;Waline&lt;/code&gt;, just configure it in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

        <title>County-level Brahmin: Big Shots in Small Places</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:02:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, Teacher Da Bing has been very popular on Douyin. You often see accounts posting clips from her livestreams. During one livestream, a listener asked, &amp;ldquo;Teacher Da Bing, I want to sell my house in Xi&amp;rsquo;an and return to my hometown to lie flat?&amp;rdquo; Teacher Da Bing replied, &amp;ldquo;At your age, in your thirties, you can’t just lie flat. Your parents are on the road to aging, and your children haven&amp;rsquo;t settled down yet. Returning to your hometown, you&amp;rsquo;ll still need to deal with the &amp;lsquo;brahmin&amp;rsquo; within a small county town.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether the viewpoint is right or wrong, what does the word &amp;ldquo;Brahmin&amp;rdquo; mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;county-level-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-places&#34;&gt;County-Level Brahmins: &amp;ldquo;Big Shots&amp;rdquo; in Small Places
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many small county towns, people often talk about &amp;ldquo;county Brahmin&amp;rdquo; – their existence seems to symbolize a local society. They are not necessarily real religious figures or possess impressive titles, but rather seemingly ordinary yet influential individuals. They represent “power, status, and the right to speak” in a small place, symbolizing a certain stratum within that county town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-county-level-brahmin&#34;&gt;What is a &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmin&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand that &amp;ldquo;Brahmin&amp;rdquo; originally referred to the highest stratum of Indian society, representing wisdom, authority, and spiritual supremacy. However, in Chinese county towns, the term “county town Brahmin” does not have such a complex religious background; it is more of a metaphor for a social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmin&amp;rdquo; can be understood as some “cultural authorities” in the county town, such as teachers, doctors, local well-known merchants, and officials. Although their positions seem ordinary, they possess a relatively high social status in the comparatively closed environment of the county town, or rather, their opinions and actions have an influence that cannot be ignored locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-the-county-level-brahmin&#34;&gt;Who is the &amp;ldquo;County-Level Brahmin&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the county town, almost every industry has these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins.&amp;rdquo; They might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educators, especially some teachers with decades of experience in local areas, may not be graduates of prestigious universities, but they deeply understand how to establish credibility through knowledge and are widely respected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local government officials: deputy county-level mayors, section-level cadres, and others. They control certain resources and power; even though their positions may not be high, due to the limited scope of their authority, they can become the &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; of the locality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local &amp;ldquo;entrepreneurs&amp;rdquo;: Some of these are bosses in county-level towns, though their scale isn&amp;rsquo;t large, they hold a certain amount of wealth and have local influence. They might run one or two well-known small businesses and wield considerable influence within the town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people, though their status may not be prominent compared to the elites or officials in big cities, are practically equivalent to &amp;ldquo;cultural elders&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;power centers&amp;rdquo; within this small society of the county&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-the-status-of-county-level-brahmins-affect-society&#34;&gt;How does the status of &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; affect society?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the meaning of &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins,&amp;rdquo; we must consider the unique environment of a county. In this place, information doesn&amp;rsquo;t flow as quickly as in big cities, and social mobility is relatively fixed. These “Brahmins” often accumulate prestige, knowledge, and networks through long-term cultivation within the locality. They influence various aspects of local politics, economy, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural influence: In smaller places, especially where the education system may not be so developed and ordinary people have limited choices, local &amp;ldquo;cultural Brahmins&amp;rdquo; quietly shape the cultural atmosphere through knowledge imparted in classrooms, explanations in the media, and even the lessons they teach through their words and deeds in social situations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concentration of social resources: Due to the limited population and resources in county towns, these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; are often one of the main controllers of local resources. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s social welfare, policy implementation, or project approval, their influence is unavoidable. Their right to speak and make decisions allows them to occupy a place in local society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network structure of interpersonal relationships: In a relatively closed small society, personal connections are often crucial. These &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; control the flow of information and allocation of resources by establishing strong social networks, allowing them to play a decisive role at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-metaphor-behind-county-level-brahmin&#34;&gt;The Metaphor Behind &amp;ldquo;County-Level Brahmin&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; are often respected and revered, this &amp;ldquo;high-and-mighty&amp;rdquo; status is not without its problems. In modern society, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see that many &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; in county towns may lack genuine ability and innovative spirit, instead maintaining their position through hereditary relationships and resource monopolies. With the development of informatization, the power of these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; is gradually being broken down, and new social mobility is beginning to impact the appearance of small counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &amp;ldquo;County-Level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; is a fascinating social phenomenon that reflects the power and cultural structures within local societies. Although their “power” may not directly threaten national governance, they are undoubtedly important figures within their localities. In this era of rapid information flow and accelerating social change, these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; in county towns may be facing unprecedented challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It never would have occurred to me to write this piece. I was just curious about what &lt;code&gt;Brahmin&lt;/code&gt; meant, so I tossed it to &lt;code&gt;kimi&lt;/code&gt;, and the result was quite amusing. I could see that the web search had already produced a result, but it instantly changed to display related content unavailable. So I wondered if this word had some special meaning, and then I passed it on to &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt;, which resulted in this article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Slow efficiency when processing large string data in Linux backend services</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-backend-slow-string-processing/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:42:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-backend-slow-string-processing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In C++ development projects, we used a custom protocol for communication that adopted a two-dimensional array pattern. When processing large amounts of data, the protocol needed to traverse and serialize arrays internally to generate logs. Due to low efficiency, this caused noticeable lag in the system under high load, which was reported by the business department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-identification&#34;&gt;Problem identification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When troubleshooting the issue, we first performed a performance analysis of the system and found that the CPU utilization increased significantly when processing large amounts of data, and the system response time lengthened. By analyzing the system logs, we discovered numerous serialization operations, which were inefficient when handling two-dimensional arrays, leading to decreased system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool captured thread information for the service, revealing that the log thread spends most of its time processing string concatenation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the key point for today: different accumulation methods can make a huge difference in efficiency. The historical code uses the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator, which frequently creates temporary objects and is very inefficient. You know it’s inefficient, but you don’t realize just how inefficient it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;demo-verification&#34;&gt;Demo verification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the project code, we extracted the business logic and wrote a simple demo to verify the efficiency of string concatenation. Compile and run with the &lt;code&gt;vs2022&lt;/code&gt; compiler under &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;gcc8.5&lt;/code&gt; compiler under &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt;, in &lt;code&gt;Release&lt;/code&gt; mode, and compare their efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-points-explanation&#34;&gt;Key points explanation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project uses method four. Before receiving the test data, readers can first think about which method is most efficient and which is least efficient? I was still very surprised when I saw the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method 1 (Concatenation using +=): Directly concatenate each field to the string using +=&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method 2 (using &lt;code&gt;std::ostringstream&lt;/code&gt; concatenation): This method uses streams (&lt;code&gt;std::ostringstream&lt;/code&gt;) to concatenate each field, which is more efficient, especially when concatenating large amounts of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method 3 (Pre-allocated Memory with &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt;) involves allocating sufficient memory for the string in advance using &lt;code&gt;reserve&lt;/code&gt;, which reduces the overhead of memory reallocation and improves performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method 4 (&lt;code&gt;bodys = bodys + body + &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;): Creating a new temporary string object with each concatenation leads to performance degradation, especially when concatenating strings on a large scale, because each concatenation involves a new memory allocation and copy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the results, the project selected the least efficient method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take things a step further, let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the optimization efficiency of different platform compilers. Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/code&gt; remains consistently excellent, with very high optimization efficiency for strings, while the &lt;code&gt;GCC&lt;/code&gt; compiler is somewhat lacking in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code runs on different machines, and there is no direct comparison between the two sets of data. You can compare the differences between different concatenation methods separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Lambda expression parameter lifetime in C&#43;&#43;</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-lambda-parameter-lifetime/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:23:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-lambda-parameter-lifetime/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In C++, lambda expressions are convenient anonymous functions that can capture external variables and use them within their bodies. This makes lambdas a flexible programming tool. However, the lifetime of lambda expression parameters is an aspect that requires special attention, especially when capturing and passing parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-lifecycle-of-parameters-in-lambda-expressions&#34;&gt;The lifecycle of parameters in lambda expressions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lifetime of lambda expression parameters is typically the same as that of other C++ functions. Function parameters exist during the function call and end when the function call completes. However, because lambda expressions may capture external variables, the lifetime of the parameters can also be affected by the capturing method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-relationship-between-capture-and-parameter-lifecycle&#34;&gt;The relationship between capture and parameter lifecycle
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;21-capturing-external-variables&#34;&gt;2.1 Capturing External Variables
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;C++ lambda expressions allow capturing external variables in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value capturing: Through value capture, the values of external variables are copied into the lambda, and the lifecycle of these copies is controlled by the lifecycle of the lambda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closure: Through closure capturing, references to external variables are preserved; references within a lambda point to the original external variables, and their lifecycle depends on the external variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;int x = 10;
auto lambda_by_value = [x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };  // 捕获x的副本
auto lambda_by_reference = [&amp;amp;x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };  // 捕获x的引用

lambda_by_value();  // 打印10
lambda_by_reference();  // 打印10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lifecycle of captured variables is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By-value capture: When capturing, the values of external variables are copied into the lambda, and when the lambda&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle ends, these copies are destroyed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture by reference: A lambda holding a reference to an external variable must have the external variable be valid before the lambda is used, otherwise it can lead to undefined behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;22-lambda-parameters&#34;&gt;2.2 Lambda Parameters
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lambda parameters are similar to regular function parameters, their lifecycle is limited to within the lambda function. That is, lambda parameters are created when the lambda is called and their lifecycle ends after the lambda call is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;auto lambda = [](int a, int b) {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; a + b &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
};
lambda(5, 10);  // a和b在这里是lambda的参数
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are parameters of the lambda expression, they are created when the lambda is called and destroyed after the lambda execution ends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lifecycle-issues-when-capturing-external-variables&#34;&gt;Lifecycle issues when capturing external variables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;whether-captured-variables-can-be-valid-outside-of-a-lambda&#34;&gt;Whether captured variables can be valid outside of a lambda
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture by value: Even if external variables are destroyed after a lambda call, the lambda still holds a copy of the external variable. Therefore, the copy inside the lambda can be used safely, even if the external variable no longer exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;int x = 10;
auto lambda = [x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };
x = 20;  // x 在lambda调用后修改
lambda();  // 打印10，捕获的是x的副本
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By reference capture: If a variable is captured by reference, the lambda&amp;rsquo;s access to that reference depends on the lifetime of the external variable. If the external variable is destroyed before the lambda executes, this can lead to a dangling reference and undefined behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;int x = 10;
auto lambda = [&amp;amp;x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };
x = 20;  // x 在lambda调用前修改
lambda();  // 打印20，捕获的是x的引用
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very important to ensure that captured external variables remain valid when the lambda function executes if the order of execution of lambdas is uncertain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

        <title>Win11 Logitech G431 Headphone Driver Installation</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 07:20:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Picking up where we left off, I came back to find that Ghub had been updated, which made me a little happy. The customer service said they fixed the issue of not being able to load problem drivers properly, but after messing around with it for a while – reinstalling and uninstalling – it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t work normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I continued to contact customer service for a solution, but was told that an engineer could provide remote assistance. However, the engineer&amp;rsquo;s working hours were exactly the same as mine, so I had no choice but to give up. I reviewed the materials from the previous troubleshooting and prepared to try installing the driver manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-the-driver-installation-package&#34;&gt;Get the driver installation package
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can I obtain the driver files since Logitech doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a separate driver installation package for their devices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the system image installation package left over from the last system reinstallation, we can reinstall the system in a local virtual machine. In the cleanest system, deploy Ghub separately, insert the headset device into the virtual machine, find the driver path, and copy it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related paths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\ProgramData\LGHUB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\logi_audio.inf_amd64_010b035044e24be4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;device-manager&#34;&gt;Device Manager
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is how to find the second path. Let&amp;rsquo;s first briefly review how to manually manage driver files in Win11 systems. This content was identified using the control variable method, by constantly plugging and unplugging devices and analyzing device information in Device Manager within a virtual machine. We identified that three drivers need to be handled for the headset. Two of these drivers are built-in system drivers, and only one is provided by Logitech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driver Manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second driver in the image is provided by Logitech. We analyze the current device drivers, and search through all driver paths within the virtual machine. Of course, you first need to find files starting with &amp;ldquo;logi,&amp;rdquo; then compare the files. You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to locate the driver file. Copy the entire folder, and you’ve got the driver installation package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driver installation package&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-driver&#34;&gt;Install driver
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still in the Device Manager interface, click: Update Driver, click: Browse My Computer for Drivers, and you will enter the following interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driver Installation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when you open it, you can only see a drive – that&amp;rsquo;s the standard USB drive. Choose &amp;ldquo;Install from disk,&amp;rdquo; and the path is the folder we copied earlier. After installation, a Logitech-specific driver will appear in the drop-down list. Switch the device driver to the newly installed one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disk Installation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anatomy-equipment-drivers&#34;&gt;Anatomy equipment drivers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drivers for this device are provided by the system. You only need to check if there&amp;rsquo;s an exclamation mark in front of the device driver; if there is, go into the driver selection interface and switch to a different type of driver, then change it back to restore normal functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;completed&#34;&gt;Completed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headset microphone volume has returned to normal, and the familiar ear monitoring function is back as well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side sound&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the C drive on my home desktop computer used for development ran out of space. I specially allocated a 256GB SSD that was partially retired for exclusive use by the C drive, but it&amp;rsquo;s been frequently messed with. Since moving to Shanghai, I’ve been busy with various matters, and finally last week I found time to reinstall the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system reinstall went smoothly, and there were no issues with installing everyday software or deploying the development environment. A few days later, I planned to relax and play a few games, when it occurred to me that the drivers for my mouse and headphones hadn&amp;rsquo;t been installed yet. Both devices are Logitech, so I downloaded GHUB software, which automatically recognizes hardware and installs drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an unexpected issue occurred. The mouse driver installed smoothly, but the headset driver kept displaying &amp;ldquo;Loading.&amp;rdquo; I suspect that incompatibility between the latest version of Windows 11 and Logitech&amp;rsquo;s drivers caused the installation to fail. So, I started searching for information and tried to manually install the driver, but the problem remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple explanation of what each of these devices’ drivers do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mouse driver is mainly used to adjust functions such as mouse movement speed. I rarely use macro functions, only needing to restore previously saved parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The driver for the headphones is mainly used for the monitor function, which is very useful during team voice communication as it allows me to hear my own voice. Although there&amp;rsquo;s a similar listening feature in the system’s microphone settings, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work as well as the driver implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite repeated attempts, the drivers for my headphones consistently fail to load. Today, I finally thought to contact customer service to inquire about the situation and see if there was a solution. Customer service told me that their servers have recently been experiencing issues, causing abnormal driver downloads. They are working on this problem and asked me not to worry, saying the issue should be resolved after the next update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the issue with the headphone drivers hasn&amp;rsquo;t been resolved yet, at least we know the cause, and I hope the problem can be fixed as soon as possible&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove interest rate limits on housing loans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting tomorrow, the housing fund interest rate will be lowered by 0.25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The down payment ratio for first-time homebuyers has been lowered to 15%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 billion yuan affordable housing refinancing loans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abolish-the-interest-rate-policy-limits-for-first-time-and-second-time-commercial-personal-housing-loans-at-the-national-level&#34;&gt;Abolish the interest rate policy limits for first-time and second-time commercial personal housing loans at the national level
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Shanghai Head Office, branches in each province, autonomous region, directly-administered municipality and separately planned cities; all state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and all joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, adapt to the new changes in the supply-demand relationship of China’s real estate market and people&amp;rsquo;s new expectations for high-quality housing, and promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, we hereby notify you of the following matters regarding the adjustment of interest rate policies on commercial personal housing loans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. Abolish the interest rate policy limits for first-time and second-time home commercial loans at the national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China’s provincial branches, in accordance with the principle of city-specific policies, will guide each province’s local market interest rate pricing self-discipline mechanism. Based on the real estate market conditions within their jurisdictions and the requirements of local governments, they will independently determine whether to set lower limits for commercial individual housing loan interest rates and the level of those limits (if any).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking and financial institutions should, based on the interest rate lower limits determined by each provincial market interest rate pricing self-discipline mechanism (if any), and combined with their own operating conditions, customer risk profiles, and other factors, reasonably determine the specific interest rate level for each loan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-interest-rate-for-personal-housing-provident-fund-loans-has-been-lowered-by-025-percentage-points&#34;&gt;The interest rate for personal housing provident fund loans has been lowered by 0.25 percentage points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Shanghai Head Office, branches in each province, autonomous region, directly-administered municipality and separately planned cities; policy banks, state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and various joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China has decided that starting May 18, 2024, the interest rates for individual housing provident fund loans will be reduced by 0.25 percentage points. The interest rates for first-time home loans with terms of less than or equal to 5 years and over 5 years will be adjusted to 2.35% and 2.85%, respectively. The interest rates for second-time home loans with terms of less than or equal to 5 years and over 5 years will be adjusted to no lower than 2.775% and 3.325%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-down-payment-ratio-will-be-adjusted-to-no-less-than-15&#34;&gt;The down payment ratio will be adjusted to no less than 15%
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Shanghai Head Office, branches in each province, autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government, and separately planned cities; all regulatory bureaus of the National Financial Regulatory Administration; state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, adapt to the new changes in the supply and demand relationship of China&amp;rsquo;s real estate market, and meet people’s new expectations for high-quality housing, and to promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, we hereby notify you of the following regarding policies on individual home loans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For resident families purchasing commercial residential properties through loans, the minimum down payment ratio for first-home commercial personal housing loans is adjusted to no less than 15%, and the minimum down payment ratio for second-home commercial personal housing loans is adjusted to no less than 25%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, each provincial branch of the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China and each sub-division of the National Financial Regulatory Administration will, in accordance with the requirements of local government regulation and following the principle of city-specific policies, independently determine the lower limit for the first and second home down payment ratio for commercial personal housing loans within their respective jurisdictions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-central-bank-will-establish-a-rmb-300-billion-affordable-housing-refinancing-program&#34;&gt;The central bank will establish a RMB 300 billion affordable housing refinancing program
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 4 p.m., representatives from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, and the National Financial Regulatory Administration gathered at a routine policy briefing held by the State Council to introduce related policies regarding ensuring housing delivery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, Vice Governor of the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Yao Ling announced that the central bank will establish a 300 billion yuan affordable housing refinancing facility to support local state-owned enterprises in acquiring completed but unsold commercial properties at reasonable prices for use as rental or sales-based affordable housing. This is expected to stimulate 500 billion yuan in bank loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the central bank, the term for affordable housing lending is one year, with a possible extension of four times, and an interest rate of 1.75%. It targets 21 nationwide banks, encouraging them to provide loans to local state-owned enterprises selected by municipal governments to acquire completed but unsold commercial properties for use as affordable housing. The acquired commercial properties are strictly limited to those already built and unsold by real estate developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China will soon release a notice on establishing affordable housing refinancing loans regarding this policy&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Art of Balancing Bank Marketing Strategies with Personal Financial Management</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 01:33:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, home renovation projects have significantly increased our daily expenses. We usually use credit cards and pay them off within the billing cycle. Although we have enough cash on hand, we prefer to keep it in money market funds to earn some extra interest income. At the same time, to ensure financial stability, we’ve set up automatic payments so that credit card bills can be paid on time when they are due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-status-deposits-increasing-loans-decreasing&#34;&gt;Bank status: Deposits increasing, loans decreasing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst growing economic uncertainty, people are more inclined to save rather than consume or invest. This leads to an increase in bank deposits but also means banks need to pay higher interest rates to depositors. On the other hand, reduced consumption and investment activities lead to lower loan demand, making it difficult for banks to generate interest income through lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attract and retain customers, banks are forced to offer more competitive deposit rates, which further compresses their net interest margin. At the same time, in order to stimulate economic growth and consumption, the central bank may adopt a policy of lowering benchmark interest rates, which will also affect lending rates and subsequently impact banks&amp;rsquo; profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-marketing-strategies-cultivating-user-habits&#34;&gt;Bank marketing strategies: Cultivating user habits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repayment time is approaching soon. First, Bank of Communications contacted me, offering a one-year installment service with no interest charges. Shortly after that, China Merchants Bank also provided a discount on installment interest at 25%, resulting in an annualized interest rate of just 1.9%. Faced with these offers, I chose to accept the installment services from both banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that banks are truly sparing no effort to cultivate user habits. According to the definition of a bank&amp;rsquo;s clientele, I should be considered a valuable customer. In the current context of difficult loan disbursement for banks, by cultivating my installment mindset, they are essentially preparing for potential future financial difficulties I may encounter, at which point they will be able to earn more interest income from me. After all, it is well known that credit card bill interest rates are not low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks increase credit card usage and build a positive image by offering free installment services and low-interest installment promotions. This shift in strategy demonstrates the bank&amp;rsquo;s rapid response to market changes and deep understanding of customer needs. In this way, banks not only solve the problem of difficult loan disbursement but also lay the groundwork for future profits—&lt;strong&gt;profitability isn’t just about the present; it requires a long-term perspective.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-personal-financial-management&#34;&gt;The importance of personal financial management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although bank installment offers may sound tempting, as users, we should be aware of the risks of over-relying on credit card installments. We should fully consider our repayment ability and future financial needs to avoid falling into long-term debt due to short-term financial convenience. The key to personal financial management lies in balancing current needs with future planning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The multifaceted nature of games: a convergence of psychological development and social entertainment</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 15:07:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, gaming is no longer just a simple form of entertainment but has become an indispensable part of people’s daily lives. From a psychological perspective, games play different roles in the psychological development of people at different ages and are also closely linked to social recreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-state&#34;&gt;Mental state
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games provide young people with a low-cost environment for experimentation and exploration, as they are at a stage of exploring themselves and establishing their identity. Through games, they can try on different roles and lives, satisfying their curiosity and desire to explore. As they get older, however, personal interests and values gradually stabilize, and games may no longer align with their life goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes&#34;&gt;Social attributes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, gaming has become part of social activity, especially for young people. They make friends and build social networks through games; gaming serves as a bridge for socializing. However, as people age, their social circles gradually stabilize, and social needs may be met through other more mature means, diminishing the role of gaming in socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attribute-taking-a-girl-out&#34;&gt;Social attribute: Taking a girl out
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, due to a lack of relationship education, parents often only emphasize studying well during childhood and then immediately push you into dating after graduation—this is a very common phenomenon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of busy studies, work, or a lack of social skills, they haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to establish stable emotional relationships in real life, leading to feelings of loneliness and a desire for attention. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Carrying&amp;rdquo; behavior in games provides an outlet for this longing; by helping and protecting female players, they experience the feeling of being needed and valued, achieving emotional fulfillment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the game&amp;rsquo;s interactive rules are clear and the environment is controllable. Compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real life, games offer a sense of certainty and security, reducing fear of unpredictability in real-world interactions. However, long-term reliance on virtual gratification within games may affect their ability to establish and maintain healthy emotional relationships in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reality-pressure&#34;&gt;Reality pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game provides a virtual world where players can temporarily escape the stress, challenges, or unpleasant emotions of reality. This is especially true for young people facing academic pressure, family problems, or interpersonal relationship challenges; gaming may become a way for them to seek comfort and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are typically designed to give players a sense of accomplishment and recognition when they complete tasks, level up, or defeat opponents. Young people may become addicted to games because they can gain a feeling of being appreciated and recognized in the game, which they may lack in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-getting-older-they-dont-like-playing-anymore&#34;&gt;After getting older, they don&amp;rsquo;t like playing anymore
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young, individuals face relatively fewer social responsibilities and pressures, allowing more time and energy to be devoted to games. As they enter the workforce, start families, and other social responsibilities increase, time and energy become more valuable, and gaming may be seen as a time-consuming activity rather than a preferred leisure choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, their cognitive abilities and interests change. What might appeal to someone in their youth—fast-paced action games with flashy graphics—may later give way to a preference for strategic, story-driven, or deeply engaging games. If the market cannot meet these evolving needs, interest will naturally decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Renminbi exchange rate has experienced significant volatility, breaking through 7.26</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/renminbi-exchange-rate-volatility/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 00:31:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/renminbi-exchange-rate-volatility/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fluctuations in the Renminbi exchange rate and the decline of the broader market may be related to the actions of global central banks, the unexpected interest rate cut by the Swiss National Bank, the performance of US economic data, and adjustments in market expectations regarding inflation and interest rate cuts. These factors collectively impacted the foreign exchange market and stock market, leading to volatility in the Renminbi exchange rate and a decline in A-share markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the content of the link you provided, on March 22, 2024, the exchange rate of the Renminbi experienced a significant fluctuation. Here are the details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US dollar exchange rate against the offshore renminbi broke through: The yuan weakened at the opening of the day, with the dollar versus the offshore renminbi rising above 7.24 to 7.24926 and rising above 7.22 to 7.22360 against the onshore renminbi during intraday trading, both breaking through highs since November 17, 2023. As of the time this reporter from Caiyun Society reported, the dollar versus the offshore renminbi broke through the 7.26 level, falling to a low of 7.2639, and the trend has not stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PBOC Midpoint Adjustment: On March 22, the central bank announced that the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar was set at 7.1004, down 62 basis points, with a larger adjustment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The A-share market reacted with a decline, influenced by various factors; all three major indices opened and closed lower, with falls exceeding 1%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons for Forex Market Volatility: A senior currency trader from an investment firm in Hong Kong stated that forex market volatility is primarily due to the US dollar being boosted by the Swiss National Bank&amp;rsquo;s unexpected interest rate cut, combined with a strong US economy and persistent inflation which may delay interest rate cuts, leading to an increase in the US Dollar Index&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Central Bank Updates:&lt;/strong&gt; This week is a &amp;ldquo;super central bank week&amp;rdquo; for global markets, as central banks in the United States, Japan, the UK, Australia, and many other countries will announce interest rate decisions this week. The Swiss National Bank unexpectedly announced an interest rate cut, becoming the first G10 central bank to do so since the outbreak of the pandemic, which disrupted market equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guangda Bank&amp;rsquo;s Financial Markets Research Department researcher Zhou Maohua stated that, although the renminbi has experienced some fluctuations recently, the overall magnitude is significantly smaller than that of major currencies such as the US dollar. Short-term volatility will not change the year’s trend of a steady and upward trajectory for the renminbi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Storing Custom Objects in Python Dictionaries: The Importance of References and Deep Copies</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/python-dictionary-custom-objects-reference-vs-deepcopy/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 01:08:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/python-dictionary-custom-objects-reference-vs-deepcopy/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Python programming, dictionaries are a very powerful data structure that allows us to associate key-value pairs and efficiently find and manipulate this data. When we try to store custom objects in a dictionary, we often encounter a key concept: object assignment in Python is actually reference assignment, not a deep copy of the object itself. This means that when you put a custom object into a dictionary, the dictionary stores a reference to that object, rather than a brand new copy of the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storing-custom-objects---a-basic-example&#34;&gt;Storing Custom Objects - A Basic Example
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have a simple &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# 创建一个 Person 对象
p1 = Person(&amp;quot;Alice&amp;quot;, 30)

# 将对象存储到字典中
people_dict = {}
people_dict[&amp;quot;alice&amp;quot;] = p1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the &lt;code&gt;people_dict&lt;/code&gt; dictionary now contains an item with the key &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;alice&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and a value that is a reference to the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; type object &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt;. If we modify the attributes of &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;p1.age = 31
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When accessing this object through the dictionary, we will find that its age has also been updated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;print(people_dict[&amp;quot;alice&amp;quot;].age)  # 输出：31
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the dictionary stores not independent copies of &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; objects, but references pointing to the same memory address&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-difference-between-deep-copy-and-shallow-copy&#34;&gt;The difference between deep copy and shallow copy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This referencing behavior can lead to unexpected results when dealing with nested data structures or custom objects. For example, if a custom object contains mutable attributes (such as lists or another custom object), directly storing such an object in a dictionary and modifying it will affect the object retrieved through the dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;class Address:
    def __init__(self, street, city):
        self.street = street
        self.city = city

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age, address):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.address = address

address = Address(&amp;quot;Main St.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Springfield&amp;quot;)
p1 = Person(&amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;, 40, address)
people_dict[&amp;quot;bob&amp;quot;] = p1

# 修改原始地址对象
address.city = &amp;quot;Shelbyville&amp;quot;

# 字典中的人的地址也变了
print(people_dict[&amp;quot;bob&amp;quot;].address.city)  # 输出：Shelbyville
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution: Deep Copy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid problems caused by this shared state, sometimes we need to ensure that the dictionary stores a complete copy of an object, rather than a reference. Python provides the &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; function in the &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; module to achieve this goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import copy

# 使用深拷贝存储对象
people_dict[&amp;quot;bob_deepcopy&amp;quot;] = copy.deepcopy(p1)

# 此时即使修改原始地址对象，深拷贝的对象不会受影响
address.city = &amp;quot;Capital City&amp;quot;
print(people_dict[&amp;quot;bob&amp;quot;].address.city)  # 输出：Capital City
print(people_dict[&amp;quot;bob_deepcopy&amp;quot;].address.city)  # 输出：Shelbyville
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, when using dictionaries to store custom objects in Python, be mindful that object references are stored by default. For situations requiring independent state, use &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; for a deep copy to avoid unexpected data changes due to shared references.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Starch-tube snacks and roadside stalls: The news influence of capital</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/sausages-and-street-vendors-capital-news-influence/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 00:31:58 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;315 did not actually report on the chicken bone gelatin issue; this problem itself is confusing the CCTV 3·15 Gala’s official exposure with other food safety hotspots that occurred at the same time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;journalism&#34;&gt;Journalism
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 315 Gala listed nine manufacturers, but none of them produced sausage. Now, the nominated brands have lost all their buzz, while this focus on &amp;ldquo;tang mian chang&amp;rdquo; (starch sausage) – a popular snack found everywhere and likely the most common one – feels like it&amp;rsquo;s being unfairly targeted. I traced the news source to a CCTV report published on 3.15 investigating ham sausages, but it only listed ingredients from several manufacturers without finding any issues. Then, this reporter claimed, through an employee of a factory, that chicken bone meal was sometimes used as a substitute for chicken – essentially hearsay. She then asked pet food stores selling chicken bone meal on Taobao if it&amp;rsquo;s safe for human consumption. Isn’t that ridiculous? Would a pet food vendor actually recommend people eat it? Subsequently, rumors spread claiming starch sausage contained chicken bone meal, which is unsafe for humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current situation is likely causing many factories to close down, and hundreds of thousands of small vendors across the country are facing a predicament where they can&amp;rsquo;t sell their goods and have no business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reality-of-the-human-world&#34;&gt;Reality of the human world
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a report by the Xiaoxiang Morning News on March 17th, on March 16th in Sanmenxia, Henan, the day after the “starch-paste sausage collapse incident,” a woman set up her stall to sell starch-paste sausages. However, two hours passed without any customers, and she eventually quietly ate the sausages herself. The person who filmed the scene said that he used to be able to eat four or five starch-paste sausages at a time, but after learning about the chicken bone powder inside, he resolutely stopped eating them. That day, curious to see if anyone would still buy starch-paste sausages after the exposure, he witnessed the vendor selling not a single one in two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auntie has no idea about this tapioca sausage incident; she just knows that suddenly, nobody is buying her grilled sausages today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old woman isn&amp;rsquo;t wrong; she’s just trying to feed her family. The old woman doesn&amp;rsquo;t even know if the product has problems or is qualified, nor does she know what bone glue is. They don&amp;rsquo;t understand the internet; they are simply people at the bottom trying to find a way to survive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The starch sausage collapsed, but those paying the bill are individual grassroots vendors. It&amp;rsquo;s a painful process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;regulatory-failure&#34;&gt;Regulatory failure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, one afternoon, a colleague of mine who had come from out of town and I went to lunch, passing by a stall selling grilled sausages and stir-fried beef&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blurted out, &amp;ldquo;Do people still eat black technology sausages and sirloin like this?&amp;rdquo; Because in my mind, the last time I ate a starch sausage was probably about fifteen years ago&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague hesitated for a moment, then said tactfully, &amp;ldquo;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because you live in a big city. In our hometown, a small place like that, pickled vegetables, instant noodles, and sausage are part of everyday life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in school, my dad would only let me have a grilled sausage if I got a perfect score on my test. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t because they were unhygienic; it’s just that a grilled sausage cost 1.5 yuan—enough to buy two jin of vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard the idea of calling instant noodles, carbonated drinks, and spicy-flavored fish snacks &amp;ldquo;junk food&amp;rdquo; after I started studying in Beijing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized the arrogance in my careless words just now and remained silent. But this incident left a deep impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this is the daily life of most ordinary people in China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lives lacked the sophisticated &amp;ldquo;Mediterranean diet,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;green organic vegetables,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;non-GMO soybeans.&amp;rdquo; They only cared about whether they could buy some cheap yet delicious vegetables, meat, and snacks, allowing the whole family to enjoy their few moments of happiness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the items on the shelves, what are they made of, whether they will poison their health, and if there are any peculiar chemical ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was never something they should care about or understand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They simply believed that if there were any problems, someone would take care of it and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t appear on the shelves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after watching the 315 gala, everyone realized that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronic scales in markets and gas pumps at gas stations can be fitted with high-tech modified motherboards, requiring content creators to risk being assaulted while filming videos so that regulators can finally realize the issue and take action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cured pork with pickled plums in live-streaming rooms and the powdered sausage sold at street stalls were actually made from rotten meat and bone powder. It took CCTV reporters to go undercover and film footage before anyone would verify it or investigate the source and origin of the goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;health tonic wine&amp;rdquo; heavily promoted on TV channels and airport advertisements needed someone to release a video exposing its secrets before it was suddenly removed overnight and disappeared from public view&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is once a year&amp;rsquo;s 315 enough to drop five or six products that have been selling for a long time, just like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who else would they turn to after already having eaten and bought from them?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Why is the speed test result only 100 Mbps for a newly installed Gigabit fiber connection?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/new-gigabit-fiber-slow-speed/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Want your home network to be as fast as lightning? The key lies in understanding the choice of network cables, configuring the optical network terminal and router, and those seemingly insignificant details. This blog will guide you through how to build a Gigabit network with Cat6 Ethernet cable and how to ensure your network speed is not limited by simple device checks and configurations. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore together and make your home internet fly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manual Repair&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-in-depth-analysis-of-network-transmission-media&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: In-Depth Analysis of Network Transmission Media
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we talk about achieving gigabit network access, the carrier of information at high speed – the network cable – plays a crucial role. The following will provide a detailed explanation of Cat 5, Cat 6, and Cat 7 cables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cat-5-network-cable&#34;&gt;Cat 5 network cable
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Category 5 network cables, also known as CAT5, are an early type of twisted-pair cable that uses a precise spiral structure design to reduce crosstalk. It is mainly used for 10/100Mbps fast Ethernet, with a maximum transmission frequency of approximately 100MHz. Although widely used in the past, Category 5 network cables cannot meet current requirements for gigabit and higher speeds due to physical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;six-category-ethernet-cable-cat6&#34;&gt;Six-Category Ethernet Cable (CAT6)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the development of technology, Cat6 cabling emerged. Compared to Cat5 cabling, Cat6 cables adopted stricter manufacturing standards and more advanced structural designs, significantly improving anti-interference capabilities and transmission efficiency. They can support a transmission rate of up to 1Gbps and, under ideal conditions, achieve a transmission distance of 100 meters – perfectly meeting the access requirements of Gigabit networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;seven-category-ethernet-cable-cat7&#34;&gt;Seven-Category Ethernet Cable (CAT7)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven categories of network cable represent the pinnacle of current twisted-pair technology. It not only boasts a significant improvement in transmission rate, theoretically supporting up to 10Gbps of ultra-high speed, but also incorporates a complete shielding system in its design, including shielding between each pair of wires and overall outer layer shielding, thereby greatly reducing external electromagnetic interference and near-end crosstalk, ensuring the stability and accuracy of data transmission. However, seven categories of network cable is mainly used for future 10 Gigabit Ethernet or specific high-demand scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building a Gigabit home network, choosing Cat6 cabling is the most economical and efficient option to fully unleash the potential of the Gigabit fiber. Ensuring that all connecting cables are of qualified quality and strictly following standard wiring practices is also an important link in ensuring network performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-delving-into-network-core-devicesthe-impact-of-optical-network-terminal-ont-and-router-lan-port-bandwidth&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: Delving into Network Core Devices—The Impact of Optical Network Terminal (ONT) and Router LAN Port Bandwidth
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-importance-of-the-optical-network-terminal-and-its-lan-port-bandwidth&#34;&gt;The importance of the optical network terminal and its LAN port bandwidth
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Optical Network Terminal (ONT), also known as an optical modem, is the core device for home broadband access. Its function is to convert the light signal from fiber into a digital signal for use by home network devices. For users with gigabit fiber connections, whether the ONT supports gigabit transmission is particularly important. If the ONT&amp;rsquo;s WAN port only supports 100Mbps, even if the fiber-to-the-home rate is higher, it will be limited to within 100Mbps due to this bottleneck. Similarly, the ONT’s LAN port also needs to have gigabit output capabilities; otherwise, routers or other devices connected to it cannot achieve true gigabit speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-role-of-bandwidth-for-the-lan-ports-on-a-router&#34;&gt;The role of bandwidth for the LAN ports on a router
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The router&amp;rsquo;s LAN port is responsible for distributing received data to various terminal devices. When the router’s LAN port is limited to gigabit speed, even if other equipment is well-configured, it can only achieve gigabit network communication. Therefore, when building a Gigabit home network, ensure that the router’s WAN port can receive Gigabit data and that the LAN port can also provide Gigabit-level output capabilities so that all smart devices in your home can enjoy the smooth experience brought by high-speed networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, it is important to note that some older or low-end routers may have an auto-negotiation mechanism for the LAN port rate. This means that even if the router itself supports gigabit speeds, it may downgrade to 100Mbps mode due to factors such as cabling and device compatibility. Therefore, correctly configuring the router parameters, enabling forced gigabit mode, and using a gigabit switch or direct connection are key steps in achieving an all-gigabit network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After upgrading to Gigabit fiber, be sure to check and replace your Optical Network Terminal (ONT) and router with Gigabit devices, ensuring that all device interfaces meet the Gigabit standard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-the-mystery-of-latency--how-a-broken-thread-can-affect-gigabit-network-speed&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: The Mystery of Latency – How a Broken Thread Can Affect Gigabit Network Speed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;subnet-cable-failure-and-network-performance-degradation&#34;&gt;Subnet cable failure and network performance degradation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network remained connected throughout the speed test, with no obvious disconnections. As it&amp;rsquo;s a newly installed broadband connection, the wiring closet is quite cluttered, and I occasionally adjust the fiber modem’s cabling and power outlet location, which has resulted in speeds reaching gigabit on rare occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the previous information, we analyzed and ruled out various factors such as network cable model and optical modem LAN port speed, ultimately discovering that the culprit was a broken brown internal wire within the network cable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for the disconnection: When the technician installed the crystal head, they pulled on this network cable a little too hard, causing one of the wires to break in half. It didn&amp;rsquo;t completely disconnect at the time, but subsequent adjustments to the optical modem’s position and repeated movement caused it to finally break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-of-the-functions-of-eight-wires-in-six-categories-of-network-cables&#34;&gt;Analysis of the Functions of Eight Wires in Six Categories of Network Cables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six categories of network cables follow the TIA/EIA-568-B standard, consisting of eight twisted pairs with the following color coding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Orange / Orange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White and green / Green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White and blue / Blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tan / Brown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-T) standard, four pairs of wires within these eight lines work simultaneously, with the following specific functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The white-orange and orange pair of wires (1 &amp;amp; 2) are used for sending data (Tx+/–)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The white-green and green-green pair of wires (3 &amp;amp; 6) are used for receiving data (Rx+/-);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The white-blue and blue pair (4&amp;amp;5) as well as the white-brown and brown pair (7&amp;amp;8) are not originally designated for use in Gigabit Ethernet, but may be enabled in certain advanced applications (such as partial PoE power supply or future technology extensions). In traditional 100Mbps networks, only the four wires 1, 2, 3, and 6 are actually needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-impact-of-broken-chains-on-network-speed&#34;&gt;The impact of broken chains on network speed
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above situation, if a brown sub-line (brown or brown-white wire) is broken, it will theoretically cause a speed reduction in a Gigabit network environment because a Gigabit network requires all four pairs of wires to transmit bidirectionally at full speed. However, due to the automatic negotiation function often found in home network devices, when a cable problem is detected, it will revert to a lower rate mode that can operate normally, which is 100Mbps mode. This explains why even with one sub-line broken, the network can remain connected and operate at 100Mbps speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, while a broken brown fiber strand does not affect the basic operation of a 100-megabit network, it can be a key factor limiting network speed in a gigabit environment. Only through thorough diagnosis and repair can the full potential of the gigabit fiber optic cable be realized. This also reminds us that when encountering similar situations, we should not overlook any potential network infrastructure issues, even seemingly minor faults that do not affect basic connectivity, as they may become hidden obstacles to high-speed network experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>UI thread issues and solutions in WPF</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wpf-ui-thread-and-freezing-issues-solutions/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 07:12:21 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wpf-ui-thread-and-freezing-issues-solutions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When developing desktop applications, especially when building rich client applications using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework, correctly handling the user interface (UI) thread is crucial for ensuring application smoothness and responsiveness. The UI thread, also known as the main thread, is the core thread responsible for processing window and control events, layout calculations, and rendering the interface. Any operation that interacts with UI elements should be executed on the UI thread; this is a fundamental principle followed by WPF and most other GUI frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-ui-thread&#34;&gt;What is the UI thread?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UI thread is created and initialized by the operating system when a WPF application starts, and it initializes the application&amp;rsquo;s main window. It’s the only thread that can directly access and modify the state of UI components in the application. This means all user interactions, such as button clicks, text box input, and window resizing, are handled within this thread&amp;rsquo;s context. Simultaneously, WPF&amp;rsquo;s dependency property system, data binding mechanism, and layout logic also execute synchronously on the UI thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stuttering-phenomenon-and-its-causes&#34;&gt;Stuttering phenomenon and its causes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the UI thread is occupied or blocked for an extended period, such as when performing time-consuming calculations, loading large amounts of data, querying databases, or other I/O-intensive tasks, it can prevent the UI thread from responding to user interactions in a timely manner, resulting in a frozen interface (Freeze), which we commonly refer to as &amp;ldquo;lag.&amp;rdquo; In this situation, users will noticeably feel the application&amp;rsquo;s delay and sluggishness, and severe cases may even trigger an “Application Not Responding” (ANR) warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-two-basic-rules-of-the-ui-thread&#34;&gt;The two basic rules of the UI thread
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid these situations, WPF developers should follow these two key rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid performing time-consuming operations on the UI thread. Any operation that may cause the UI thread to freeze should be moved to a background thread as much as possible to ensure that the UI thread can respond to user input and render screen changes in a timely manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not directly update UI elements on non-UI threads. Due to the security mechanism design of WPF, only the UI thread is authorized to modify UI elements. Attempting to change the UI state directly from another thread will throw an exception. Therefore, even if a background thread has completed calculations or data preparation, it needs to display the results on the UI through appropriate cross-thread communication mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution-asynchronous-programming-and-thread-safe-updates&#34;&gt;Solution: Asynchronous Programming and Thread-Safe Updates
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maintain a smooth UI while executing time-consuming tasks, WPF provides various asynchronous programming models and tools to help developers achieve this goal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dispatcher object: The WPF Dispatcher class allows you to schedule work items for execution in the UI thread&amp;rsquo;s task queue. You can safely update the UI from background threads using the &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher.Invoke&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher.BeginInvoke&lt;/code&gt; methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt; keywords allow you to write asynchronous methods and use the &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keyword to wait for background tasks to complete, automatically returning to the UI thread to execute subsequent UI update code upon completion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-study&#34;&gt;Case study
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-the-dispatcherinvoke-method-to-update-the-ui&#34;&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher.Invoke&lt;/code&gt; method to update the UI
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    // 假设这是一个耗时操作
    Task.Run(() =&amp;gt;
    {
        var result = LongRunningOperation(); // 这里是模拟一个耗时计算的方法
        
        // 当耗时操作完成后，在UI线程上更新UI
        Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(() =&amp;gt;
        {
            LabelStatus.Text = $&amp;quot;计算结果: {result}&amp;quot;;
        });
    });
}

private string LongRunningOperation()
{
    // 模拟耗时操作
    Thread.Sleep(5000);
    return &amp;quot;已完成&amp;quot;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-asyncawait-keywords-with-taskrun&#34;&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt; keywords with &lt;code&gt;Task.Run&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;private async void Button_ClickAsync(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    Button button = sender as Button;
    button.IsEnabled = false; // 防止用户重复点击

    try
    {
        // 开启后台任务
        var result = await Task.Run(() =&amp;gt; LongRunningOperation());

        // 在后台任务完成后，自动切换回UI线程更新UI
        LabelStatus.Text = $&amp;quot;计算结果: {result}&amp;quot;;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        MessageBox.Show($&amp;quot;发生错误: {ex.Message}&amp;quot;);
    }
    finally
    {
        button.IsEnabled = true; // 重新启用按钮
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Upgrading GCC version leads to program crashes: Hidden dangers of non-compliant code</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/upgrade-gcc-version-causes-program-crash-code-irregularities/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 23:19:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/upgrade-gcc-version-causes-program-crash-code-irregularities/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the same business code segment, the program compiled and ran normally in the CentOS 7 environment, but when switched to CentOS 8 and compiled with an updated version of GCC, it crashed. It is worth noting that the problem only occurred in &lt;strong&gt;Release mode&lt;/strong&gt;, there were no issues at all in &lt;strong&gt;Debug mode&lt;/strong&gt;. This was the first time we encountered a situation like this, and after three days of troubleshooting, we finally found the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;problem-identification&#34;&gt;Problem identification
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some troubleshooting, the root cause of the problem is that &lt;strong&gt;the function lacks a return value&lt;/strong&gt;. In Release mode, newer versions of GCC perform more optimizations, which leads to undefined behavior in functions that originally lacked explicit return values during execution, resulting in crashes. Our conclusion is that &lt;strong&gt;compiler warnings should not be ignored, especially in older projects where some warnings may have been overlooked; however, we should avoid suppressing all warnings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;environmental-description&#34;&gt;Environmental Description
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentOS 7 GCC version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-39)
Copyright © 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentOS 8 GCC version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;gcc (GCC) 8.5.0 20210514 (Red Hat 8.5.0-21)
Copyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crash-phenomenon&#34;&gt;Crash phenomenon
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When analyzing the crash stack of the program, we observed the following stack information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;[New LWP 1385902]
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library &amp;quot;/lib64/libthread_db.so.1&amp;quot;.
Core was generated by `./pstack_main`.
Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x00007ffe894b4420 in ?? ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007ffe894b4420 in ?? ()
#1  0x00000000004008e9 in main ()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stack looks far from intuitive; the crash function&amp;rsquo;s stack information is displayed as a &lt;code&gt;??&lt;/code&gt;, which makes troubleshooting even more complicated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;code-example&#34;&gt;Code example
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the issue, here&amp;rsquo;s a minimal code example to reproduce the crash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;map&amp;gt;

int test() {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
}

int main() {
    test();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function in this code apparently does not explicitly return a value, while its return type is declared as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. According to the C++ specification, when a function is declared as type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, it must have a return value; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compilation-warning&#34;&gt;Compilation warning
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our project, CMake scripts have suppressed many compile-time warnings, including the following warning message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;/root/pstack/main.cpp: In function ‘int test()’:
/root/pstack/main.cpp:7:1: warning: no return statement in function returning non-void [-Wreturn-type]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This warning indicates that the &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function does not return a value, which is the root of the problem. High versions of GCC (such as 8.5.0) may make unstable optimizations when optimizing code due to this undefined behavior, leading to program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;assembly-code-differences&#34;&gt;Assembly code differences
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain the differences in GCC compiler optimization behavior, we compared the assembly code generated by different versions of GCC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assembly code generated by GCC 4.8.5:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assembly code is relatively verbose and includes handling logic for the standard output stream (such as &lt;code&gt;std::cout&lt;/code&gt;). This indicates that the compiler performed more conservative optimizations, did not extensively optimize the missing return value issue in the &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function, possibly to avoid crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assembly code generated by GCC 8.5.0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version of GCC has undergone more optimizations, reducing code volume. However, this optimization may cause undefined behavior when functions lacking return values are executed, potentially leading to program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this issue investigation, we deeply realized that in C++, &lt;strong&gt;function return values must be explicit&lt;/strong&gt;, especially when a function is declared as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, it must provide a return value. Projects using older compilers may encounter more optimizations and stricter warning mechanisms when upgrading to newer versions of GCC. Therefore, we recommend against suppressing all warnings during compilation; instead, they should be handled selectively, particularly common issues such as function return values and type matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the issue was resolved by adding a return value to the &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function, and the program returned to normal operation&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>VMware virtual machine CPU resource usage anomaly</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-machine-cpu-resource-usage-anomaly/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The background is that the locally deployed Windows version of the business system occupies about 5% of CPU resources. The Linux version of the business system deployed in VMware-installed CentOS8 has abnormal resource occupancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-description&#34;&gt;Problem description
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host machine: Windows 10 Enterprise Edition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vmware：17.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual machine: CentOS 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual machine resources are allocated as &lt;code&gt;4C8GB&lt;/code&gt;, and the business system is started. The business system is deployed in a virtual machine Linux environment. Inside the virtual machine, the top command observes system resource usage, and CPU utilization is not high. However, in the outer Windows system, Task Manager shows very high CPU resource utilization. Checking processes reveals that the VMware process consumes a lot of CPU resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;+

+&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;+&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-points&#34;&gt;Key points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting this issue has not been smooth, as the root cause wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the business system itself but rather a problem with the virtual machine. How to shift focus from routine business code to system load, then from anomalies in load data to soft interrupts, and finally pinpoint the key factor: what could affect the efficiency of VMware soft interrupts? This article will first explain the relevant knowledge points and then provide a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hyper-v&#34;&gt;hyper-v
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtualization technology for Windows operating systems has undergone a significant change. When Microsoft first released WSL, enabling the Hyper-V service would prevent the simultaneous use of VMware virtual machines. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until subsequent versions that VMware became compatible with the Hyper-V service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;system-load&#34;&gt;System load
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Linux system, &amp;ldquo;load&amp;rdquo; refers to the number of processes that are running or waiting to be executed in the system. Load is typically represented by three numbers, which represent the average number of processes in the run queue over 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes. These numbers can be viewed by running the &amp;ldquo;uptime&amp;rdquo; command or the &amp;ldquo;top&amp;rdquo; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, these three numbers represent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average number of processes in the run queue over the past 1 minute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average number of processes in the run queue over the past 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average number of processes in the run queue over the past 15 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of load is the number of processes waiting to run in the system. If this number exceeds the logical CPU count of the system, it indicates a high system load, meaning that many processes are waiting for processor resources. This can lead to the system becoming slow or unresponsive, depending on the degree of the load and the system&amp;rsquo;s configuration and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the load should be maintained within the logical CPU count of the system to optimize performance. If the load consistently exceeds the number of CPUs, further analysis of processes in the system may be necessary to identify the cause of the high load and take appropriate measures to adjust system resource allocation or optimize process execution methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analyzing-load-with-mpstat&#34;&gt;Analyzing load with mpstat
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; command is used to report multiple pieces of information for single or multiple processors, including average load, CPU utilization, interrupts, and context switching. As a useful tool in the &lt;code&gt;sysstat&lt;/code&gt; package, &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; can be used to analyze system load conditions. The following are the steps for using &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; to perform load analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing sysstat
If &lt;code&gt;sysstat&lt;/code&gt; is not installed on your system, you can use a package management tool suitable for your system to install it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run mpstat
Use the &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; command to view CPU usage and load. By default, &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; displays the average CPU usage every second. You can adjust the output frequency by specifying a time interval. For example, to run &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; once per second, you can use the following command: &lt;code&gt;mpstat -P ALL 2&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; indicates resource occupancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;01:32:33 PM  CPU    %usr   %nice    %sys %iowait    %irq   %soft  %steal  %guest  %gnice   %idle
01:32:35 PM  all    0.00    0.00    0.26    0.00    3.73    0.26    0.00    0.00    0.00   95.76
01:32:35 PM    0    0.00    0.00    0.51    0.00    3.57    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00   95.92
01:32:35 PM    1    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    3.59    0.51    0.00    0.00    0.00   95.90
01:32:35 PM    2    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    4.15    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00   95.85
01:32:35 PM    3    0.00    0.00    0.52    0.00    3.61    0.52    0.00    0.00    0.00   95.36
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis output
The output of &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; includes the utilization rate for each CPU and the system&amp;rsquo;s average load. Paying particular attention to the average load and the utilization rate of each CPU can help you understand the system’s load situation. If the load is high, further analysis can identify which processes are causing it and whether there are any performance bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining with other tools
In addition to &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt;, tools such as &lt;code&gt;sar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pidstat&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;iostat&lt;/code&gt; can also be used for comprehensive system performance analysis. By combining the output of multiple tools, you can gain a more complete understanding of system load and identify the root causes of performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interruption&#34;&gt;Interruption
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t elaborate on the content here
Recommended: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.codedump.info/post/20200522-sgfap-softirq/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;System Guide for Application Developers - CPU Part on Soft Interrupts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequent triggering of soft interrupts will also be reflected in system load&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that analyzing the problem solely from a CPU perspective is unable to pinpoint the issue, should we start suspecting an anomaly in the system? It&amp;rsquo;s possible that the Linux operating system has an excessively high load, leading VMware to consume excessive CPU resources. By using &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; to analyze the local virtual machine, we found abnormal &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; usage, approaching 25% on a single core. Under normal circumstances, when running business processes without any load, the &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; percentage should be around 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the development environment of his team, CentOS 7 is deployed on VMware and resource usage appears normal. On the other hand, in the Shanghai development environment, although it&amp;rsquo;s also VMware, we cannot directly observe the CPU resources of the host machine. We are now facing multiple variables: the VMware virtual machine, the Linux operating system, and the GCC version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning to analyze the test environment, Shenzhen&amp;rsquo;s test environment is deployed on physical machines and runs a low-version GCC compilation service, and it operates on CentOS 8. Interestingly, in the Shenzhen environment, &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; occupancy is normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate issues introduced by GCC versions, we deployed programs compiled with a newer version of GCC to the Shenzhen environment for testing, and the results were also normal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue seems to be becoming clearer, and we&amp;rsquo;ve started to suspect there might be a problem with the operating system. After all, CentOS 8 is no longer officially supported. But even after redeploying clean installations of both CentOS 7 and CentOS 8, the problem persists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we began to suspect the only remaining uncertainty: VMware virtualization software. Suddenly, an idea struck us – Hyper-V technology. Could Hyper-V have been enabled previously but not completely shut down, leading to this issue? After all, soft interrupts are also implemented through virtualization software. Are there bugs in different virtualization technologies? These questions warrant further thought and investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Microsoft official manual, we completely shut down the local Hyper-V service and found that VMware recovered normally on the host machine. With this, the problem was finally resolved. As mentioned earlier, this experience was tortuous and arduous, requiring comprehensive analysis and judgment. This was also the first time we troubleshooted the issue and located it at the virtual machine level.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Traps in C&#43;&#43; Programming: Detailed Explanation of Program Crashes Caused by Misusing `std::map`</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-programming-traps-std-map-crash-details/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 22:03:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-programming-traps-std-map-crash-details/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This article aims to reveal the potential for program crashes when &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt; containers are incorrectly used in C++ programming. Attempting to access a non-existent key through the bracket operator automatically adds an empty element. We will delve into this misunderstanding and demonstrate its potential risks with example code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing simple values is fine, but if you&amp;rsquo;re storing pointers, there will be problems. Because a pointer is an address, and if it’s not initialized, the address is uncertain, which can lead to program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the C++ standard library, &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt; is an associative container that stores elements in ascending order based on their keys (key) and provides efficient keyword lookup functionality. However, novice developers sometimes encounter difficulties due to a misunderstanding of the behavior of the &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt; bracket operator &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, when using &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; to access a non-existent key, &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt; will insert a new key-value pair, and the default constructor will be used to initialize the value type corresponding to that key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;map&amp;gt;

int main() {
    std::map&amp;lt;std::string, int&amp;gt; myMap;
    
    // 错误的用法：假设这里试图访问一个不存在的键并认为会得到0
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Value for &#39;nonexistent_key&#39;: &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; myMap[&amp;quot;nonexistent_key&amp;quot;] &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

    // 实际上，上述行代码创建了一个新的键值对，其中值被默认初始化为int的默认值（通常是0）
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the above code does not directly cause the program to crash, this implicit insertion behavior can potentially lead to unexpected side effects in certain situations, such as resource leaks or state changes that do not meet expectations. Worse still, concurrent access to uninitialized memory regions in a multithreaded environment can even lead to program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent such issues, it is recommended to use the &lt;code&gt;std::map::find()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;std::map::count()&lt;/code&gt; methods to check if a key exists, or to explicitly insert elements using &lt;code&gt;std::map::insert()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;std::map&amp;lt;std::string, int&amp;gt; safeMap;
if (safeMap.count(&amp;quot;nonexistent_key&amp;quot;) == 0) {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Key does not exist.&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Value for existing key: &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; safeMap[&amp;quot;nonexistent_key&amp;quot;] &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
}

// 或者明确插入一个键值对，指定初始值
safeMap.insert({ &amp;quot;new_key&amp;quot;, 0 });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the objects stored within a map container are of pointer type, the automatic insertion behavior will save an uninitialized pointer, and any operation on this pointer will lead to program crashes&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Troubleshooting process freezing with pstack</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/pstack-troubleshooting-process-hang/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 23:55:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/pstack-troubleshooting-process-hang/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In software development and operations, you often encounter situations where processes appear to be frozen. This can lead to system performance degradation or service unavailability. This article introduces how to use the pstack tool to troubleshoot these frozen process issues by analyzing the process&amp;rsquo;s stack information to identify the cause of the problem and resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: A subsystem of the risk control system experienced a freeze, rendering the risk control service unavailable. Due to the lack of service availability monitoring, the frozen process was not detected in time, leading to system unavailability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hung process refers to a state where the process stops responding but does not exit. This situation can be caused by various factors, such as deadlock, resource exhaustion, or exceptions. To resolve these issues, we can use the pstack tool to analyze the process&amp;rsquo;s stack information and identify the root cause of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps&#34;&gt;Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;pstack is a commonly used tool, typically provided with gdb (the GNU debugger). You can install it using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get install gdb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain the process ID: First, we need to get the process ID (PID) of the frozen process. You can use the &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; command to list all processes and find the process ID that needs troubleshooting.
Use the pstack tool to analyze process stacks; once you obtain the process ID, you can use the pstack tool to retrieve the stack information for that process. Run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;pstack &amp;lt;PID&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will output the process&amp;rsquo;s stack information, displaying the current sequence of function calls. By analyzing this information, you can identify where the process is stalled and thus locate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing stack information can help identify the cause of a process freeze. You might discover deadlocks, infinite loops, or other anomalies. Take appropriate measures based on the specific situation, such as releasing locks or fixing code logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-study&#34;&gt;Case study
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simple demo, after the main function starts, creates a child thread that enters a dead loop when executing the actual function, causing the program to fail to end normally and fall into a frozen state&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0.0)
project(pstack_main VERSION 0.1.0 LANGUAGES C CXX)

include(CTest)
enable_testing()

# 查找线程库
find_package(Threads REQUIRED)

add_executable(pstack_main main.cpp)

# 链接线程库
target_link_libraries(pstack_main PRIVATE Threads::Threads)

set(CPACK_PROJECT_NAME ${PROJECT_NAME})
set(CPACK_PROJECT_VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION})
include(CPack)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;thread&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;chrono&amp;gt;

void infiniteLoop() {
    while (true) {
        // 主线程进入死循环
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread thread(infiniteLoop); // 创建一个线程，执行死循环函数
    thread.join(); // 等待线程结束
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting the program, execution of pstack results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;Thread 2 (Thread 0x7eff3619b700 (LWP 1315017)):

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be seen that the reason for the process freeze is a dead loop. The main thread enters a dead loop, and the child thread cannot exit, leading to the process freezing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If I had followed my family&amp;rsquo;s plans and diligently studied electrical engineering without venturing into coding, I probably would have been a typical obedient son&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaking off the dust of memories, it all started with a conversation with my roommate near Chinese New Year, and I took the opportunity to reflect on these past years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-one&#34;&gt;Chapter One
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gaokao results weren&amp;rsquo;t particularly good or bad. I graduated from a 211 university, and according to my dad’s original plan, I should have studied power grids diligently and returned to work at the local power supply bureau in our hometown. As mentioned earlier, I forgot to mention one key aspect of how I ended up on the IT path: my views on money and self-discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still in a rural school in the first year of junior high, my family arranged for me to transfer to a city school by the second year. It felt like Liu姥姥 visiting the Grand View Garden—I had trouble adjusting to the bustle of the city. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone to the cinema many times as a child, and certainly not with my parents; relatives did take me occasionally. Luckily, I made friends with several like-minded guys. Though we don’t keep in touch much now, that time of youth looks back fondly. After weekend tutoring, we would collect plastic bottles from the classroom, expertly crushing them with our feet before packing them into backpacks to bring home for my mom to save. Once we had enough, we&amp;rsquo;d find someone who collected recyclables to take care of them. We played chess, badminton, and Dou Di Zhu (a card game), and the losers would do push-ups as punishment. I was a little grateful then that my dad had been getting me to do various exercises since I was young. From this point on, my view of money became slightly skewed, and I felt a bit insecure. But these small misfortunes were fleeting. My family wasn’t wealthy; we didn&amp;rsquo;t have much pocket money, and sometimes I couldn’t play with the other students, especially on weekends. My parents’ efforts were visible to the naked eye as we moved from the village to the city. The seeds had been planted, waiting to sprout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone not particularly bright, I was generally very happy during my time studying. Just like many people don&amp;rsquo;t realize until after they graduate, studying isn’t that difficult; the conversion between input and output is relatively easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layering memories of the imperial era from childhood, and then encountering a laptop during university was like opening Pandora&amp;rsquo;s Box. I came into contact with games and formed connections with game merchants. Initially, I was a low-level salesperson, purchasing goods upstream and slowly selling them through my own network to make a little money. Gradually, I understood the entire chain’s operational logic. The goods we sold were nothing more than those batch-incubated by upstream programs, their costs approaching zero. At this point, things started going slightly off track. Within my major, there were specialized subfields – on one side was power grids, and on the other, automation (a very diverse field including chip programming and factory electrical automation). I realized that programs could make a lot of money, not just a little, and upstream channels indeed earned a great deal. Coupled with my existing programming background, I started dabbling here and there, making some small sums of money. When choosing a specialization, it naturally led me to automation. I skipped many of the required courses in my junior year, my mind constantly focused on writing code to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article last year mentioned that, driven by a romanticized view of hackers and with the kindness of IT experience outside of formal education, I dabbled in assembly, penetration testing, game hacks, DLL hijacking, and account theft, becoming familiar with various black and gray industries. My parents taught me how to be a good person, and the law still advised me; I didn&amp;rsquo;t go completely astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous link: [That Year We Were Young]({&amp;lt; relref &amp;ldquo;/post/2023/01-09-那时少年&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt;}})&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had one relationship during college, but looking back now, it was more about longing for the kind of love seen in TV dramas. At that time, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t mature enough to understand how to truly love someone, let alone build a family and establish myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-two&#34;&gt;Chapter Two
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been fortunate amidst the tide of time. After a period of upheaval during my university years, I naturally couldn’t pursue graduate studies and started working right after graduation. Riding the wave of the IT industry, things have gone smoothly. It’s already been eight years since I started working, and as the hot money in the industry disappears, it&amp;rsquo;s gradually coming to a close. Sometimes I wonder if my initial choices were wrong; perhaps entering the power grid as my father suggested would have been a better option. I might have had those thoughts during the first five years of my career, but they slowly faded away. Joining Hang Seng through campus recruitment, I didn’t change companies for five years. There are definitely shortcomings in terms of technical understanding, industry knowledge, and self-awareness. Following arrangements from the Hangzhou headquarters, I went to the Shenzhen branch, where I experienced a workplace struggle (only later did I understand the underlying issues – both sides lost, and the ultimate winner was the board). Driven by my passion for technology, I returned to Hangzhou, carrying a bit of youthful naivete, and then left Hangzhou, moving to Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally planned to settle down, register household registration, and buy a house in Hangzhou. With interest rates at their peak and housing prices at their highest, entering the market would mean being stuck with a mortgage right away. My family savings are limited, so I can’t afford this kind of financial strain. The thought of getting married while carrying that mortgage burden, combined with the downturn in the industry, makes me emotionally unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-three&#34;&gt;Chapter Three
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After so many years, having seen so much, I&amp;rsquo;ve been foolish and reckless myself. Currently, things are going well. Going through some experiences and encountering certain people has gradually matured me. If I had stayed at home all this time, I wonder in what form the flaws in my personality would have erupted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We conducted a time-consuming test of the Design Quotation SDK, implementing different callback function approaches. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at C++ functional programming – what difference does it make in terms of performance when functions become first-class citizens and circulate within a program?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why do computers generally use little-endian storage?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/little-endian-storage-why/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;An Explanation of Byte Order [Host Order, Network Order, Observing Directly Through a Debugger]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some design habits formed due to historical reasons in the computer field are like the principle that the width of a horse&amp;rsquo;s rear end determines the width of a rocket engine – there’s no need to analyze their “advantages” and “disadvantages”; they’re simply historical conventions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reprint-of-the-main-text&#34;&gt;Reprint of the main text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current endianness situation is a result of historical habits and commercialization, not really related to the technology itself. ARM can be configured as either big-endian or little-endian. The TCP/IP header still uses big-endian (network byte order). There are also many storage protocols/specifications in the storage field that save data in big-endian format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the three questions raised by the original poster, looking back today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do computers generally use little-endian storage? &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Incorrect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficiency is not necessarily higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to justify these three issues based on current technology is like drawing a target before shooting an arrow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to the choice between big-endian and little-endian, there were indeed certain objective factors in the history of computer development: Advantages of host byte order (little-endian): Little-endian adders are easier to implement. If you want to build an 8-bit * 4 adder, you only need one 8-bit adder and can simply loop through all bytes from low to high and add them. The carry circuit is very simple. However, with big-endian, you need to load 32 bits at once, otherwise the calculation cannot be performed. Looking at it now, there’s not much difference between loading 8 bits or 32 bits, but decades ago, memory was expensive, so simplicity was preferred. Therefore, the choice of little-endian for host byte order was based on cost considerations. Advantages of network byte order (big-endian): Early devices had very small caches, and receiving the high byte first allowed for quick determination of packet information: package length (how much cache to prepare), address range (IP addresses are matched from front to back). Early networking devices used bytes as their unit, so taking the high byte first was indeed faster. Therefore, network devices use big-endian, also based on cost considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the choice of byte order has historically been driven more by application scenarios and cost considerations (such as PPC/MIPS being better suited for network devices), and later, due to compatibility reasons, the endian configuration has continued to be used until today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at it today, these advantages no longer exist at all; they are merely historical habits&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;On a whim, I thought about finding new wallpaper. I usually go with black backgrounds, with some colored areas. Since there will be icons on the desktop, other color schemes would make them unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stared at the assembly code for a while, couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand it. Tried throwing it to &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, which explained the instructions but not the context. It must be an instruction used in some specific scenario; it wouldn’t appear in regular code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI is not as good as search engines now; it lacks sufficient knowledge accumulated through assembly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wallpaper&#34;&gt;Wallpaper
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black assembly wallpaper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assembly-code&#34;&gt;Assembly code
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;PUSHFD
MOV DWORD PTR [ESP],0X100
POPFD
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual application scenarios&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;bool IsDebugged()
{
    __try
    {
        __asm
        {
            pushfd
            mov dword ptr [esp], 0x100
            popfd
            nop
        }
        return true;
    }
    __except(GetExceptionCode() == EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP
        ? EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER
        : EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION)
    {
        return false;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanation&#34;&gt;Explanation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;TrapFlag&lt;/code&gt; is a flag in the status register. When this flag is set, an exception &lt;code&gt;SINGLE_STEP&lt;/code&gt; is thrown. Because if we are tracing code, the debugger clears this flag, so we won&amp;rsquo;t see this exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In actual testing, if you step over the detection and debugging functions directly, the debugging will not be detected; it is only detected when stepping into the execution of the detection function (literature query, not yet actually verified)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relevant materials in Chinese are translations of website drafts, and the site explains many anti-debugging techniques&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to download Focus Interviews/CCTV video files</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-download-focus-interview-cctv-video-files/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:23:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-download-focus-interview-cctv-video-files/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, some people have asked how to download CCTV’s “Focus Interviews” videos. I immediately thought it was likely encrypted using the &lt;code&gt;m3u8&lt;/code&gt; method, so I quickly dealt with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;downloader&#34;&gt;Downloader
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-CLI&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-CLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An open-source command-line m3u8/HLS/DASH downloader that supports standard AES-128-CBC decryption, multi-threading, custom request headers, etc. Supports Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and English. English Supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;browser-extension&#34;&gt;Browser extension
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ngjclnbcdbahekojpkhancmiobdahemb&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Live Stream Downloader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;honey-glazed-confidence&#34;&gt;Honey-glazed confidence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got the address, thought I was done with it, but it turned out to be nothing. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t normally parse the segmented content. After checking the information, I found that the official side had handled the download address and required manual replacement. The &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; parsed by the plugin needs to be manually copied and replaced in the link below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;https://newcntv.qcloudcdn.com/asp/hls/2000/0303000a/3/default/***********************/2000.m3u8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of January 2024, address testing is valid. If there are any changes afterward, analyze the webpage yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical address backup: &lt;code&gt;https://hlswx.cntv.kcdnvip.com/asp/hls/main/0303000a/3/default/A string of characters/main.m3u8?maxbr=2000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Batch modification of SQL Server database disk file permissions</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-modify-sqlserver-database-disk-file-permissions/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:06:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-modify-sqlserver-database-disk-file-permissions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;rsquo;s security policy has been adjusted, and &lt;code&gt;Mechanical Master mini&lt;/code&gt; was ultimately moved back home as a backup server. The machine system was also reinstalled, and &lt;code&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/code&gt; switched to &lt;code&gt;Windows Server&lt;/code&gt;. Since the activation method wasn’t legitimate, it seems fine without activating when used at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating through unconventional means triggered Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s detection (it had been running normally for half a month). The server shut down automatically after one hour of being turned on. After checking the system logs, it was discovered to be due to piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no way around it, I have to reinstall the system again. &lt;code&gt;SqlServer&lt;/code&gt; also needs a reinstall. Each time is quite troublesome; strict file permission controls prevent me from properly attaching the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;error-message&#34;&gt;Error message
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reinstalling the system, an error of 5120 and access denied may occur when attaching a database in &lt;code&gt;SqlServer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-script&#34;&gt;Process script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link to the previous article: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-repository-and-legacy-permission-issues/&#34; &gt;Batch Update Local Git Repository&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s this familiar script again, modified so that while we traverse the folders, we also change the file permissions to grant full editing rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the online tutorials require you to manually modify things. Do they only need to change a few files each time? I have to deal with batches of files every time, all manually – it&amp;rsquo;s enough to make someone feel depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;$currentUserName = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$rootDirectory = &amp;quot;D:\data\2013_RujiaInfo&amp;quot;

Get-ChildItem -Path $rootDirectory -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    $itemPath = $_.FullName

    if ($_ -is [System.IO.DirectoryInfo]) {
        $icaclsResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;已更改文件夹 $itemPath 的所有者为 $currentUserName&amp;quot;
            # 授予当前用户写入权限
            Invoke-Expression &amp;quot;icacls `&amp;quot;$itemPath`&amp;quot; /grant `&amp;quot;$($currentUserName):(OI)(CI)F`&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
            Write-Host &amp;quot;已授予 $currentUserName 编辑文件夹的权限&amp;quot;
        } else {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;无法更改文件夹 $itemPath 的所有者。错误信息: $icaclsResult&amp;quot;
        }
    } else {
        $takeownResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            # 授予当前用户写入权限
            Invoke-Expression &amp;quot;icacls `&amp;quot;$itemPath`&amp;quot; /grant `&amp;quot;$($currentUserName):(F)`&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
            Write-Host &amp;quot;已授予 $currentUserName 编辑文件的权限&amp;quot;
        } else {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;无法更改文件 $itemPath 的所有者。错误信息: $takeownResult&amp;quot;

        <title>Linux system benchmark testing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-system-benchmark-test/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 10:56:23 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-system-benchmark-test/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Windows platform has a program called &amp;ldquo;Rulu Master&amp;rdquo; (Entertainment Master), which isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily accurate with its data, but it does provide some reference. Of course, there are other professional benchmarking software available. On the Linux system, I haven’t found any particularly suitable benchmarking software yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sysbench is a versatile benchmarking tool that can be used to test CPU, memory, file I/O, thread performance, and more. You can use Sysbench to perform various performance testing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just happen to have three machines available for testing: Mecha-Debug Mini local host, Alibaba Cloud Dev development cloud server, and Huawei Cloud development server&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-sysbench&#34;&gt;Installing Sysbench
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most Linux distributions, you can use a package management tool to install Sysbench. For example, on CentOS 8, you can use the following command for installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo dnf install sysbench
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;examples-of-using-sysbench&#34;&gt;Examples of Using Sysbench
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test CPU performance: &lt;code&gt;sysbench --test=cpu run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test memory read performance: &lt;code&gt;sysbench --test=memory run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing File I/O Performance:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sysbench --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw prepare
sysbench --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw run
sysbench --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw cleanup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing multi-threading performance: &lt;code&gt;sysbench --test=threads --num-threads=4 run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing MySQL database performance (requires adjusting the maximum number of connections):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=yourusername --mysql-password=yourpassword --oltp-table-size=1000000 prepare
sysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=yourusername --mysql-password=yourpassword --max-time=60 --oltp-read-only=off --oltp-test-mode=complex --max-requests=0 run
sysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=yourusername --mysql-password=yourpassword cleanup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is still a good thing. The table there cannot be arranged according to the previously mastered Markdown; if it&amp;rsquo;s not made into a table, the display effect will be very poor. Custom themes limited the maximum page width, and I adjusted the page configuration in sync, changing the width to a percentage limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple method is to use online tools like TablesGenerator to generate HTML tables (not suitable for complex content)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or use Google Docs online, then download and save as an HTML document, and directly copy it into the blog (simple and direct, this is the method we adopted)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure the config is enabled with the unsafe setting, and configure the width separately for each page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hugo, you can set the width for pages individually. This can be achieved by adding a custom parameter in the page&amp;rsquo;s Front Matter. Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a custom parameter, such as &lt;code&gt;custom_width&lt;/code&gt;, in the Front Matter section of your Markdown page (usually at the beginning of the file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;---
title: &amp;quot;我的页面&amp;quot;
date: 2024-01-09
custom_width: &amp;quot;800px&amp;quot;  # 设置宽度为 800 像素
---

正文内容...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your Hugo theme, find or create the corresponding single-page template file (for example, &lt;code&gt;layouts/_default/single.html&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In single-page templates, check for a &lt;code&gt;custom_width&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the page&amp;rsquo;s Front Matter and apply it to the corresponding HTML element, such as a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34;&gt;{{ define &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; }}
  &amp;lt;div style=&amp;quot;max-width: {{ with .Params.custom_width }}{{ . }}{{ else }}100%{{ end }}; margin: 0 auto;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    {{ .Content }}
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we used inline styles (the &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; attribute) to set the &lt;code&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt; property for the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; element, so that when the &lt;code&gt;custom_width&lt;/code&gt; parameter is not specified, its width defaults to 100%. &lt;code&gt;margin: 0 auto;&lt;/code&gt; is used to center the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that in practical applications, you may need to adjust the above examples according to your theme structure and CSS style details. Ensure consistency and readability of your theme when adjusting styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to slight differences in the enabled theme, the site&amp;rsquo;s custom &lt;code&gt;CSS&lt;/code&gt; configuration was adjusted&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Disable HTTP repositories in Git</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-disable-http-repositories/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 21:22:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-disable-http-repositories/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to updating software versions, but I don’t know from which version of &lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt; onwards it started prohibiting pulling code from &lt;code&gt;HTTP&lt;/code&gt; repositories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;fatal: Unencrypted HTTP is not supported for GitLab. Ensure the repository remote URL is using HTTPS
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-introduction&#34;&gt;Background introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environment: Windows platform, I&amp;rsquo;ve always used TortoiseGit to operate git, and configured keys through TortoiseGit as well. I previously set up a script to batch update local repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous link: [Batch Update Local Git Repository]({relref &amp;ldquo;/post/2023/10-19-批量更新本地git仓库&amp;rdquo;})&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I tried to deploy a code update at home today, the error mentioned earlier occurred, and the repository could not be updated normally. I thought &lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt; should provide a configuration option to allow me to continue updating the repository using the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; protocol, but I searched around and couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the corresponding setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest solution is of course to switch to the &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; protocol to update the repository, as the company&amp;rsquo;s configuration will not provide the &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; protocol for &lt;code&gt;gitlab&lt;/code&gt; in the short term&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outstanding-issues&#34;&gt;Outstanding issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing the batch update local repository script earlier, I originally intended to pull the repository using &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;, but didn&amp;rsquo;t investigate why it failed. It turned out that the &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; configuration information configured in TortoiseGit wasn&amp;rsquo;t synchronized to the config file, which caused issues when executing through the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git pull #提示没有权限，无法正常更新仓库
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking the key configuration with a command is also correct: &lt;code&gt;ssh -T git@gitlab.yintech.net&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can normally pull code using TortoiseGit, but are prompted with a key error when using the &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; command in the command line, this may be because TortoiseGit uses PuTTY’s SSH key while the command line uses OpenSSH’s SSH key&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small turtle&amp;rsquo;s key configuration does not read key file information from the system .ssh folder, but instead configures the key file path separately when configuring the interface repository. A useful tip: configuring a key for the first repository being pulled allows other repositories to reuse this key file. After PuTTY loads the key, it doesn’t immediately exit but starts an agent service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adjusting the global configuration and not using the system&amp;rsquo;s default &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; configuration, Git Bash will use TortoisePlink for SSH operations with this configuration. This setup is suitable for situations where you are using the PuTTY tool that comes with TortoiseGit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git config --global core.sshCommand &amp;quot;&#39;C:/Program Files/TortoiseGit/bin/TortoisePlink.exe&#39; -batch -ssh&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modify the execution file path as needed to correspond with your Little Turtle installation directory. Since a full path is configured, you do not need to add it to your system environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>AI programming and task decomposition</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-programming-and-task-decomposition/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 08:44:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-programming-and-task-decomposition/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I added a copy function for the code area on the site. It took almost half a day of effort, and the final rendering effect was not ideal. As a novice front-end developer, I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to improve it; as long as it worked, that was fine. This year, using &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; to develop a mini program, I’m also more familiar with front-end development, so I rebuilt (redesigned by AI) it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the Dao: The task has been broken down into many small tasks, and AI development is still smooth. For a previously defunct mini-program, 75% of the code was provided by AI, and it was delivered through multiple tasks, with manual assembly of project code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;previous-text&#34;&gt;Previous text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a code copy button to what seems like a simple thing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design CSS and JavaScript code to locate webpage elements with the class &amp;ldquo;highlight&amp;rdquo;. Within the container of these elements, add a copy button to implement the functionality of copying the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first draft of the code looks problematic at a glance. A second draft was generated, which is basically usable, but contains incorrect copied content and redundant text. Further optimization is needed, with manual specification of core color design and included effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand you have specific requirements for the button&amp;rsquo;s size and color. We can redesign the button style to accommodate these requirements. Here is an adjusted CSS style, which includes the color scheme you provided and optimizes the button’s dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-css&#34;&gt;.copy-btn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 2px; /* 调整位置 */
  right: 2px;
  padding: 3px 6px; /* 缩小尺寸 */
  font-size: 12px; /* 减小字体大小 */
  background-color: #8FD1E1; /* 按钮背景色 */
  color: #272822; /* 文字颜色 */
  border: 1px solid #272822; /* 边框颜色 */
  border-radius: 3px; /* 圆角 */
  cursor: pointer;
  opacity: 0.7; /* 默认半透明 */
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease, background-color 0.3s ease; /* 平滑过渡效果 */
}

.copy-btn:hover {
  opacity: 1; /* 鼠标悬停时不透明 */
  background-color: #A3D4E5; /* 鼠标悬停时的背景色 */
}

.highlight {
  position: relative;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this style, I have reduced the size of the buttons and font size to make them more refined. At the same time, the default state of the button is semi-transparent, and when the mouse hovers over it, it becomes opaque, and the background color will become slightly brighter to provide visual feedback. This design both meets your color requirements and maintains a modern and user-friendly feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simpler JavaScript was provided accordingly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-JavaScript&#34;&gt;document.addEventListener(&#39;DOMContentLoaded&#39;, function() {
  // 查找所有 .highlight 元素
  const highlights = document.querySelectorAll(&#39;.highlight&#39;);

  highlights.forEach(function(highlight) {
    // 创建复制按钮
    const copyBtn = document.createElement(&#39;button&#39;);
    copyBtn.textContent = &#39;复制&#39;;
    copyBtn.classList.add(&#39;copy-btn&#39;);

    // 将按钮添加到每个 .highlight 元素中
    highlight.appendChild(copyBtn);

    // 添加点击事件监听器
    copyBtn.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function() {
      // 假设 .highlight 下的第一个 &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; 元素包含要复制的代码
      const code = highlight.querySelector(&#39;code&#39;) ? highlight.querySelector(&#39;code&#39;).textContent : &#39;&#39;;

      navigator.clipboard.writeText(code).then(() =&amp;gt; {
        // 显示复制成功信息
        copyBtn.textContent = &#39;已复制!&#39;;
        setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; {
          copyBtn.textContent = &#39;复制&#39;;
        }, 2000);
      }).catch(err =&amp;gt; {
        console.error(&#39;复制失败: &#39;, err);
      });
    });
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I would prefer a copy button to be added in the top area of the code region, due to my lack of understanding of frontend development, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t accurately describe the function based on keywords. After several rounds of troubleshooting with &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, it still didn’t reach the expected result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just that I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much impact AI will have on software development as time goes on&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Dongfang Zhenxuan&#39;s Short Essay Controversy: A Clash of Culture and Commerce</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/dongfang-zhenxuan-essay-controversy-culture-vs-commerce/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 18:57:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/dongfang-zhenxuan-essay-controversy-culture-vs-commerce/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Select incident involving short essays is a network controversy triggered by the denial from the official Oriental Select account that Dong Yuhui was the author of all the short essays. The truth is now impossible to verify, and corporate power struggles have pushed this matter into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The myth of the seven-second memory span of fish – I&amp;rsquo;ve been letting AI write about it, trying both &lt;code&gt;Bing AI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT plus&lt;/code&gt;. The former provides more complete information, still leveraging a larger pool of data from search engines. However, its blog post output is incomplete and the formatting feels rigid. The latter generates content based on keywords, which isn’t always comprehensive, but can produce full blog posts. Providing reference URLs allows it to optimize the generated draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dong Yuhui incident involving Oriental Selection is a dispute over copyright and authorship, beginning on December 5, 2023, and involving a series of interactions between the livestreamer Dong Yuhui and Oriental Selection. This controversy not only reveals the complexity of business operations but also prompts deep reflection on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-5-2023-event-start&#34;&gt;December 5, 2023: Event Start
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Selection released a teaser video, and host Dong Yuhui&amp;rsquo;s recitation of a &amp;ldquo;short essay&amp;rdquo; quickly went viral&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongfang Zhenxuan stated in video comments that these short essays were mostly created by the copywriting team and not entirely written by Dong Yuhui&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-13-2023-dong-yu-huis-response&#34;&gt;December 13, 2023: Dong Yu Hui&amp;rsquo;s Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Yu Hui published a long article, opposing the stigmatization of anyone under the guise of &amp;ldquo;fan circles,&amp;rdquo; and stating his position on the matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-14-2023-managements-response&#34;&gt;December 14, 2023: Management&amp;rsquo;s Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Selection CEO Sun Dongxue released an apology video, admitting flaws in the company&amp;rsquo;s management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Yuhui also received an apology from Dongfang Zhenxuan Chairman Yu Minhong, who responded to the incident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-16-2023-major-decision&#34;&gt;December 16, 2023: Major Decision
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Selection officially announced that Sun Dongxu is removed from his CEO position, and Yu Minhong will concurrently serve as CEO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the same day, Yu Minhong issued an apology letter stating that he would remove the blacklisting of netizens in the livestreaming room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-18-2023-dong-yu-huis-new-role&#34;&gt;December 18, 2023: Dong Yu Hui&amp;rsquo;s New Role
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Oriental Education &amp;amp; Technology Group has appointed Dong Yuhui as Cultural Assistant to the Chairman of New Oriental Education &amp;amp; Technology Group, and concurrently Vice President of New Oriental Tourism Group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yu Minhong revealed that he will establish a studio with Dong Yuhui and open new live streaming accounts and rooms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-and-reflection&#34;&gt;Conclusion and Reflection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This incident is not only a dispute over copyright and authorship, but also reflects the collision of culture and commerce at a deeper level. In the context of this digital age characterized by fragmentation, the ownership of content creation has become a topic worthy of deep consideration. The Oriental Select short essay event is not just a media storm; it&amp;rsquo;s a profound reflection on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As observers, how should we view this collision of culture and commerce? While pursuing commercial interests, how can we protect and respect the creators&amp;rsquo; labor fruits? These questions are worthy of deep reflection by each of us&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Game psychology: Competitive gaming</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-esports/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Games that require spending money—we don&amp;rsquo;t discuss this here. Within the gaming community, they are commonly called &amp;ldquo;money warriors.&amp;rdquo; It doesn’t require understanding game mechanics, just a substantial wallet. Their enjoyment comes from being surrounded by subordinates and the thrill of “city-destroying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitive games with a wide audience, such as League of Legends, Dota, Honor of Kings, and PlayerUnknown&amp;rsquo;s Battlegrounds, have world-building that is fully established, and their esports scenes are already in a virtuous cycle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In game design, psychology is indeed a key area, and social psychology is particularly important. Understanding people&amp;rsquo;s behavior, needs, and motivations can help design more engaging game experiences. Regarding the relationship between &amp;ldquo;showing off&amp;rdquo; and social psychology, we can look at it from the following perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social recognition: People often seek to establish a sense of belonging within social groups. In games, if the design allows players to feel exceptional in some way and attract the attention of other players, it can increase their social recognition. This may manifest as showing off skills or displaying earned rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social competition: Some games incorporate elements of social competition, encouraging players to showcase their achievements on social networks. This can be achieved through leaderboards, achievement systems, or multiplayer battles. Such design stimulates a competitive psychology among players and may lead some players to perform better in order to gain social recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-presentation: Some games allow players to express themselves through customizing characters, virtual items, and other means. This self-presentation is not just about showing off; it can also be a way of expressing individuality and engaging in social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teamwork: Some games emphasize teamwork, achieving game objectives through social interaction. In such situations, showing off may not be encouraged, but rather team collaboration and mutual support are stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological reward systems: Game design can adopt psychological reward systems to stimulate players&amp;rsquo; positive social behaviors. For example, giving players rewards or privileges to encourage them to actively participate in social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, social psychology in game design can be used to shape interactions and social experiences among players. While showing off behavior may exist in certain situations, game designers typically work to balance this behavior to ensure a positive and enjoyable gaming experience for all players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write as I think, there&amp;rsquo;s no complete outline, so it&amp;rsquo;s a little messy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author often plays League of Legends, which is a shared memory of our generation. Most parents don&amp;rsquo;t like their children playing games because they haven’t deeply understood or experienced this type of game. This is also related to the game design; each game is a new beginning. For many children, when they play, they don&amp;rsquo;t bring too much thought into it, but rather explore on their own. In this mode, winning or losing depends more on the child’s innate gaming talent. Based on my personal experience, a considerable number of players fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost isn&amp;rsquo;t money, it&amp;rsquo;s time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game also features an entertainment mode to cater to the needs of casual players&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, League of Legends is more about fulfilling a &amp;ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&amp;rdquo; dream. You start with nothing, and through your understanding, last-hitting, farming, spending resources, controlling vision, setting traps for the enemy – it&amp;rsquo;s more about using your brain than having exceptional gaming talent, and you can still have a lot of fun. The feeling of being in control of everything, the joy of turning around a losing game. And there are also many &amp;ldquo;spectator players&amp;rdquo; who don’t play the game anymore, but still watch the matches during Worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s unavoidable to mention &lt;code&gt;game time&lt;/code&gt;. This isn&amp;rsquo;t referring to the duration of a single game, but rather when you log in – weekend afternoons, or between 7 pm and 10 pm on weeknights. You’ll find that most communication with teammates goes smoothly; your signals are understood, and you receive responses. If you switch to other times, like playing through the night, you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to encounter &lt;code&gt;internet addicts&lt;/code&gt;. In good situations, nothing happens. When things go badly, they can insult your whole family, and you can feel that sense of resentment radiating from the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the IT industry, so I’ve had a lot of exposure to games and played many different types. When it comes to competitive games, I always rely on strategy rather than reaction speed. My natural aptitude is there, but compared to professionals or younger players, my reactions are slower. I&amp;rsquo;m used to playing with groups and taking control of the team’s direction. I started playing back when I was studying, playing alongside the older members of a guild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gaming environment now is quite restless, lacking the purity of before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After moving up in grade, playing high-level matches is really tiring. It requires intense concentration throughout the entire game, constantly thinking about your opponent&amp;rsquo;s plans and how to counter their setups – it’s the kind of experience where you don’t want to continue after finishing a match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, being really good at gaming isn&amp;rsquo;t that useful if you don’t pursue it as a profession; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change your life trajectory. It can be used for socializing, but it can’t provide a livelihood or allow you to establish yourself in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-player games and online games are two different types of games, with significant differences in gameplay, experience, and technology. Here are some key aspects to understand the distinctions between single-player and online games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connection method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standalone games (Offline/Single-player): These games are played alone on a local device and do not require an internet connection. Players can enjoy the gaming experience without network connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These games typically require an internet connection because players need to interact with each other in real time. Online games can be cooperative or competitive, involving online socializing and competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Player interaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single-player games: Players primarily interact with in-game artificial intelligence, pre-set missions, or adversarial elements. The gaming experience is typically more personalized and influenced by the game&amp;rsquo;s design and storyline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online games: Players can interact with other real players from around the world. This may include cooperating to complete quests, competing against or challenging each other, and social elements such as chat, guild systems, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game design and content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single-player games: Game design focuses on providing a complete and independent storyline and gaming experience. The game content is typically pre-designed, and players explore, solve puzzles, or engage in combat within the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online games: Game design needs to consider real-time interaction and competition or collaboration between players. The game content may be more dynamic, including regular updates, online events, and social interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standalone games typically run offline and have relatively low requirements for device performance and internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online games require a strong internet connection and have high demands on server and network performance to ensure smooth real-time interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standalone games typically use a one-time purchase or download business model, allowing players to fully play the game on their local device after purchasing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online games may adopt various business models such as free play, advertising, in-game item purchases, or subscriptions to maintain server operations and continuously update game content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these differences helps players clarify their preferences when choosing a game and allows game designers to better meet player expectations&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Cloud server and script kiddie</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cloud-servers-and-script-kids/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 15:08:53 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cloud-servers-and-script-kids/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of the Double Eleven promotion, Alibaba Cloud has purchased a new server: an economical version, costing 99 yuan per year. The configuration isn&amp;rsquo;t high-end, but it’s good as a jump server to proxy services for home use. The promotion lasts until 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I specifically chose a server in the Shanghai area, proxying my home machine with low latency. It&amp;rsquo;s Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022; the server version was deployed later. When I tried to use it, I suddenly received an &amp;ldquo;access denied&amp;rdquo; message. I initially thought it was due to a server update and would return to normal shortly. After waiting five minutes, I tried again, but still couldn&amp;rsquo;t log in. Searching for related errors indicated that someone was attempting to log in, and now login is unavailable due to too many incorrect password attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve previously dealt with security attack scripts, and immediately thought that these logins are likely not normal behavior – someone is attacking the service, attempting to brute-force the login server. The server firewall settings were convenient but didn’t set up whitelists. It proxied the 3389 ports of two machines, exposing them on the public network—just like bait in a fishpond. Now that I know it&amp;rsquo;s a script kiddie attacking, the next steps are simple: configure the firewall whitelist to only allow access to the proxy service from company IP addresses and home IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frps agent server wasn&amp;rsquo;t configured with running logs before. After enabling the logs, I was quite surprised to see proxy IPs from all over the country attempting to log in to my home server. Luckily, one of them was a server version, which alerted me to the problem. Otherwise, that Windows 11 machine would have been compromised eventually – the password was set up pretty simply.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Batch update local Git repository and legacy permission issues</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-repository-and-legacy-permission-issues/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The projects within the team have dependencies on each other. Due to historical reasons, &lt;code&gt;submodules&lt;/code&gt; were not used to manage these dependencies. As a result, developers need to manually update the repository code sequentially during daily development; otherwise, they may encounter various strange issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referencing online resources, the structures are generally similar. Maintain a local repository directory manually: &lt;strong&gt;git_list.txt&lt;/strong&gt;. Write a script to traverse the directory and perform an update in one go. Before starting work, run the script first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;linux&#34;&gt;linux
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;create new file: batch_pull.sh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;historical-legacies&#34;&gt;Historical legacies
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handling the &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; folder permission files after reinstalling the system: &lt;strong&gt;Fatal error &amp;ldquo;unsafe repository (&amp;rsquo;/home/repon&amp;rsquo; is owned by someone else)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the suggested practices online come from &lt;code&gt;stack overflow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add trusted directory: &lt;code&gt;git config --global --add safe.directory /home/repon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manually modify the &lt;code&gt;.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt; configuration file and specify the directory to be trusted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;[safe]
    directory = /home/repon
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After handling it in the above manner, the warehouse update is normal, but there are a lot of warning messages in the console when executing &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;, indicating an owner error&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reinstalling-the-system-on-a-desktop-computer&#34;&gt;Reinstalling the system on a desktop computer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development machine hasn&amp;rsquo;t been reinstalled in a long time, and the system disk is full of junk files. There was nothing I could do, so I took the time to reinstall the system. I encountered this permission issue again, and previous scripts won’t run because the permissions are incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the new scheme, directly add &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; will automatically trust all directories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git config --global --add safe.directory &amp;quot;*&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it’s a user permissions issue, or whether people aren&amp;rsquo;t used to the fact that the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; platform also has commands similar to &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt;. You can modify the folder owner, of course. If you don’t have many directories, manually modifying the owners is fine. However, this work computer has domain information added, and I’m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s an anomaly with the company&amp;rsquo;s deployed domain or a local system setting issue. The user used for login couldn&amp;rsquo;t be found in the user list, so I ultimately handled it through the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administrator privileges, execute the &lt;code&gt;powershell&lt;/code&gt; script &lt;code&gt;change_ower.ps1&lt;/code&gt;. Remember to adjust the script file encoding to &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt;, for Chinese operating systems, otherwise it will display garbled characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-powershell&#34;&gt;# 获取当前用户的用户名
$currentUserName = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name

# 设置 PowerShell 的字符编码为 UTF-8
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8

# 要更改所有者的根目录路径
$rootDirectory = &amp;quot;G:\workspace&amp;quot;  # 替换为实际的目录路径

# 递归遍历目录并更改文件和文件夹的所有者
Get-ChildItem -Path $rootDirectory -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    $itemPath = $_.FullName

    # 检查是文件还是文件夹
    if ($_ -is [System.IO.DirectoryInfo]) {
        # 如果是文件夹，使用 icacls 更改所有者权限
        $icaclsResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;已更改文件夹 $itemPath 的所有者为 $currentUserName&amp;quot;
        } else {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;无法更改文件夹 $itemPath 的所有者。错误信息: $icaclsResult&amp;quot;
        }
    } else {
        # 如果是文件，使用 icacls 更改所有者权限
        $takeownResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            # Write-Host &amp;quot;已更改文件 $itemPath 的所有者为 $currentUserName&amp;quot;
        } else {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;无法更改文件 $itemPath 的所有者。错误信息: $takeownResult&amp;quot;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, something unexpected still happened. The Chinese information output by the script execution was garbled. I tried setting the console character encoding and adjusting the script encoding, but everything was still garbled. It felt like my brain wasn&amp;rsquo;t working properly. I then tried enabling the beta feature of Control Panel-Region-Language settings and globally enabled Unicode encoding. The script executed normally, but several development software stopped working correctly. Later, when reviewing the materials, I remembered to adjust the script file’s encoding to &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WPF learning materials</title>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wpf-learning-resources/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The pitfalls of mini-program development weren&amp;rsquo;t resolved yet, and now I’m diving into &lt;strong&gt;WPF&lt;/strong&gt;, on top of recent turbulence at the company. Inter-location collaboration and communication have been inefficient, so I’ve taken on client interface development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wpf&#34;&gt;WPF
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommended &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/dotnet/desktop/wpf/introduction-to-wpf?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8&amp;amp;preserve-view=true&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF Microsoft Official Learning Resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary of WPF Basics (Learning Suggestions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WPF Chinese Website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary and Learning Recommendations for WPF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many concepts used in WPF interface design are similar to those in web frontend design. The goal is to separate UI design from business logic as much as possible, allowing the UI to be independent—this is also how internet companies expect tasks to be divided. I just spent some time working on mini-programs this year, and many of the concepts are universal, making it relatively easy to get started. These are considered the &lt;strong&gt;principles&lt;/strong&gt; in modern UI design. Mastering the basic framework concepts will keep you from going astray later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers with prior experience in &lt;code&gt;Winform&lt;/code&gt; development are recommended to read: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cnblogs.com/zh7791/p/11502696.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF Basics Summary (Learning Suggestions)&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not a long article and suitable for experienced readers planning their learning path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For readers with no prior knowledge, it is recommended to read: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wpfsoft.com/introduction&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF Chinese Net&lt;/a&gt;, which introduces basic concepts, the history of development, and the logic of understanding underlying classes from scratch. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a coincidence that this website was just released by the author in August this year, and it aligns perfectly with our timeline. If it were any later, we probably wouldn’t have had the chance to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the most authentic learning materials, of course it&amp;rsquo;s the documentation from Microsoft’s official website; it can be a bit dry, so new readers need to have patience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also many classic e-books, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really recommend them. I have a lot of work to do every day, so I don’t have much time to sit down and read. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get into the reading mood; practicing with projects is more suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;c-and-net-release-history&#34;&gt;C# and .NET release history
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there have been quite a few new features released, and the language&amp;rsquo;s version is iterating annually, similar to previously learned languages&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The curtain-raising of anti-corruption in finance</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 14:53:35 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China: Efforts to combat corruption in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector must be intensified, and addressing the “four vices” should be pursued thoroughly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-political-bureau-of-the-communist-party-of-china&#34;&gt;The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held a meeting on September 27 to review the comprehensive report on the findings of the first round of inspections by the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection during the 20th CPC National Congress. General Secretary of the CPC Xi Jinping presided over the meeting. The meeting emphasized that, taking the rectification of issues identified through inspections as an opportunity, it is necessary to further strengthen the Party’s overall leadership, urge inspected Party organizations to enhance their political awareness and earnestly fulfill the responsibilities and missions entrusted by the CPC Central Committee, continuously strengthen the core functions and core competitiveness of state-owned enterprises, consolidate the essential material and political foundations of socialism with Chinese characteristics, increase the efforts of financial institutions in serving the real economy and national strategies, and promote high-quality development. It is necessary to balance development and security, firmly establish a bottom-line and extreme thinking mindset, take effective measures to prevent and resolve major risks, and resolutely safeguard the safety threshold. Efforts should be made to deepen the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party, tighten and implement the responsibility of Party committee secretaries as first responsible persons, the “one-post, two-responsibilities” system for members of leading bodies, and the supervisory responsibilities of disciplinary inspection and supervision organs, with a particular focus on strengthening supervision over &amp;ldquo;top leaders&amp;rdquo; at all levels. Efforts should also be increased to combat corruption in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector, address issues related to “formalism and bureaucracy,” and deepen investigations and rectification efforts, promoting a system where officials dare not, cannot, and do not want to engage in corruption. It is necessary to earnestly implement the Party’s organizational principles for the new era, strengthen leading body construction, cadre and talent team building, and grassroots Party organization construction. The results of inspections should be comprehensively utilized to deepen reform, improve systems, promote source governance, and facilitate a combination of curative and preventative measures. (Xinhua)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Causing major financial risks! Liu Liange, former secretary of the Communist Party Committee and chairman of China Banking Regulatory Commission, has been expelled from the Party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and National Supervisory Commission, with the approval of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and National Supervisory Commission has initiated an investigation into Liu Liange, former secretary of the party committee and chairman of Bank of China, for serious violations of discipline and law
After investigation, Liu Liange lost his ideals and beliefs, abandoned his original aspirations and mission, failed to resolutely implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee, neglected his responsibilities in financial risk prevention and control, extensively interfered with credit projects in violation of regulations, illegally disbursed loans, resulting in major financial risks. He performed poorly in fulfilling the principal responsibility for comprehensively strengthening discipline and governance, seriously damaged the political ecology of his unit, secretly brought prohibited books and publications into the country, and deliberately resisted organizational inspections. He disregarded the spirit of the Central Eight-point Regulation, violated regulations by accepting gifts and cash, entering private clubs, and receiving skiing and travel arrangements, and long-term borrowed vehicles belonging to those he managed. He failed to report personal matters as required, did not truthfully explain issues during organizational inquiries, and improperly appointed, adjusted, or promoted cadres based on personal considerations. He engaged in commercial activities and operated enterprises illegally; interfered with funds lending in violation of regulations and privately retained classified materials. His morals were corrupt, his family conduct was improper, and he failed to properly guide and educate his relatives. He had no bottom line for discipline and law, abused his power for personal gain, “relied on finance to make money from finance,” used his position to seek benefits for others in areas such as loan financing and project cooperation, and illegally accepted large sums of property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu Liange seriously violated Party political discipline, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, work discipline, and daily life discipline, constituting serious official misconduct and suspected bribery and illegal loan disbursement crimes. He failed to restrain himself before and after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, with severe consequences and a negative impact. In accordance with regulations such as the &amp;ldquo;Regulations on Party Discipline,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;Law on Supervision of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China,&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Law on Administrative Punishment of Civil Servants,&amp;rdquo; following deliberation by the Standing Committee of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and approval by the Communist Party of China Central Committee, it was decided to impose the disciplinary action of expulsion from the Party on Liu Liange; revoke the benefits he was entitled to according to regulations; terminate his qualifications as a delegate to the 20th National Congress of the CPC; confiscate the proceeds of his violations and illegal activities; and transfer the issues involving suspected crimes to the procuratorial organ for examination and prosecution, along with all related assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Xiaopeng, former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Guangda Group, has been removed from his party membership and public office due to serious violations of discipline and law. (CCTV News)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and National Supervisory Commission reported, according to news from the Disciplinary Committee and Supervisory Commission of Guizhou Province: Li Zhiming, former Party Secretary and Chairman of Guizhou Bank, is suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently undergoing disciplinary review and investigation by the Disciplinary Committee and Supervisory Commission of Guizhou Province&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;huijin-increases-its-holdings-in-the-four-largest-banks-after-eight-years&#34;&gt;Huijin increases its holdings in the four largest banks after eight years
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 11th, the four largest state-owned commercial banks – Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank – each announced that they had received increased holdings from Huijin Capital, amounting to 27.61 million shares, 37.27 million shares, 24.89 million shares, and 18.38 million shares respectively; Huijin Capital plans to continue increasing its holdings in the four banks on the secondary market within the next six months&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Monetization models based on traffic: Raffles</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/traffic-monetization-business-models-lottery/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 07:04:35 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Host giving away iPhones? Mini-program ranking rewards? Various live streaming platform gift giveaways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three things mentioned above, which don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have much connection, are actually different monetization models for free traffic, with a bit of a financial game feel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;win-gifts-through-platform-lottery&#34;&gt;Win gifts through platform lottery
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typical scenarios, users reset to obtain platform currency, purchase gifts for their favorite streamers. Each platform also has another gameplay: after users acquire platform currency, they no longer directly send gifts but can spend a certain amount of currency to participate in lottery events and obtain limited-edition, high-value gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem has already appeared. Understanding online lotteries simply means the platform is running a casino. With enough participants, it will definitely not lose money. &lt;strong&gt;Commoner&lt;/strong&gt; users are playing with a &amp;ldquo;give it a shot&amp;rdquo; mentality, hoping to win a big prize and then send gifts, showing off and acting like they&amp;rsquo;re in charge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gift-from-streamer-physical-item&#34;&gt;Gift from streamer (physical item)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform&amp;rsquo;s lottery mentioned earlier is aimed at users’ writing. Anchors have monthly activity and popularity tasks; enabling the gifting lottery feature, fans who send designated gifts or gifts of a specified amount will have the opportunity to participate in the lottery, which could be high-end phones or cash rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For popular streamers, this event is quite profitable; it&amp;rsquo;s essentially a temporary free gift campaign. With enough participants, the streamer can still make money. This tests the streamer’s operational capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s another way to play – with high rewards (cash value). Many outdoor streamers use this approach; it’s a disguised form of online gambling. People don’t care about the content of the live stream; users only care whether they can win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from hosts specializing in fashion shows, ordinary game streamers find it difficult to stimulate player spending through PK mode. Playing games and watching streams are leisure activities; people don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend extra money, especially with &lt;strong&gt;competitive games&lt;/strong&gt;. Lottery-style promotions can cultivate users’ charging habits and consumption habits, occasionally leading to impulse purchases (with generous rewards, hoping to win).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mini-program-ranking-rewards&#34;&gt;Mini-program ranking rewards
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design a mini-program with some pointless processes or offer partial game-related support services. All of this is just a cover—to pass Tencent&amp;rsquo;s review, incorporate a ranking mechanism into the mini-program’s gameplay. Users earn points by browsing incentive ads and completing tasks; the backend sets rankings based on these points, and users with higher rankings receive designated rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core logic: Advertising revenue &amp;gt; Operating costs + Reward expenses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mini programs can also operate normally, providing reasonable services, and earning income through appropriate advertising. The earnings may not be much, but a trickle of water can still accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ZeroTier local area network across locations</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/zero-tier-remote-lan/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 04:58:03 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/zero-tier-remote-lan/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently got a mini desktop for the office, thinking it would be convenient to set up an environment and occasionally access things from home. So I temporarily deployed an intranet penetration tool. Based on my past experience, I deployed the &lt;code&gt;frp&lt;/code&gt; service with port forwarding, which requires a public server – the connection quality depends on the bandwidth of that public server. Then I decided to try something new: a &lt;code&gt;Zerotier&lt;/code&gt; virtual machine local area network, similar to a &lt;code&gt;VPN&lt;/code&gt;. I created a new virtual network card locally and added all machines to a virtual network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-zerotier&#34;&gt;What is ZeroTier?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZeroTier is a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) solution that allows users to create secure virtual networks between devices in different geographical locations. With ZeroTier, you can easily connect multiple computers, servers, and devices into a virtual, encrypted network as if they were on the same local area network. This helps programmers and IT professionals securely share data and resources across different locations without complex network setups and VPN configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zerotier Network: Zerotier Network is a virtual, global local area network that allows different devices to connect together over the internet as if they were on the same physical network. This network can contain multiple subnets, and all devices are connected through Zerotier&amp;rsquo;s technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planet servers are one of the key components of the Zerotier network. They are global and responsible for maintaining and managing the topology, routing information, and network status of the entire Zerotier network. Planet servers act as a global network control center but do not directly transmit data. User devices need to connect to at least one planet server to participate in the Zerotier network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relay servers are auxiliary nodes in the Zerotier network, used to help devices establish direct communication channels. When devices cannot connect directly, they can transmit data through relay servers. This helps improve network reachability and performance. Relay servers are typically located around the world, acting as transit points for data transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Zerotier uses planetary and relay servers to enable devices to create a virtual local area network globally, achieving secure and fast communication between devices. Planetary servers are responsible for global network management, while relay servers help devices establish communication connections when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation-and-deployment&#34;&gt;Installation and deployment

    &gt;https://www.zerotier.com/&lt;/a&gt;) to obtain installation files and documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install the ZeroTier One client according to your operating system. It supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and many other platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After installation, start the ZeroTier One client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register a ZeroTier account, if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have one. You can create an account within the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in to your ZeroTier account and create a new network. The network will have a unique 16-character ID that you need to remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join this network on your device. You can enter the network ID in the client or use the QR code scanning function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devices installed with and configured with the ZeroTier client will be added to the same virtual network. These devices can now communicate directly as if they were on the same local area network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can manage network settings, add devices, and monitor network traffic in ZeroTier&amp;rsquo;s control panel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many domestic carriers prohibit UDP tunneling, but frp service is stable. Because it uses the TCP protocol, a similar effect can be achieved by deploying a Zerotier relay server. The firewall needs to open udp 9993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;curl -s https://install.zerotier.com/ | sudo bash

&lt;p&gt;Edit the configuration file, adjust the &lt;code&gt;stableEndpoints&lt;/code&gt; node, &amp;ldquo;public IP address of the server/9993&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate signature configuration, create a &lt;code&gt;moons.d&lt;/code&gt; folder, move the previous files into it, and restart the service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo zerotier-idtool genmoon moon.json

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-uninstall&#34;&gt;How to uninstall
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no need to elaborate on how to uninstall software on Windows; it’s a standard procedure that can be done through the Control Panel. We will focus on Ubuntu instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the zerotier-one service using dpkg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo dpkg -P zerotier-one
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete the zerotier-one folder, which stores the address; deleting it and reinstalling will obtain a new address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo rm -rf /var/lib/zerotier-one/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were all already uninstalled. When the server arrived, there weren&amp;rsquo;t any suitable services available as proxy nodes. Aliyun, pushing for performance, offered developer-exclusive servers with modest configurations at a reasonable price of 99 yuan per year. We used them for two years, primarily because of the bandwidth the servers provided.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>VMware virtual machine disk space optimization</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-disk-space-optimization/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:35:41 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-disk-space-optimization/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When installing a VMware virtual machine development system, it&amp;rsquo;s common practice to reserve extra disk space. Over time, the local disk space occupied far exceeds the actual content of the virtual machine files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scene-description&#34;&gt;Scene description
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;df -h&lt;/code&gt; command shows the disk information of the current machine, which is actually using 60GB. After deleting all snapshots and clone images, the local virtual machine still occupies far more than 60GB of disk space, adding insult to injury for a hard drive that was already not spacious enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34;&gt;Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The virtual machine was installed without allocating the disk space in advance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hard drive where the virtual machine is stored has remaining disk space greater than the space currently occupied by the virtual machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining space is insufficient; you could consider temporarily moving the virtual machine to an external hard drive, and then migrate it back after optimizing the disk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official provider offers the &lt;code&gt;open-vm-tools&lt;/code&gt; package, which can be installed via yum or through the VMware Tools ISO image&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;command&#34;&gt;Command
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;vmware-toolbox-cmd disk shrink /
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After execution, the virtual machine will automatically shut down, and the VMware host program will perform disk compression. The execution time depends on the size of the virtual machine and the access speed of the disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The execution result is still very good, and the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s disk space usage is basically equal to the disk information from &lt;code&gt;df -h&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Stable Diffusion - The ups and downs of installing from scratch</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/stable-diffusion-zero-install-saga/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 00:23:54 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/stable-diffusion-zero-install-saga/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Domestic resources generally recommend &lt;strong&gt;Chuyou&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt; one-click deployment package. Thinking it’s an open-source project based on &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;, I figured the deployment wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too complex, so I decided to try starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I messed around with AI image generation, specifically upgraded my graphics card to an entry-level &lt;code&gt;3060 12g&lt;/code&gt;; the &lt;code&gt;960&lt;/code&gt;, which served faithfully for seven years, has now been retired&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core &lt;code&gt;pytorch CUDA&lt;/code&gt; installation, I had installed it locally before when writing &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; game assistant scripts, but still encountered problems – the &lt;code&gt;CUDA&lt;/code&gt; license could not be activated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pending&#34;&gt;Pending
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reorganize the article structure, first introducing PyTorch, version compatibility, and how to check versions

Organize reference materials&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps&#34;&gt;Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not find a step-by-step installation tutorial by searching in Chinese. If you search in English on &lt;code&gt;Google&lt;/code&gt;, there are many similar tutorials that start from scratch. It briefly introduced the need to install &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, then explained the need to install &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;. Then, it just involved downloading the repository and running the script with a double click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detailed usage and troubleshooting, please refer to the &lt;code&gt;issues&lt;/code&gt; section: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;rsquo;t know why no one explained what this repository is for. Actually, it’s not hard to tell from the name – it’s an interface console that makes it more convenient for us to use. In fact, when installing, it will download the official repository content and obtain the actual &lt;code&gt;SD&lt;/code&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warehouse also includes an installation startup script. It automatically detects whether there is a &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; virtual environment in the current folder. If so, it defaults to using the &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; from the current path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a complete beginner, it’s recommended that you check out: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stable-diffusion-art.com/install-windows/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://stable-diffusion-art.com/install-windows/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pytorch&#34;&gt;pytorch
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I wanted to talk about today. First, don&amp;rsquo;t listen to their instructions and start the script directly. Python installs dependencies through requirement files, which are minor issues. The core issue is your graphics card driver version, which needs to correspond with PyTorch. Many people have already explained this relationship; you can find it online if you search for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40660408/article/details/129896700&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40660408/article/details/129896700&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a virtual environment is like having an empty space where you can directly run the script from the official website to install PyTorch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;python -c &amp;quot;import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;python -c &amp;quot;import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available())&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two scripts above can check the CUDA version you need to install and whether the installation was successful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not recommended to use fancy operations here. Just copy the logic from the official page and install it directly. Install it directly using pip, and your PyTorch is likely to fail or CUDA might not be activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important: Make sure the folder path doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain any unnecessary characters, otherwise it may prevent PyTorch from working properly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed it many times back and forth, and also tried downloading the official installation file and installing it manually. I was just thinking about upgrading to version 2.0 because the official documentation says that version 2.0 will be faster. But I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it much before, and I don’t know if the Python version or something else is affecting it. In the meantime, I also checked the official manual, which recommends using version 3.8. This created a small conflict because the one-click installation package previously used had version 3.10. Finally, I started from scratch by creating a new folder, creating a virtual environment, and ensuring that torch was installed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then move this installed virtual environment into the web UI folder. After that, when you start the installation script, most of the dependency issues should be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After moving, you need to run: python -m pip install &amp;ndash;upgrade &amp;ndash;force-reinstall pip to fix it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem a bit strange, but I spent quite a while troubleshooting this. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t correctly identify my torch, so to eliminate all possible interference factors, I decided to install it first and then the other dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;xformers&#34;&gt;Xformers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to enable it, as it can accelerate image generation and reduce existing usage. The side effect is that &lt;strong&gt;images generated with the same parameters may not be as stable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not recommend the one-click deployment package? Because that package contains some settings that were custom-made by the author, and they are not the same as the official original version. If you&amp;rsquo;re a beginner, you may not know why it’s best to start with the parameters provided by the official source first. As you use it for longer, refer to the official manual more often, and you will understand which parameters need adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;choosing-a-graphics-card&#34;&gt;Choosing a Graphics Card
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the cryptocurrency mining boom, graphics card prices are relatively lower now. For ordinary entry-level players choosing between a 3060 and a 3060 Ti, it&amp;rsquo;s generally recommended to go with the 3060 version with 12GB of VRAM because it can generate images at higher resolutions. Why do you need a higher resolution? Because you can increase the resolution during generation, resulting in clearer and more detailed images. If you’re just generating smaller images, 8GB of VRAM is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the &lt;strong&gt;high-definition enhancement&lt;/strong&gt; option refines details, making the picture more detailed and also requiring more video memory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months, I had intended to review the installation steps and explain more basic concepts, but it turns out that for ordinary people using AI image generation, it really just involves adjusting parameters based on images provided by experts or re-rendering existing images in a formatted way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried using AI to generate UI assets for a mini-program, but after all that effort, the results weren&amp;rsquo;t satisfactory. It’s better if I just pull the resource images directly from the official mini-program.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Don&#39;t try to fight against hardware in program optimization</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/program-optimization-dont-fight-hardware/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 16:30:15 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One loop thread, the time consumption is already at the &lt;strong&gt;microsecond&lt;/strong&gt; level. We switched servers, and the backlog of data packets went from a maximum of six hundred thousand to almost none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a single-threaded loop processing data scenario, the CPU&amp;rsquo;s performance depends on factors such as clock speed, cache size, and instruction set architecture. Generally speaking, CPUs with higher clock speeds, larger caches, and more advanced instruction set architectures perform better when handling data in a single thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;single-threaded&#34;&gt;Single-threaded
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance improvements don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily require increasing threads; it’s better to streamline project workflows, identify bottlenecks, and determine if single-threaded operation is sufficient. Single-threading also involves fewer considerations and is less prone to issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting off by talking about adding threads, there&amp;rsquo;s definitely something wrong with that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;event&#34;&gt;Event
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dealing with &lt;strong&gt;market data, latency-sensitive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worked overtime all night, releasing a new optimized version. Tested the local interface stripping, and the speed is decent, TPS: 42,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployed to the server, TPS plummeted: 21,000. Tried on a desktop at home, TPS: 79,000. Started suspecting there might be some issues with the group&amp;rsquo;s service virtual machines, initially suspecting it’s due to frequency. The biggest difference between the CPU of the home desktop and the server is the frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, in terms of core count and clock speed, the Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4807 @ 1.87GHz has 6 physical cores and 12 logical cores with a clock speed of 1.87GHz; while the Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 v3 @ 2.60GHz has 8 physical cores and 16 logical cores with a clock speed of 2.60GHz. Therefore, in terms of core count and clock speed, the E5-2640 v3 should have an advantage over the E7-4807 when processing data in single thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, in terms of cache size, the E7-4807 has a 12MB cache, while the E5-2640 v3 has a 20MB cache. Therefore, the E5-2640 v3 offers more cache space, which can improve data access speed and cache hit rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, regarding the architecture, the E5-2640 v3 uses a more advanced Haswell architecture, while the E7-4807 uses the older Nehalem architecture. The Haswell architecture offers performance improvements over the Nehalem architecture, which may also impact the performance of the E5-2640 v3 when processing data in single thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, considering all factors, in scenarios where data is processed in a single-threaded loop, the E5-2640 v3 should offer better performance than the E7-4807. However, specific performance differences will be affected by various factors, including the data processing algorithm, memory bandwidth, system load, and so on; each case requires individual analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/prompt-engineer/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2023 20:46:53 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/prompt-engineer/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as we learned techniques for using search engines back in the day, we also need to learn some techniques for communicating with AI – providing reasonable and sufficient constraints to efficiently obtain the answers we need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at it from a different angle, the current AI is like a child with excellent memory; it has the ability to remember everything and can copy homework. What we need to do is learn how to communicate with AI correctly and effectively, describe our needs precisely, and help AI generate the expected results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;popular-science&#34;&gt;Popular science
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; that bursts forth like a shooting star, more accurately known as &lt;code&gt;Generative Pre-Training&lt;/code&gt;, translates literally to generative pre-training. It is a text generation deep learning model trained on internet-available data and used for tasks such as question answering, text summarization, machine translation, classification, code generation, and conversational AI. There are currently different versions of the model, including GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4, each version being larger and more powerful than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-it-really-have-intelligence&#34;&gt;Does it really have intelligence?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The higher the similarity, the higher the accuracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic, repetitive tasks no longer require human intervention after specific training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is a technology that utilizes existing data such as text, audio, and images to create new content. It can be used for various tasks including text generation, speech synthesis, image generation, and dialogue systems. The logic of generative AI depends on its training data and model structure. Generally speaking, generative AI can follow grammar, logic, and common sense to a certain extent, but it may also produce errors, biases, or untrue content. Therefore, the output of generative AI requires human judgment and verification and should not be blindly trusted or used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt-engineer&#34;&gt;Prompt Engineer
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river of time doesn&amp;rsquo;t flow backward; people need to learn to adapt to the trend. You can think of &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; as not intelligent, lacking logic, and often producing unusable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at it from a different angle, the current AI is like a child with excellent memory; it has the ability to remember everything and can copy homework. What we need to do is learn how to communicate with AI correctly and effectively, describe our needs precisely, and help AI generate the expected results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dialogue-mode&#34;&gt;Dialogue mode
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years after &lt;code&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/code&gt; was released, no one could have predicted that two years later, &lt;code&gt;OpenAI&lt;/code&gt; would emerge, allowing humans to recognize the capabilities of large language models&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;strong&gt;annotation-based programming&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;dialogue-based programming&lt;/strong&gt;, the interactive logic is completely different. Dialogue&amp;rsquo;s pattern provides a user-friendly interaction experience for novice users. It must be mentioned that &lt;code&gt;NewBing&lt;/code&gt; offers follow-up prompts after each question, with Microsoft attempting to guide users to obtain more content from the &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;for-example&#34;&gt;For example
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-speed train journey is long, and coding is a good option. With limited data, processing several images and obtaining image resources is fine, but downloading software to process them would be a bit extravagant, and the network conditions don&amp;rsquo;t allow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a batch of image assets with transparent backgrounds to be used as navigation bar icons for a mini-program. The selected state should be in color, and the unselected state should be black and white. The original assets are all in color and need some preprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a Python code to read all images from a folder, convert them to black and white, maintain the transparent background, optimize the image quality when saving to reduce file size, and display the comparison of the file sizes before and after optimization in the console&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# 导入必要的库
import os
import PIL
from PIL import Image

# 定义一个函数，将图片转换成黑白，维持透明背景，保存图片，并返回文件体积
def convert_and_save(image_file):
    # 打开图片
    image = Image.open(image_file)
    # 获取图片的模式，如果是 RGBA 模式，说明有透明背景
    mode = image.mode
    if mode == &amp;quot;RGBA&amp;quot;:
        # 创建一个和图片大小一致的白色背景图片
        background = Image.new(&amp;quot;RGB&amp;quot;, image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        # 将原图片粘贴到白色背景上，忽略透明像素
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
        # 将合成的图片转换成灰度模式
        gray_image = background.convert(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
        # 将灰度图片再转换成 RGBA 模式，以便保留透明背景
        final_image = gray_image.convert(&amp;quot;RGBA&amp;quot;)
    else:
        # 如果不是 RGBA 模式，直接将图片转换成灰度模式
        final_image = image.convert(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
    # 获取原图片的文件名和扩展名
    file_name, file_ext = os.path.splitext(image_file)
    # 定义新图片的文件名，添加 _bw 后缀表示黑白
    new_file_name = file_name + &amp;quot;_bw&amp;quot; + file_ext
    # 保存新图片，并优化质量，减少文件体积
    final_image.save(new_file_name, optimize=True)
    # 获取原图片和新图片的文件体积，并返回
    old_size = os.path.getsize(image_file)
    new_size = os.path.getsize(new_file_name)
    return old_size, new_size

# 定义一个文件夹路径，存放所有的图片
folder_path = &amp;quot;images&amp;quot;
# 遍历文件夹中的所有文件
for file in os.listdir(folder_path):
    # 拼接完整的文件路径
    file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file)
    # 判断是否是图片文件，根据扩展名判断，可以根据需要添加或修改扩展名
    if file_path.endswith((&amp;quot;.png&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.jpg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.jpeg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.gif&amp;quot;)):
        # 调用函数，转换并保存图片，并获取文件体积
        old_size, new_size = convert_and_save(file_path)
        # 在控制台展示优化前后的文件体积大小对比
        print(f&amp;quot;{file}: {old_size} bytes -&amp;gt; {new_size} bytes&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI quickly provided an answer, it looks good and works fine, but experienced programmers will find the code below not very general and unsuitable for production environments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parameters are fixed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no log files; the information is printed to the console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image processing tasks are suitable for multithreaded models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NewBing is here, following prompts, and selected a question: &lt;strong&gt;Are there any areas for improvement in this code?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this answer completely exceeded expectations. The AI provided corresponding suggestions for optimizations that a typical programmer would think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;这段代码可能还有一些可以改进的地方，比如：

可以使用 argparse 库，让用户可以通过命令行参数指定文件夹路径和扩展名，而不是写死在代码里。
可以使用 logging 库，记录程序的运行情况，而不是直接打印到控制台。
可以使用 try-except 语句，捕获可能出现的异常，比如文件打开失败，图片转换失败等，并做相应的处理。
可以使用 multiprocessing 库，利用多核处理器，加速图片的转换和保存过程。
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very friendly response, considering the differences in deployment environments, supporting single-process execution is permitted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;当然，我很乐意帮你修改一下代码。我尝试添加了 argparse, logging 和 try-except 语句，但没有添加 multiprocessing 库，因为我不确定你的电脑是否支持多核处理。修改后的代码如下：

    # Windows 需要这个函数的原因是 Windows 缺乏 fork() 函数（这不完全正确）。
    # 因此，在 Windows 上，fork() 是通过创建一个新的进程来模拟的，这个新的进程中运行的代码，在 Linux 上是在子进程中运行的。
    # 由于这些代码要在技术上无关的进程中运行，所以它必须在运行之前被传递到那里。
    # 传递的方式是先将它们序列化，然后通过管道从原始进程发送到新的进程。
    # 另外，这个新的进程被通知它必须运行通过管道传递的代码，通过向它传递 --multiprocessing-fork 命令行参数。
    # 如果你看一下 freeze_support() 函数的实现，它的任务是检查它运行在哪个进程中，是否应该运行通过管道传递的代码
    multiprocessing.freeze_support()

    # 创建一个进程池，根据电脑的核心数自动分配进程

        file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file)

        if any(file_path.endswith(ext) for ext in extensions):
            # 调用函数，转换并保存图片，并获取文件体积，使用异步方式，不阻塞主进程
            result = pool.apply_async(convert_and_save, args=(file_path,), callback=print_result)
            # 将结果对象添加到列表中
            results.append((file, result))
    # 关闭进程池，不再接受新的任务
    pool.close()
    # 等待所有的任务完成
    pool.join()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because local development is on a &lt;code&gt;Windows&lt;/code&gt; system, the AI&amp;rsquo;s initial answer didn&amp;rsquo;t include a &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function or &lt;code&gt;multiprocessing.freeze_support&lt;/code&gt;. The code was fixed by tracing the error messages that occurred through follow-up questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as we learned techniques for using search engines back in the day, we also need to learn some techniques for communicating with AI – providing reasonable and sufficient constraints to efficiently obtain the answers we need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: &lt;strong&gt;If you are a programming novice and have any questions about the code based on the comments, feel free to ask for clarification.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>WeChat Mini Program Background and Development Environment</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wechat-mini-program-background-and-development-environment/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 21:59:11 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wechat-mini-program-background-and-development-environment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction to and Preparation for WeChat Mini Programs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-wechat-mini-programs-exist&#34;&gt;Why do WeChat mini programs exist?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A better experience: Slow loading of embedded webpages, white screens; Native app experiences offer faster loading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standards and Management: For WeChat, accessing and managing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the release of mini-programs, WeChat released an SDK called JSSDK, which exposed WeChat&amp;rsquo;s native capabilities such as Wechat Pay and cards. However, developers developed based on web development language logic, allowing them to bypass some of WeChat’s regulations. Mini-programs have their own description language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-mini-program&#34;&gt;What is a mini program?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mini programs are applications that can be used without downloading or installing, realizing the dream of apps being readily accessible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can open the application by scanning a QR code or searching for it, which also embodies the &amp;ldquo;use and leave&amp;rdquo; concept&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about whether they have installed too many applications. Applications will be everywhere, readily available, but without the need for installation or uninstallation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-difference-between-mini-programs-and-mobile-apps&#34;&gt;The difference between mini-programs and mobile apps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No installation required, doesn&amp;rsquo;t take up memory space, easy to share: scan a code, mini-program card, search&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-mini-programs-do&#34;&gt;What can mini programs do?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content Tools: Zhihu Hot List, Weibo Trending Topics, Mobike, Jinri Toutiao, Tencent Map, Tencent Translate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail: Pinduoduo, JD Shopping, Mogujie, Meili Fresh, Xiaomi Mall, Watson&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games: Jump Jump, Happy Landlord, Happy Mahjong, Douyu Live Streaming, YY Live Streaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course content is from 2018, and now some of the application vendors have already gone out of business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;development-preparation&#34;&gt;Development preparation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registering a mini-program account: You can register by filling in the information normally, and activate your account by clicking on the activation link in the email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in to the Mini Program Management Console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfect/Complete Mini Program Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binding Developer: For individual developers, the WeChat account used for login is the administrator account and does not require any additional binding operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email addresses have certain limitations, so a new email address is needed. QQ email allows for aliases, and the WeChat backend doesn&amp;rsquo;t verify them. I tried it out, but changing the name of the mini-program is tricky; anything involving trademarks tends to fail during review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service categories can be selected, or you can add your own; a mini-program can include five categories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view the applet’s &lt;code&gt;ID&lt;/code&gt; information and enable message push notifications within settings. Enabling message push notifications allows you to use message template functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;developer-tools-a-personal-account&#34;&gt;Developer Tools (A Personal Account)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The download and installation are normal, with no special notes. A quick understanding is sufficient; you can directly enter in visitor mode. If you want to enable phone debugging, which allows viewing the development version of the mini-program on your phone, you need to log in to the mini-program developer account and then click on settings, switch to the specified mini-program &lt;code&gt;ID&lt;/code&gt; within project details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-structure&#34;&gt;Code structure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JS: Interaction logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON: Data Configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WXML: The elements of the interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wxss: Styles for the interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

        <title>The office relocation caused server inaccessibility</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/office-migration-server-unavailable/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 01:42:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/office-migration-server-unavailable/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Administrative notice, office relocation. Moving from the original second floor to the fifteenth floor, a routine desk move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sense-of-design&#34;&gt;Sense of design
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office building&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;migration&#34;&gt;Migration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packing up and moving on, setting up a new workstation, adjusting computer cables, and starting work in a comfortable position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no! I connected the network cable, but the server commonly used by our group is inaccessible. I tried switching to a wireless network and it works fine again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought it was a server network segment configuration issue. The wired network of the new workstation wasn&amp;rsquo;t on the firewall’s configured list, and contacting IT colleagues to make adjustments should have resolved it. However, this network segment hosts more than one server, and accessing other servers worked fine. This gradually raised my suspicions. Professional matters should be handled by professionals. Eventually, the operations team identified that because this server had &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; deployed, there was a conflict between the default Docker network &lt;code&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; and the network segment configured for the office’s wired network. As a result, data packets sent to the server received no response and were routed to the &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other servers don&amp;rsquo;t have &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; deployed, so it’s just this one that I use frequently. I occasionally deploy some test services using containers, and never expected to encounter this situation. Thinking about it more carefully, since the entire group is in the same office building, and the IT department divided network segments using addresses starting with &lt;code&gt;172&lt;/code&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker0&#34;&gt;docker0
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;# vim /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
    &amp;quot;bip&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;172.200.0.1/24&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart the service, switch to the new network, and the server will return to normal access&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Embedded Entry 1 - Professional Terms</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/embedded-introduction-professional-terms/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 13:42:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/embedded-introduction-professional-terms/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mentioning embedded systems, what comes to mind are still the 51 microcontrollers and Freescale from my school lab days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LPA3399Pro is a visual host developed on the Rockchip RK3399Pro platform, designed for portable computing hosts requiring extensive vision processing scenarios. It features an integrated NPU computing unit with 3.0 TOPS of computing power and supports various algorithm models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RV1109 is Realtek&amp;rsquo;s AI-specific machine vision SoC branch, featuring an integrated independent NPU. RV1109 can provide 1 TOPS of computing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;system-on-chip&#34;&gt;System on Chip
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoC is an abbreviation for &amp;ldquo;System on a Chip,&amp;rdquo; meaning &amp;ldquo;on-chip system.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a technology that integrates multiple electronic systems onto a single chip. This technology can significantly reduce the size and weight of electronic products while improving performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoCs (System on a Chip) and CPUs (Central Processing Units) are both important components of computer systems, but there are some differences between them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPU is the core processor in a computer system, responsible for executing program instructions. It typically includes only basic components such as an arithmetic unit, control unit, and registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoCs integrate multiple electronic systems onto a single chip, and in addition to including a CPU, they can also incorporate other components such as memory, graphics processors, and input/output interfaces. This significantly reduces the size and weight of electronic products while improving performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, a CPU is a component of an SoC, while an SoC is a more complex and highly integrated electronic system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;microcontroller-unit&#34;&gt;Microcontroller Unit
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoC (System on a Chip) and MCU (Microcontroller Unit) are technologies that integrate multiple electronic systems onto a single chip, but there are some differences between them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MCU is a microcontroller, typically including basic components such as a CPU, memory, and input/output interfaces. It is commonly used to control other electronic devices, such as home appliances and automotive electronics systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoCs integrate more electronic systems onto a single chip, including basic components like MCUs and other elements such as graphics processors and wireless communication modules. This significantly reduces the size and weight of electronic products while improving performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, an MCU is a simple microcontroller, while a SoC is a more complex and highly integrated electronic system&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>AI-assisted programming, an evolution of productivity</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-assisted-programming-productivity-evolution/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 17:05:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-assisted-programming-productivity-evolution/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;GitHub Copilot was released less than two years ago, and then ChatGPT appeared. I don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand the underlying principles, but I’ve used both for a while. The two tools offer completely different levels of assistance, but they both significantly improve productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very complex things, AI still can&amp;rsquo;t do. After all, they lack logic; things that are routine or have a fixed paradigm, if the training data is sufficient, AI can achieve about 90% effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-copilot&#34;&gt;github copilot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it was released, looking at the demo introduction on the official website, it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem very smart, and after trying it out, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very usable, so I gave up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 2022, when I had nothing else to do, I switched to the new version to try it out, and the effect is already pretty good. The only problem is that the speed in China is a bit slow, probably due to network issues. Code written based on comments using languages like &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; is quite decent; it&amp;rsquo;s much faster than looking up information myself and writing code from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chatgpt&#34;&gt;ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub Copilot is still designed from a programmer&amp;rsquo;s, or developer&amp;rsquo;s, perspective. You need to understand how to program and gradually guide the AI with comments to assist in programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT has reached the next level, &lt;strong&gt;making it easy for even non-experts to get started&lt;/strong&gt;. With its conversational and interactive design, you can freely ask questions, describe your needs, and continue asking if there&amp;rsquo;s anything you don&amp;rsquo;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you understand the concept of tokenization but don&amp;rsquo;t know how to code it, and want to calculate string similarity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;Python 分词计算 維天運通 LOGORY 和 合肥維天運通信息科技股份有限公司 两个字符串的相似度；
比较前，统一处理字符串，英文转换为小写；
第二个字符中如果能找到第一个字符的首字符，将第二个字符串截位，截位的长度为第一个字符串的长度
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, this is Bing. 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to online information 123, Python tokenization can be implemented using the jieba library. The jieba library supports three segmentation modes: precise mode, full mode, and search engine mode. You can choose the appropriate mode based on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare the similarity of two strings, you first need to tokenize them and then calculate indicators such as word vectors or edit distance. You can use libraries like NumPy or SciPy for mathematical operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To uniformly handle strings, converting them to lowercase can be achieved using Python&amp;rsquo;s built-in function lower()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extract the second string, you can use Python&amp;rsquo;s slicing operator []&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a possible code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import jieba
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

# 定义两个字符串
str1 = &amp;quot;維天運通 LOGORY&amp;quot;
str2 = &amp;quot;合肥維天運通信息科技股份有限公司&amp;quot;

# 统一处理字符串，英文转换为小写
str1 = str1.lower()
str2 = str2.lower()

# 找到第二个字符串中第一个字符的位置
index = str2.find(str1[0])

# 如果找到了，截取第二个字符串
if index != -1:
    str2 = str2[index:index+len(str1)]

# 使用 jieba 库进行分词
words1 = list(jieba.cut(str1))
words2 = list(jieba.cut(str2))

# 计算两个字符串的词向量（以词频作为权重）
vector1 = np.zeros(len(words1))
vector2 = np.zeros(len(words1))

for i, word in enumerate(words1):
    vector1[i] += 1 # 统计第一个字符串中每个词出现的次数
    if word in words2:
        vector2[i] += 1 # 统计第二个字符串中每个词出现的次数

# 计算两个字符串的相似度（以余弦距离作为指标）
similarity = 1 - cosine(vector1, vector2)

print(&amp;quot;两个字符串的相似度是：&amp;quot;, similarity)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take it a step further, I consulted the results of the run and congratulated you on discovering a problem – the results were fabricated. It didn&amp;rsquo;t actually execute any code but gave a decent result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chestnuts&#34;&gt;Chestnuts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question: SQL statement, retrieve records from the product code table where the product codes are within the range of 80000-89999&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;你好，这是 Bing。😊

根据搜索结果12，你可以使用 SQL BETWEEN 运算符来选择给定区间内的值。BETWEEN 运算符包含了开始和结束的值。

你需要先指定要查询的表名和列名，然后在 WHERE 子句中使用 BETWEEN 运算符和区间值。

例如，如果你要查询产品代码表中，产品代码在 80000 到 89999 之间的记录，你可以使用以下语句：

SELECT * FROM product_code
WHERE code BETWEEN 80000 AND 89999;
这里，* 表示选择所有列3。如果你只想选择特定的列，比如产品名称和价格，你可以用逗号分隔它们，如下：

SELECT name, price FROM product_code
WHERE code BETWEEN 80000 AND 89999;
希望这能帮助到你。
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep asking, negate it: The product code is a string, your code is wrong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;抱歉，我没有注意到产品代码是字符串。如果是这样的话，你需要在区间值两边加上单引号，如下：

SELECT * FROM product_code
WHERE code BETWEEN &#39;80000&#39; AND &#39;89999&#39;;
请原谅我的错误。🙏
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, it will make a mistake&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Hong Kong dollar and Renminbi dual counter model</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hk-rmb-dual-counter-mode/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 20:25:47 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hk-rmb-dual-counter-mode/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing announced on December 13 that its securities market will soon launch a “dual currency trading model” (hereinafter referred to as the &amp;ldquo;dual counter model&amp;rdquo;) and a dual counter designated participant mechanism, further supporting the listing, trading, and settlement of Renminbi counters in Hong Kong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dual-counter-model-and-dual-counter-bookmaker-mechanism&#34;&gt;Dual counter model and dual counter bookmaker mechanism
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Stock Exchange says that after regulatory approval and market readiness, the registration process for various new measures is expected to begin in the first half of 2023. Under the dual-counter model, the exchange will optimize related trading and settlement arrangements so that investors can switch between Hong Kong dollar counter and Renminbi counter securities issued by the same issuer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance the liquidity of the Renminbi counter and narrow the spread between the two counters, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing will introduce a dual-counter market maker mechanism. After relevant legislation is passed by the Legislative Council, market makers engaged in providing liquidity can be exempted from stamp duty when conducting specific transactions. At the same time, these new measures will also prepare for subsequent mainland investors trading securities priced in Renminbi through Stock Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of a Hong Kong dollar-RMB dual counter model and dual counter market maker mechanism is an important measure for our market development. Coupled with our other market initiatives, this arrangement will help attract more dual-counter securities to list in Hong Kong and create good synergy with the Exchange’s existing mainland products. “Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing is committed to actively promoting the internationalization of RMB and continuously enhancing Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s position as a leading global offshore RMB center,” said Calvyn Yao, Chief Operating Officer and Head of Markets at HKEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is understood that the existing listing, trading, clearing and settlement arrangements for Hong Kong stocks will also generally apply to Renminbi counter securities under the dual-counter model. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange will announce the implementation date of the dual-counter model and the list of eligible dual-counter securities that meet the requirements for inclusion in the designated participant mechanism in due course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-identify-hong-kong-dollar-rmb-exchange-counters&#34;&gt;How to identify Hong Kong dollar-RMB exchange counters
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to documents from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the arrangement for dual currency (Hong Kong dollar-Renminbi) trading will generally follow the existing stock code allocation plan. Stocks on the Hong Kong dollar counter will have 5-digit codes starting with &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo;, while stocks on the Renminbi counter will have 5-digit codes starting with &amp;ldquo;8&amp;rdquo;. The last four digits of the stock codes for both Hong Kong dollar and Renminbi counters will be the same. Stock short names on the Renminbi counter will be suffixed with &amp;ldquo;-R&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding trading arrangements, based on the premise that securities in Renminbi and Hong Kong dollar counters are of the same category and can be converted to each other, if one counter (e.g., Hong Kong dollar counter) is designated for short selling, the other counter (e.g., Renminbi counter) can also be included as designated for short selling according to exchange rules; accordingly, both counters will appear on the list of designated securities for short selling published by the exchange&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the stocks of the two counters belong to the same category and are convertible, both buying or holding in Hong Kong dollars and selling in Renminbi, or vice versa, will be regarded as a round-trip transaction. The settlement time between the two counters is T+2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short selling of specified stocks, such as borrowing shares in Hong Kong currency and then selling them on the RMB counter, will be considered a guaranteed short sale, and vice versa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that under the dual currency counter model, physical stock deposits and withdrawals are not available for RMB counters as they are solely used for trading and settlement. Physical stocks can only be deposited at Hong Kong dollar counters before being converted to RMB counters. Similarly, physical stocks can only be withdrawn after conversion from RMB counters to Hong Kong dollar counters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees for related transactions, settlement and delivery, as well as all Hong Kong clearing fees, are calculated and charged in Hong Kong dollars, except for dividend collection service fees and interest collection service fees, which are calculated based on the qualified currency adopted by the relevant securities&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Compiler, callback function, performance testing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/compiler-callback-function-performance-testing/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 13:59:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/compiler-callback-function-performance-testing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, we designed an SDK that handles event encapsulation and provides a class interface. During service initialization, the caller implements the corresponding class and passes the object pointer to the module.
Having experience with &lt;code&gt;C11&lt;/code&gt;, driven by curiosity, I wondered what the results would be if these interfaces were implemented using &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; function objects as callbacks compared to defining interfaces with pure virtual functions – it seems more flexible
Questions then arose: which grammar is faster from a performance perspective? Without understanding compiler principles, let&amp;rsquo;s just try some code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An online URL that allows you to choose different compilers, compilation parameters, run code on the &lt;code&gt;Linux&lt;/code&gt; platform, or view the corresponding assembly code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s convenient to run small code snippets on a webpage for technical verification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Godbolt.org uses different colors to distinguish the code corresponding to different assembly, making it easier to view than a local debugger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standards committee defines the rules of grammar. How to implement this at the compilation level depends on each compiler. I have to say, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s compilers are quite impressive. Syntactic sugar isn&amp;rsquo;t all-powerful; with fewer callback interfaces, &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; is more convenient and eliminates the need to define empty callback function interfaces. When there are many types of callback interfaces, traditional virtual functions are more beneficial for unifying business interface definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both perform similarly on the Windows platform, with little difference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison of virtual functions and lambda expressions on the &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt; platform, a difference of 1.35 ns per execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In typical business system development, this level of performance loss can be ignored. Introducing &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; brings more convenience in design. This is particularly noticeable when designing multi-signal processing scenarios. With event triggers at the bottom layer and a need to persist logs, the handling function for entering and exiting log objects is involved. When more business processing interfaces are required, a &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; stores &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; objects at the bottom layer. Upon event triggering, they are traversed and invoked sequentially, similar to signals and slots in &lt;code&gt;QT&lt;/code&gt;. This allows for complete decoupling between logging, monitoring, business 1, and business 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are two new modes, ordinary functions and emulated functions. There&amp;rsquo;s a significant performance difference—on the order of magnitude—between using interface callbacks and direct calls. Emulated function performance is close to that of regular functions, and sometimes even better. This area (compiler principles) is a knowledge blind spot for me. My guess is that it’s due to the fact that the variables accessed and the function are located next to each other in memory, which benefits CPU processing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Host order, network order, observe directly through a debugger</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/host-order-network-order-debugger-observation/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 14:18:12 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/host-order-network-order-debugger-observation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the history of computer development, there has not been a unified standard for how to store data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two common rules for arranging bytes. For example, if the low-order digits of a multi-digit number are placed at smaller addresses and the high-order digits are placed at larger addresses, it is called little-endian; otherwise, it is called big-endian. In network applications, byte order is a factor that must be considered because different machine types may adopt different standards, so they are all converted according to the network standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following reading habits, big-endian byte order is more consistent with the left-to-right reading sequence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;processor-architecture&#34;&gt;Processor architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processors such as x86, MOS Technology 6502, Z80, VAX, and PDP-11 are little-endian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processors such as Motorola 6800, Motorola 68000, and PowerPC 970 are big-endian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The byte order is configurable for ARM, PowerPC (except PowerPC 970), DEC Alpha, SPARC V9, MIPS, PA-RISC, and IA64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;network-preface&#34;&gt;Network Preface
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network transmission generally uses big-endian order, also known as network byte order or network order. Big-endian is defined as the network byte order in the IP protocol.
Berkeley sockets define a set of conversion functions for converting between network byte order and host byte order for 16- and 32-bit integers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;arpa/inet.h&amp;gt;

uint32_t htonl(uint32_t hostlong); //把uint32_t类型从主机序转换到网络序
uint16_t htons(uint16_t hostshort); //把uint16_t类型从主机序转换到网络序
uint32_t ntohl(uint32_t netlong); //把uint32_t类型从网络序转换到主机序
uint16_t ntohs(uint16_t netshort); //把uint16_t类型从网络序转换到主机序
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you choose &lt;code&gt;asio&lt;/code&gt; as your networking library, there are cross-platform compatible function names in the built-in namespace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::host_to_network_long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::host_to_network_short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio-debugger&#34;&gt;Visual Studio debugger
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In debug mode, select the Debug menu, then Window, and check Memory Window&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/code&gt;, you can directly view data in memory within the debugger, as shown in the figure below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debugger Menu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-check-memory&#34;&gt;How to check memory
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prints the variable name directly in the window and jumps to its corresponding address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the variable is already a pointer, double-click on the variable, drag it to the memory window, and display the contents at that address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the variable is not a pointer, add it to the calculation window, get its address, and then manually copy it to the memory window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Received a data segment, stored in the &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt; object, converted from network byte order to host byte order, resulting in &lt;code&gt;body_length&lt;/code&gt; equal to 30. The server has allocated four bytes for transmitting this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;bool NetworkMessage::decode_header()
{
    // 网络序转成主机序
    body_length_ = boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_long(*(int *)buffer_.data());

        <title>That young man, perhaps had some talent, but not much</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been seven years since I started working, and the positive feedback from writing code isn&amp;rsquo;t as much as it used to be. Looking back on how I got on this &amp;ldquo;coding&amp;rdquo; path.
The more choices a person makes, especially when they are young, the more they tend to follow positive feedback, actively avoiding harm and seeking benefit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-childhood&#34;&gt;I. Childhood
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving to the city, encountering computer books? Hacker materials? Becoming familiar with the Windows system? These are all later stories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be transported back to when I was a kid, sneaking around with my cousin using our family&amp;rsquo;s computer to play games; my cousin’s uncle ran a shop in the computer district
We started using computers relatively early on, so we developed a basic understanding of them. Later, in school and during computer classes, I also had quite an interest.
I heard about the computer competitions in junior high school, and thought they were really cool. After transferring schools, that matter was put on hold.
When I was in junior high, I was familiar with basic computer operations and could easily stand out during computer class
If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with it, yes, you haven&amp;rsquo;t mistaken yourself, not skilled, but familiar with Microsoft Office software, that would be even more impressive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;moving&#34;&gt;Moving
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the moving situation, once I got into the city, due to my neighbors, I came into contact with the library. Although I read a lot of novels, I also read many magazines.
Computer News, Popular Software
I&amp;rsquo;ve become increasingly interested in computers, and as a child I had a great admiration for hackers, actively learning related knowledge at school
Understanding the basics of operating systems: Control Panel, CMD commands, VBS scripts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Computer World&amp;rdquo; magazine&amp;rsquo;s beginner-friendly content is quite suitable; it always uses case studies to explain system operations
《Popular Software》recommends various software, industry news, &lt;strong&gt;and of course, game news; the initial motivation also planted the seeds for games.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-high-school&#34;&gt;Three. High School
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was in my second year of high school, &lt;strong&gt;Boge transferred to our class; several senior students had been directly admitted through the computer competition for the previous two years&lt;/strong&gt;, and the school leaders also valued this competition
There&amp;rsquo;s also a foundational hardware aspect; an alumnus of ours donated a building to the school, a new library, a new computer lab – it’s all so coincidental
With Bo’s popular science explanation, he would be considered a computer expert in the class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A top student with computer skills, knowing how to hack into other people&amp;rsquo;s computers and disable surveillance software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition, despite its challenges, made it to the finals. I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully understand everything, and the questions were mostly about basic algorithms, but I did gain some insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s still just half a bucket of water, it’s like taking a trip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-college&#34;&gt;Four, College
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came time to choose a major in college, I listened to my family and chose automation, but what I really wanted was to study high-voltage electricity. After returning home, I entered the power supply bureau, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn much from my coursework.
Self-directed learning ability is practically non-existent in professional courses, but when it comes to computer science courses in large lectures, I find them very easy and natural&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipping required courses, studying computer science diligently, and spending my days on forums like &amp;ldquo;Jingyi Forum&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;52PoP.&amp;rdquo;
Combining my knowledge of assembly and C++ from my studies, I started earning money by taking on projects from forums. It&amp;rsquo;s been going well, with increasing positive feedback, and it’s gotten to the point where it’s difficult to turn back.
In the end, Xiao Professional chose to write code for chips; my family didn&amp;rsquo;t interfere much and let me choose myself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, &lt;strong&gt;the third key figure: Tangge&lt;/strong&gt;, with a high level of education, joined Baidu
My older sister understands me; she knows I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a state of mind to think and research, so she told me to talk it over with my cousin
Figure out the development path for next steps, don&amp;rsquo;t go home for summer vacation, stay with the mentor and work on projects to gain experience
Relied on a still-decent transcript, I got into Hengan Electronic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;five-graduation&#34;&gt;Five, Graduation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a key point, I know I took courses on wall-climbing and elective subjects: Computer Information Retrieval, knowing how to quickly find and locate materials and problems
A helpful person appeared at work, &lt;strong&gt;Shuo&lt;/strong&gt;, who gave me time to learn on my own, troubleshoot and get to the root of problems, and introduced me to the experts at the R&amp;amp;D center
This also laid the groundwork; Shenzhen Branch believes I&amp;rsquo;m very capable, and I successfully took responsibility for the transaction channel team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where the problem lies; I have a lack of foundational knowledge in areas like computer operating systems, algorithms, and software engineering design
It&amp;rsquo;s all based on my own historical experience, not systematic learning
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to make mistakes, constantly revising and negating previous code designs, lacking a guiding principle for module design. After seven years, I’m starting to feel burnt out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>China&#39;s COVID-19 lifting of restrictions</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-coronavirus-unlocking/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 19:22:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-coronavirus-unlocking/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The policy was announced very suddenly and implemented quickly; health codes are no longer required, nor are they checked at public venues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browsing the New York Times Chinese website, the entire layout is discussing China reopening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not evaluate policies, just record what is happening around you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing never had a &amp;ldquo;clearance&amp;rdquo; in the first place. With the opening of restrictions, it spread rapidly, with widespread infections. Among my friends, no one has experienced severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shenzhen, bordering Guangzhou, has also begun to develop rapidly; I&amp;rsquo;m based in Shanghai, but due to my company being near the suburbs, there hasn’t been widespread infection yet when I’m writing this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protective measures in my hometown were inadequate, leading to widespread diffusion afterward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels roughly the same as before, suddenly loosening up, with a new policy every week until it was fully opened&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;rsquo;t be denied that the three-year zero-COVID policy had an effect, fostering a sense of acceptance and going with the flow&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>C11: sleep for vs yield</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/c11-sleep-for-vs-yield/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 20:54:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/c11-sleep-for-vs-yield/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While reviewing the code, &lt;code&gt;std::this_thread::yield()&lt;/code&gt; suddenly caught my eye – a syntactic sugar feature from &lt;code&gt;C11&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve used quite a bit of it, but this is the first time seeing &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt;, and I hadn’t noticed it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without checking the manual, my first thought was whether it&amp;rsquo;s related to asynchrony. The word &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; is used in the coroutine implementation of the Boost library, but this definitely has nothing to do with coroutines here; the control logic is likely related to ordinary threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;document&#34;&gt;Document
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;yield&#34;&gt;yield
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accuracy of this function depends on the implementation, particularly the OS scheduler mechanism and system state in use. For example, a first-in, first-out real-time scheduler (SCHED_FIFO in Linux) will suspend the current thread and place it at the tail of the queue of threads with the same priority (and yield has no effect if there are no other threads at the same priority).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sleep_for&#34;&gt;sleep_for
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocks the current thread&amp;rsquo;s execution for at least the specified sleep_duration
This function may block for longer than sleep_duration due to scheduling delays or resource contention
The standard library recommends measuring duration using a stable clock. If implemented with system time, wait times may also be sensitive to clock adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are both functions designed to release the current thread, and the effect depends on the platform? Still a bit hazy here, let&amp;rsquo;s run the code to see the execution results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThinkPad laptop (Visual Studio Community Edition 2022), Tencent Cloud S2 standard server (gcc8.5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Operating Platform&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Function&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;First Time/μs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Second Time/μs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Third Time/μs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Windows&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;sleep_for&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9872&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1884&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11302&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Windows&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yield&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;119&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Linux&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;sleep_for&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;171&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;168&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;167&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Linux&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yield&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;101&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;102&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;101&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand from the execution results that there are huge differences in the stability of &lt;code&gt;sleep_for&lt;/code&gt; at high precision due to different operating system implementations. If you need high-precision sleep, using &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; is more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time precision is increased to &lt;code&gt;ms&lt;/code&gt;, there is no significant difference between them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;chrono&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;thread&amp;gt;
 
// 建议其他线程运行一小段时间的“忙睡眠”
void little_sleep(std::chrono::microseconds us)
{
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    auto end = start + us;
    do {
        std::this_thread::yield();
    } while (std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() &amp;lt; end);
}
 
int main()
{
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
 
    little_sleep(std::chrono::microseconds(100));
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(100));
 
    auto elapsed = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() - start;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;waited for &amp;quot;
              &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::chrono::duration_cast&amp;lt;std::chrono::microseconds&amp;gt;(elapsed).count()
              &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot; microseconds\n&amp;quot;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Resetting MySQL password on a Linux server</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-server-reset-mysql-password/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 14:27:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-server-reset-mysql-password/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have an idle Tencent Cloud server that is due to expire at the end of the year, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t plan on renewing it. I deployed a MySQL database for development purposes. When reinstalling the system, I chose a third-party image provided by Tencent Cloud to save time; it already had the MySQL database installed. I assumed there would be a Readme file or something similar in the system, explaining the password and deployment path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s quick to reinstall the system on Tencent Cloud, it notifies you that it’s been reinstalled in about a minute. I logged in and &lt;code&gt;systemctl status mysql&lt;/code&gt; shows the service has already started. I looked everywhere for the password but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it, and slowly started feeling hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it, I&amp;rsquo;ve already gained access to the server with &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; privileges; there has to be a way to reset the password. I flipped through some documents and found a post on the Alibaba Cloud forum – time to keep troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reset-password&#34;&gt;Reset password
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the configuration file &lt;code&gt;vim /etc/my.cnf&lt;/code&gt;, add the following configuration to the &lt;code&gt;mysqld&lt;/code&gt; node: &lt;code&gt;skip-grant-tables&lt;/code&gt;, and execute the command to restart the data: &lt;code&gt;systemctl restart mysql&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt; to log in to the data again, and then proceed with normal operations. Reset the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; user password and enable remote login as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;USE mysql;
UPDATE user SET authentication_string = password (&#39;pass&#39;) WHERE User = &#39;root&#39;;
grant all privileges on *.* to &#39;root&#39;@&#39;%&#39; identified by &#39;pass&#39; with grant option;
flush privileges;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revert the configuration file, restart the database, and it&amp;rsquo;s done&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Night Naming Technique</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/night-naming-art/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 22:10:14 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/night-naming-art/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the vast system of Chinese characters, the character for “fate” or &amp;ldquo;life&amp;rdquo; (命) is unique, without a single homonym. Perhaps this subtly suggests that each person&amp;rsquo;s life is only lived once, irreplaceable and unrepeatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flipping through the rankings on Qidian Chinese Network during my leisure time, &amp;ldquo;The Naming of Night&amp;rdquo; has an overwhelming lead in monthly votes, firmly holding the top spot and leaving a huge gap between it and second place – practically unattainable. In the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly read works by well-known authors like Tang Jia San Shao and Er Gen, but this time I decided to try out a new author and experience a different reading feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of early August, &amp;ldquo;Naming Night&amp;rdquo; had reached two million monthly tickets, while the second-place novel only had eighty thousand, a staggering difference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;rsquo;m not well-versed enough to evaluate the writing of this book. However, after reading through more than a dozen chapters, the plot is tightly paced and intricately connected, captivating readers. It’s truly deserving of such high monthly votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that, just like the character for &amp;ldquo;destiny&amp;rdquo; (命), the character for &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; (死) also has no homophones in Chinese. Does this perhaps imply that the end of life is equally unique and irreplaceable?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A Brief Discussion on Automated Testing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shallow-discussion-on-automation-testing/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 11:39:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shallow-discussion-on-automation-testing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Investment in testing for financial trading systems far exceeds that of other systems, with tedious testing steps repeated endlessly and a very low ROI. As projects and personnel change, uncontrollable factors are inevitably introduced. A common scenario is modifying a field output by interface A, which unexpectedly affects the result of interface B. With each version release, risks accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theoretical-knowledge&#34;&gt;Theoretical knowledge
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you measure the value of automation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ROI of an automated test case = (Manual execution time) * (Number of executions) / (Development cost + Maintenance cost)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which features need automated testing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features that users commonly use and which don&amp;rsquo;t change frequently. Writing automated test code for this type of interface yields the highest return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why choose this time to promote automated testing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not suitable now, as we approach the project launch. Relying on distant water to quench immediate thirst doesn’t work; automation is a long-term benefit model. The project is already live in the &lt;strong&gt;production environment&lt;/strong&gt; and entering a stable release cycle – this is the most appropriate time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;framework-selection&#34;&gt;Framework Selection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without relevant practical experience, being assigned a task like automation testing is typically approached as follows: open a search engine, look for tools and frameworks compatible with the current system&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;technology stack&lt;/strong&gt;, go through the user manuals, and get started. If you can quickly find a suitable tool, congratulations, a &lt;strong&gt;perfect start&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize first. I checked the relevant materials, and it&amp;rsquo;s not that there isn&amp;rsquo;t any [solution], but rather the framework itself is too complex, and deploying it consumes excessive resources. What beginners need is something compact and streamlined. I consulted with colleagues in the testing team, who suggested building a framework using &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; – essentially encapsulating existing unit testing frameworks into an automated testing framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refer to the design of this project: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/wintests/pytestDemo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/wintests/pytestDemo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-we-need-frameworks&#34;&gt;Why do we need frameworks?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service has multiple deployment environments, including a development environment, a testing environment, and a pre-production testing environment. The framework&amp;rsquo;s role is to provide an abstraction layer, separating test cases and data. It allows for different case data configurations for each environment, while also supporting shared data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core logic is all about improving the utilization of automation. Even if the scenario becomes more complex, and data between different environments is inconsistent and unrelated, simply add a &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; tag when configuring case data to specify the environment supported by the current data.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Why learn other programming languages after having used C++ for over ten years, starting from my school days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work Experience: Lacks experience in elegant module design, C++ syntax is flexible, and learning other languages can help guide the creation of more elegant designs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often find myself using these tools when writing them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the design of the underlying libraries or the implementation of business modules, the design principles are consistent&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Visual Studio character set compilation [transfer]</title>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-compilation-character-set-translation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-platform development in C++ often encounters on Chinese operating systems: &lt;code&gt;error C2001&lt;/code&gt; newline character in constant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio&#34;&gt;visual studio
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CMake organizes project compilation scripts; when developing on the Windows system, it temporarily generates a solution; due to cross-platform reasons, the file encoding is chosen as UTF-8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cited materials provide a detailed explanation of the cause of the problem from a theoretical perspective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding encoding, &lt;code&gt;MSVC&lt;/code&gt; has specific compilation options &lt;code&gt;/source-charset&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/execution-charset&lt;/code&gt;. The former indicates the encoding of the file itself, while the latter indicates what encoding the bytes within the character array are after compilation. Encoding issues can generally be resolved using these two options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt; console in &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; can only display &lt;code&gt;GBK&lt;/code&gt; encoding by default, but the code file itself is &lt;code&gt;UTF-8&lt;/code&gt;. Due to cross-platform compatibility, it&amp;rsquo;s not convenient to directly modify it to &lt;code&gt;GBK&lt;/code&gt;. Of course, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t include methods like writing encoding conversion code for different platforms. On &lt;code&gt;Win10&lt;/code&gt;, you can set these two compilation options to &lt;code&gt;/source-charset:utf-8 /execution-charset:gbk&lt;/code&gt;, which means letting the compiler read in with &lt;code&gt;UTF-8&lt;/code&gt; encoding and then convert it to &lt;code&gt;GBK&lt;/code&gt; and save it in an array, so that &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; can directly display Chinese characters normally on the &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt; console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cmake-settings-for-visual-studio&#34;&gt;CMake settings for Visual Studio

endif()

        <title>Pelosi visits Taiwan</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Not understanding politics, not making comments, just recording this &amp;ldquo;carnival&amp;rdquo; on the internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;random-thoughts&#34;&gt;Random thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tangshan beating incident and the elementary school textbook cultural invasion incident from a while ago, I wonder how many people still remember. These hot topics in the news have become numbing; there&amp;rsquo;s no much feeling, just watching dramas as usual after work, treating it like entertainment. The economic situation is already like this, and an outbreak of war won’t make things better. I don’t understand politics, and I won’t comment on it, just recording this &amp;ldquo;carnival&amp;rdquo; online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview-of-the-2022-sichuanyaan-earthquake&#34;&gt;Overview of the 2022 Sichuan–Ya’an earthquake
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 visit to Taiwan by Nancy Pelosi, often referred to as Pelosi&amp;rsquo;s visit to Taiwan, refers to the trip to Taiwan during a tour of Asian countries by Nancy Pelosi, the 52nd Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the US House of Representatives Speaker being considered the third most powerful figure in the United States and planning a visit to Taiwan, with the date approaching China&amp;rsquo;s People&amp;rsquo;s Liberation Army Foundation Day on August 1st in the short term and the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the 2022 US elections, and the 2022 local elections in Taiwan in the long term, the Chinese government has expressed strong protests. The People&amp;rsquo;s Liberation Army dispatched destroyer formations to the northeast waters of the Taiwan Strait and mobilized two carrier strike groups, Shandong and Liaoning. The Eastern Theater Command and Southern Theater Command conducted large-scale live-fire exercises in the East China Sea and South China Sea respectively. On the US side, the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group has arrived near the Taiwan Strait to protect a possible visit by Pelosi, and multiple batches of reconnaissance aircraft and aerial refueling tankers have been deployed to the US military base at Kadena Air Force Base in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden had a video conference before the visit, which involved the Taiwan issue. Taiwanese and international media reported that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a congressional delegation are expected to arrive at Taipei Songshan Airport on August 2, spend the night there, and meet with Republic of China President Tsai Ing-wen and other high-ranking government officials on August 3. Some observers believe that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan could trigger a new crisis in the Taiwan Strait, the first since the 1996 Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis over two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;08-11&#34;&gt;08-11
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s basically settled today, and the headlines for this period have mostly been about various naval exercises. Zhihu has also been working hard, changing up the way they update the trending topics every day, all talking about this same thing. The editor worked hard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Quickly statistics folder size on Windows platform</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-platform-quick-folder-size-statistics/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Linux platform is very simple; one line of code with &lt;code&gt;du -sh *&lt;/code&gt; gets the job done. What about Windows? With many disks and a desire to clean them up, especially when there are lots of files, the built-in resource manager&amp;rsquo;s folder size statistics are so slow you want to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;everything&#34;&gt;Everything
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers on the Windows platform should have either used or heard of Everything. Its search speed is much faster than the system&amp;rsquo;s built-in File Explorer. Since the operating system supports fast file indexing, there must be similar tools that can establish a file index and also calculate the size of the files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wiztree&#34;&gt;WizTree

&lt;p&gt;Extract and run in standard installation mode or green version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast speed, a variety of data display types, with a tree diagram mode on the left, file types on the right, and of course, graphical displays at the bottom of the software&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software website: [http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation is very simple, select the corresponding disk drive, and the software will display folder sizes in a graphical way. The larger the size, the larger the corresponding matrix in the image. You&amp;rsquo;ll understand the rest with a few clicks. It supports entering conditions to filter files:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Copy Webpage Style Sheets (CSS): Element Inspection</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-copy-webpage-css-element-inspection/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 23:36:48 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The themes for static blogs are mostly based on foreign templates, with modifications and adjustments, without much consideration for the layout of Chinese content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half a month ago, I made some adjustments to the blog&amp;rsquo;s stylesheet. Having worked in backend service development for many years, I’m quite the newbie when it comes to frontend. After fiddling with it all day, the design wasn&amp;rsquo;t very reasonable. Suddenly, I had an idea – remembering the technical blogs I often read: InfoQ and Open Source China, their layouts are really good. Could I borrow some of their ideas? I looked at the source code for a while, trying to locate the relevant elements, but ended up completely confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontend developers seeing this might be laughing&amp;hellip; not understanding how to locate specified elements. It&amp;rsquo;s okay if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand, there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of time on the weekend, so let me pause and think – it seems I used something similar when writing Python crawlers before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;elemental-review&#34;&gt;Elemental Review
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s true, it’s the browser’s built-in element inspection tool – copying style sheets and locating specific elements are done in a flash; &lt;code&gt;selector&lt;/code&gt; locates elements, &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; creates &lt;code&gt;user define css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy outerHTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy selector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy JS path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy Style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy XPath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the complete XPath&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Guoan database incident has been buzzing around in the black market circles, and it&amp;rsquo;s unclear whether it’s true or not. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we remember it in two years and take another look. Based on past experience, a wave of local social engineering database information was updated, and I saw a huge SQL file: 17.9G. A regular text editor would have trouble even previewing it, let alone opening it. While chatting with netizens, someone mentioned: EmEditor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Website: [https://www.emeditor.com/]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried it out during my free time on the weekend, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite convenient. The design supports editing large files, and with sufficient memory, the entire file is loaded into memory, making searching and editing fast. It also supports splitting files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Shanghai Hot Pot Lockdown</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-closure/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 23:03:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-closure/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The leadership team insisted just a couple of days ago that Shanghai wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be locked down, saying it was very important. But now, either pressured by the situation or to protect their own reputations, they’ve taken a cross-river approach. First, they sealed off the area across from Huangpu River for a period, and then they will seal off this side of the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;city-closure&#34;&gt;City closure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had very little memory of SARS as a child, having experienced it back then. Later, when I saw related information, I realized that it ended before widespread diffusion occurred because the incubation period was relatively short. I remember being in elementary school at the time, and we were dismissed early every day. The classroom always smelled of disinfectant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost three years since the COVID-19 pandemic started in late 2019. People working outside their hometowns have gotten used to it, wearing masks when necessary. This wave of the epidemic in Shanghai initially originated from Hong Kong and spread to Shenzhen through cross-border entry points. The situation here in Shanghai was also caused by a series of imported cases from Hong Kong. The authorities finally announced that the outbreak was due to inadequate protective measures at quarantine hotels, leading to the spread of the virus after mutation. While the toxicity of the mutated virus has weakened, its transmission speed has increased through the hotel&amp;rsquo;s ventilation system. Initially, it wasn’t serious and could have been contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are always confident. The leaders in Shanghai are the same. They will choose us for our gridded risk control, precise prevention and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are now visible to everyone; the new cases have accumulated beyond 20,000. Driven to desperation, they chose a lockdown, but avoided using the term &amp;ldquo;lockdown&amp;rdquo; externally, as they had previously stated in press conferences that Shanghai did not need a lockdown, preserving what little face they had left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buy-groceries&#34;&gt;Buy groceries
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food delivery industry is a new sector created by the internet. The core of it is that you need someone to deliver for you, right? But due to widespread lockdowns caused by the pandemic, businesses could operate, but there was no one to make deliveries – the entire chain lacked its final link. People outside might not understand why everyone in Shanghai, an international metropolis, suddenly rushed to buy groceries. But if you think about it, it makes sense. Most people are from out of town, working and living in rented apartments. They usually eat at company cafeterias or restaurants, rarely cooking at home. When the usual routes were blocked, those who could afford it started buying groceries. Because this lockdown announcement wasn&amp;rsquo;t given in advance, most people didn’t have a significant stockpile of food or vegetables. This led to the rush seen in the videos, and that kind of gathering directly caused another wave of infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;industry&#34;&gt;Industry
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone I know works in the IT industry. The pandemic affected me, and I experienced working from home. Back in 2019, I was stuck at home for almost a month, rescheduling train tickets countless times, unable to determine when I could return to Shenzhen. It&amp;rsquo;s unimaginable how people in the catering, tourism, or many service industries have been getting by these past few years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>When you want to make money</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/when-you-want-to-make-money/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 03:23:53 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/when-you-want-to-make-money/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ordinary people are social creatures, that&amp;rsquo;s right, you are a person and an upright-walking animal with strong social attributes; you have feelings of inferiority and vanity. Society is constantly changing and eroding your sense of calm. We don’t discuss those great individuals who willingly burn themselves for society or the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;me-now&#34;&gt;Me now
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at average wages, or even considering salaries back home, my current income is already far above average – what more could I possibly be unsatisfied with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you earn ten thousand, you&amp;rsquo;ll think about earning a million; when you earn a million, you&amp;rsquo;ll think about earning ten million. This is human nature, and people must confront their own inner selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s that red-eyed thing, is it a more relaxed way of making money: short videos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone understands that entering this industry isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. What you see here is a short video, but what you don’t see is the scriptwriting and filming behind it. But everyone has a dream of being a genius, believing they are suited for that industry, that they are naturally gifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;begin-to-contact&#34;&gt;Begin to contact
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve watched so many videos. If you analyze the shots a little bit with your own brain, it’s obvious they have professional editing techniques and a very strong cinematic feel. Basically, that means some of them are from film school backgrounds. Of course, there’s logic behind grassroots success stories, but that doesn’t apply to most people, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Douyin, there are also many videos teaching you how to make videos. It&amp;rsquo;s then that people realize things – if it were truly profitable, why wouldn’t they do it themselves instead of teaching others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anti-human-recommendation-algorithm&#34;&gt;Anti-human recommendation algorithm
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, when Douyin&amp;rsquo;s algorithm recommended movie clips and anime clips, I would keep watching them and find them quite interesting. But then, when I started looking into how to make money on Douyin, it began recommending all sorts of tutorial videos non-stop, filling my entire recommendation feed. And I’m in the IT industry myself. At this point, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if those guys who designed the algorithm had a problem with their heads – are you suggesting that I&amp;rsquo;m stupid or that they&amp;rsquo;re stupid? The key thing is, it keeps finding new ways to recommend videos on how to make money using Douyin, trying different angles and types. This article is being written by me at 3 AM, and I didn’t even want to write it. I just wonder how long this business model can last, and for how long can it consume everyone&amp;rsquo;s time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understand-life&#34;&gt;Understand life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s laughable when you lecture others on how to do things, but can’t control yourself when it comes to your own actions. Not a pure technical blog writer, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t published some things domestically. Here, I just casually rant. If this gets shut down someday, I guess I’ll find another place. I can’t say Douyin hasn’t done anything; at least now, in terms of real-time news dissemination and promotion of national policies, they are actively cooperating. After all, in China, you can&amp;rsquo;t go against the Party, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back to when I was studying, it strikes me. When you truly can&amp;rsquo;t find the meaning of life, quietly reading a book is enough. In this era, how many people can still sit down and read quietly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also want to thank the advancements in science and technology here. If you can see this line, you’ll notice that the entire draft is very conversational. And honestly, I just kept reading it until it was finished. I used to use Sogou Input Method, for about seven or eight years. But when it comes to voice input, I have to say that iFlytek is still the professional choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article number for 2022 changed to 002. Why are there two extra zeros? Having a dream that the number of articles this year can exceed one hundred – that’s a dream for me. It can&amp;rsquo;t really be called articles, just some records. I examine myself three times a day; you’ll surely think of something, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Add a code copy button for something that seems simple</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/add-code-copy-button/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 01:23:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/add-code-copy-button/</guid>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent four hours on it, and when I saw that sentence, I thought it was funny – how could it take so long? Then I looked at the time: three hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s considered the first draft of 2022. Nothing complicated to do, just exactly as the title says (I was still quite young then). I thought simply copying &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ouuan.github.io/post/from-hexo-to-hugo/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;the assignment&lt;/a&gt; would be enough, saved it in my bookmarks, and waited for over a month before finally remembering this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always felt that Hugo had too few plugins when I migrated to it, and the inability to copy code made migrating notes from Evernote to my blog a cumbersome process. Copying code for those notes became tedious, seriously hindering my motivation to update my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prologue&#34;&gt;Prologue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a close look at the original author&amp;rsquo;s draft, read it through and then check out their introduction. Wow, I’ve stumbled upon an expert – a full-time undergraduate student at Tsinghua who started working with computers very early on. Man, they&amp;rsquo;re really something. Let me check out this blog first; I completely forgot what I was supposed to do. Oh, and let&amp;rsquo;s also take a look at the author&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;Github&lt;/code&gt; repository. This modified &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; theme is much better than the current one – it has so many new features. Let’s get it done. First, merge the relevant code over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/add-code-copy-button/2022-02-25-02-08-19.png&#34;
	width=&#34;215&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;129&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;311px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-feature-view-article-history-and-related-submission-records&#34;&gt;New feature: View article history and related submission records
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect is still pretty good; you can experience it by scrolling to the end of the article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really look at the author’s repository history before starting, thinking a simple merge would be fine. In the end, I merged a bunch of code, with conflicts and numerous iterations. I blindly overwrote things, mostly frontend and rendering templates, prioritizing what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repository address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TianlongXiang/hugo-theme-even&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/TianlongXiang/hugo-theme-even&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pitfall with Chinese documentation is that if you don&amp;rsquo;t adjust this parameter, &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; won&amp;rsquo;t be able to retrieve the current article&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;commit hash&lt;/code&gt;, leading to failed generation of historical links. You also need to modify the automated integration script when generating a complete history of articles; remember to pull all historical records from the current repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempting to pull the complete GitHub repository for dynamically updating the record of last modification time for articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Path exists in Chinese, Hugo GitInfo needs this setting enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;name: Build Github
run: git config --global core.quotePath false &amp;amp;&amp;amp; hugo -b &amp;quot;https://www.xiangtianlong.com/&amp;quot; -d &amp;quot;github_public&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ls
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;style-adjustments&#34;&gt;Style adjustments
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust the site content width. The previous design was suitable for both mobile and desktop, but in reality, no one views it on their phone; I even view it on my computer myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The directory bar supports auto-sizing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent over half an hour looking at &lt;code&gt;ouuan&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s code, but I still don’t really understand how to add the copy button&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time passes, and after a month, I thought of this again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand this assignment, let’s just copy another one; I should be able to figure it out eventually. The search results were surprisingly good – there was even a post in the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; official forum mentioning how to add a copy button. After checking it out, the logic is clear. Then something unexpected happened: when I looked at the site, the code block style rendered by &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; differed from the description in the documentation. This part is a bit complicated, so here’s a brief record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I barely understood front-end development, whenever I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand something, I would open the browser&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Inspect Element,&amp;rdquo; analyze the code, and rely on the style information on the right. Slowly, I began to understand the logic. I didn’t understand JavaScript, so I added some logs in the console. There were many things I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand, but I calmed down, slowly sorted out and broke down the logic, and eventually found a way forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are multiple &lt;code&gt;pre&lt;/code&gt; nodes, referring here to a single code block. The theme renders line numbers, resulting in two copy buttons appearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want code highlighting in the theme, but I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with how to set it up in this theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I looked at the documentation on the Hugo website, and I understand that there&amp;rsquo;s a markup setting to control code highlighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjusting the configuration file, it&amp;rsquo;s always been wrong, and the rendering doesn&amp;rsquo;t match expectations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found these settings for &lt;code&gt;pygmentsOptions&lt;/code&gt;, continued researching, adjusted the settings, and first removed the line numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure custom CSS stylesheets and configure custom JS scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten things to this point, it suddenly occurred to me that I saw a color scheme recently that was pretty good. Let’s change the button style: going with a Chinese-style celadon blue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;special-img-class&#34; style=&#34;width:20%&#34; src=&#34;2022-02-25-02-01-22.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;special-img-class&#34; style=&#34;width:20%&#34; src=&#34;2022-02-25-02-01-33.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent four hours on it, and when I saw that sentence, I thought it was funny – how could it take so long? Then I looked at the time: three hours&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is it that we spend our whole lives pursuing?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/we-exhaust-ourselves-chasing/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 21:09:58 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/we-exhaust-ourselves-chasing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Wang Xizhi said: A woman&amp;rsquo;s companionship, over a lifetime of looking up and down, may be found in the depths of one’s heart through understanding her words; or it may be entrusted to someone and exist beyond the confines of the body&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person&amp;rsquo;s life is like a flash of lightning, fleeting and ephemeral. Like grass and trees flourishing in spring and withering in autumn, like the rising and setting of the sun and moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, in this life, I have so many desires&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lying by the stream as a child, peeling lotus pods, busily releasing kites in the east wind, chasing after yellow butterflies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also leaned against mulberry trees to learn how to grow melons; returning with a full meal after dusk, he would still lie beneath the bright moon without taking off his raincoat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I hope to achieve distinction in the imperial examinations, have a beautiful companion by my side, enjoy endless wealth, rise through the ranks steadily, be surrounded by esteemed guests, and celebrate every night with music and revelry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing old, yet desiring health and longevity – welcome servants, await children, a game of chess, a close friend, a pot of wine, a courtyard, and enjoying family life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see how people rush about, all for a few pieces of silver. Yet those few pieces of silver can resolve countless sorrows in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of people are still struggling to make a living, where do they have time to pursue meaning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, a person&amp;rsquo;s life is just an experience, like grass, trees, and the sun and moon, experiencing the cycle of desires&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not understanding life leads to the feeling that one is like a mayfly adrift in the universe, a grain of sand in the vast ocean. Sorrow for the brevity of my existence, envy of the endlessness of the Yangtze River. Understanding life brings joy in what you encounter, satisfaction with what you gain, contentment and self-sufficiency, unaware of approaching old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pursue wealth and fame, you can pursue poetry, wine, flowers, and tea; you can pursue the clear breeze on the river, or the bright moon in the mountains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;rsquo;t be overly concerned with the outcome, as outcomes are fleeting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To exhaust a lifetime, arriving in this world, striving to experience as much of life’s joys and sorrows, birth, aging, sickness, and death as possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this line from Big Fish &amp;amp; Begonia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lives are very short, and we will eventually lose them, so why not be a little bolder? Love someone, climb a mountain, chase a dream. There are many things in life that have no answers, so why not be a little bolder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like “The Pavilion of Prince Shaobo” and “Ode to the Red Cliffs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of the feeling that arises when recalling people of the past is as if it were a contract. I have never failed to feel grief and regret upon contemplating literature, unable to fully grasp it in my mind. Indeed, I know that life and death are vain conceits, and equating all lives is a foolish fabrication. Those who come after will view us as we now view those of the past. Alas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some stock codes contain &amp;ldquo;.&amp;rdquo; or other special characters, and when submitted to Interactive Brokers (IB) via the &amp;ldquo;Fix&amp;rdquo; report, certain conversions of the stock code names are required&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRK/B -&amp;gt; BRK B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Interactive Brokers, it can be analyzed to determine that the conversion rules are fixed and can be implemented through coding. When the rules are not fixed, the system generally needs to store corresponding mapping relationships, which business operation personnel update periodically.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lost</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/lost-and-confused/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 18:01:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/lost-and-confused/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Often, at a certain stage in life, people fall into a state of confusion, unsure of what they truly want. In the mundane routine of work, they gradually lose sight of the pursuit of meaning in their profession. Remembering when I first graduated, my heart was filled with fervent aspirations. Back then, I would have said without hesitation that I longed to write code—code that could amaze and be incredibly impressive. However, since starting work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed more to business-related matters, much of which is thanks to the benefits brought about by industry development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding my outlook on life, I haven&amp;rsquo;t included marriage, having children, and establishing a family or career within my sphere of thought. My mind is almost empty, and I just want to enjoy the present moment. Every weekend, I like to play games quietly and often spend the whole day staying at home, immersed in my own little world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs something in their life that they love and wholeheartedly dedicate themselves to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buy-a-house&#34;&gt;Buy a house
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I was still thinking about saving up to buy my own house and carefully calculating every expense towards that goal. However, seeing the prices of houses continue to rise, I went from initial anxiety and resentment to eventually becoming numb. I gradually felt that even if I bought a house, it would just be another heavy burden on me, so I gave up on the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;save-money&#34;&gt;Save money
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, saving money was to achieve small goals, such as building a high-performance desktop computer, buying a long-desired camera, or taking an impromptu trip. But now, I approach saving money with a more relaxed attitude, no longer worrying too much about daily expenses, eating what I want when I see it, and daring to try new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;go-home&#34;&gt;Go home
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I realized that what I longed for most in my heart was simply to go home. It didn&amp;rsquo;t require doing anything special, just returning to that familiar place and feeling the warmth and tranquility of home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Hong Kong stock futures basic concepts</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-futures-basics/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 10:54:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-futures-basics/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As financial markets continue to evolve, investors have begun seeking more effective investment tools to increase their returns. To meet investor demand, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has launched a series of stock futures contracts, the underlying stocks for which are listed on its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hong Kong Joint Stock Exchange Limited (Joint Stock Exchange). These contracts feature high liquidity and active trading volume. Investing in stock futures allows investors to participate in the performance of individual listed companies while also enjoying benefits such as short selling and leverage offered by the derivatives market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since stock futures represent leading companies within their respective industries, investors who believe that the performance of a particular industry will outperform or underperform the overall stock market can choose to invest in the stock futures of that industry accordingly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-definition&#34;&gt;Basic Definition
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stock futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a financial instrument equivalent to a specified quantity (contract size) of a specific stock at a predetermined price (the initial margin price) on a future, fixed date&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All stock futures contracts are cash-settled, and there is no physical delivery of shares when the contract expires&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contract-expires&#34;&gt;Contract expires
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The profit or loss amount, calculated as the difference between the initial agreement price and the final settlement price multiplied by the contract multiplier, will be debited from the account of the contract holder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final settlement price is the official closing price reported on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on the last trading day for the relevant stock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If investors in stock futures wish to close their positions before the contract expires, those who initially sold short only need to buy back a futures contract, while those who bought contracts need to sell one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;security-deposit&#34;&gt;Security deposit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When trading futures, both buyers and sellers must first pay a margin as security for fulfilling the contract. The clearing house will calculate profits and losses on all open contracts at the market price after each day&amp;rsquo;s closing, which serves as the basis for debiting or crediting investor accounts. If unfavorable market conditions result in an investor incurring losses and their margin falls below the stipulated level, the exchange will require the investor to top up their account within a specified timeframe to maintain the original margin level (i.e., cover the shortfall).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advantages&#34;&gt;Advantages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transaction fees are low: Each stock futures contract is equivalent to the value of thousands of shares of stock, and the commission for buying or selling contracts depends on the number of contracts, so transaction costs are very low relative to the contract value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short selling stocks is now easier: Investors can profit in a declining market by short selling stock futures, as they can do so conveniently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market makers are required by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to simultaneously provide bid and ask prices within a specified spread to ensure market liquidity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage allows investors to buy or sell stock futures contracts by paying only a small portion of the contract&amp;rsquo;s face value, making hedging and trading more cost-effective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing Foreign Exchange Risk for Overseas Investors: Stock futures contracts provide a way for overseas investors to invest in high-quality local stocks, as buying and selling stock futures requires only margin deposits rather than the full contract value, significantly reducing the foreign exchange risk faced by overseas investors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading is conducted through an electronic trading system: stock futures contracts are bought and sold using the exchange&amp;rsquo;s electronic trading system. All orders are executed on a price and time priority basis, and buy prices, sell prices, and transaction prices are displayed in real-time, achieving the highest level of market transparency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The clearing house provides performance guarantees: stock futures contracts will be registered, cleared, and have performance guarantees provided by Hong Kong Futures Clearing Company Limited (the Clearing House), which is wholly owned by the exchange. Since the Clearing House acts as the counterparty for all open positions, participants in the exchange will not need to bear counterparty risk. However, the scope of the guarantee does not include the financial obligations of exchange participants to their clients; investors must exercise caution when selecting a broker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dealer-system&#34;&gt;Dealer system
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market participants may register as market makers for individual stock futures, providing both bid and ask prices within a specified maximum spread. Exchange participants and their clients should note that individual stock futures may not have market maker registrations offering bid-ask spreads, and trading will be based on market order units. &lt;strong&gt;Investors should be aware that trading in stock futures without market maker registration may involve liquidity risk and should carefully consider before entering the market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-risks-of-trading-stocks-and-futures&#34;&gt;The risks of trading stocks and futures
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock futures involve high risk, and losses from buying or selling stock futures may exceed the margin deposited at opening a position, potentially requiring you to pay additional deposits in a short period. If these payments are not made, your positions may be closed out, and any resulting losses will be borne by you alone. Therefore, you must clearly understand the risks of trading stock futures and assess whether they are suitable for you. Before conducting transactions, you should consult with a broker or financial advisor based on your own financial situation and investment goals to determine if buying and selling futures and options contracts is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adjust-comments&#34;&gt;Adjust comments
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a company changes its equity structure through share offerings or bonus shares, it may lead to changes in the stock price at net asset value or on the effective date, and this may affect open positions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all other factors remain the same, the value of a shareholder&amp;rsquo;s portfolio will not change on the net asset value date, but this is different for buyers or holders of stock futures unless appropriate adjustments are made to the futures contract. Without adjusting the par value and if the multiplier of the stock futures contract remains unchanged, an adjustment in the stock price will have unreasonable and unfair effects on the value of the stock futures position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clearing house decides to adjust the ratio based on the principle of maintaining the fair value of futures contracts, and will only make adjustments when there are significant changes. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing will announce the details of the adjustment, and exchange participants must inform their clients about the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Decline of Capital Monopoly and the Online Education Industry</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:59:08 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The stock market has fallen sharply over the past two trading days, and new investors have experienced the risks of the market. Our country is about to enter an aging stage, and the birth rate data is bleak – the decline far exceeded estimates from relevant experts. Industries hindering the birth rate will be cracked down on by our party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-student-workload&#34;&gt;Reducing student workload
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We, born in the 90s, didn&amp;rsquo;t have so many extracurricular classes or tutoring sessions. After school, we would just run wild and play – partly because our families couldn’t afford it, and partly because tutoring services hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet established a brand reputation to convince parents. Twenty years have passed. Starting in 2019, the capitalization of K12 education began, with companies like Yuanfudao emerging as leading online tutoring platforms. With capital backing, they concentrated resources to create various prestigious tutoring programs, and even exorbitant fees couldn&amp;rsquo;t deter parental enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of urbanization, many parents have broken free from poverty and achieved upward mobility through education. Their work as office workers leaves them with little time to care for their children; they are under immense pressure themselves and don&amp;rsquo;t want their children to fall behind their peers. It’s difficult for someone from a humble background to rise above it without an appropriate education. In China, ordinary families find it hard to maintain or further advance their social class without one. If a child enters vocational high school, the perceived decline in social status is something most parents cannot accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look back at why extracurricular tutoring exists, and why parents need it. The knowledge and example questions in textbooks are easy to understand, but many subjects cover a broad range of topics, though they are mostly superficial concepts without much depth. Talent selection mechanisms require a certain degree of differentiation, which leads to a contradiction: test questions based solely on textbook knowledge cannot achieve the screening effect and need to be expanded horizontally and vertically. These areas are impossible for teachers to cover in class, and this space has fostered the growth of extracurricular tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document contains a large amount of content, with thirty detailed provisions regulating various aspects. Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the guiding document outline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce overall homework volume and duration comprehensively, alleviating students&amp;rsquo; excessive workload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the quality of schools’ after-school services to meet students&amp;rsquo; diverse needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strictly regulate and govern off-campus tutoring activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significantly improve the quality of education and teaching, ensuring that students learn well and master their studies while at school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen supporting measures and enhance capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully organized and implemented, striving for practical results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;elite-education&#34;&gt;Elite education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the education industry, there&amp;rsquo;s another phenomenon: an increasing number of private schools are emerging, and public schools are struggling to provide sufficient high-quality resources (leading to the rise of academic district housing). Various large-scale education groups attract quality teachers with high salaries, establish excellent teaching environments, and gradually build their own brands. The most famous example is the &lt;strong&gt;Yancheng Model&lt;/strong&gt;. In my hometown, the average company salary is around 3,000 yuan, while a good private elementary school can cost between 9,000 to 10,000 yuan for an entire year of tuition. Education groups create a virtuous cycle: I charge high tuition fees, but the teachers are excellent, and the students achieve good grades. This allows me to raise tuition fees, and parents will still send their children here. Public school resources (teachers) will gradually be attracted to private schools, eventually becoming synonymous with inferior education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;algorithm-squeezing&#34;&gt;Algorithm squeezing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data indicates that Meituan has nearly four million signed-up riders, with 400,000 to 500,000 active riders. Many rely on this work to support their families. Endless algorithmic pressure squeezes delivery time, reducing people to quantifiable units and feeding them into calculations. It constantly explores the breaking point of delivery personnel. They think they&amp;rsquo;re clever, &lt;strong&gt;disregarding human nature to serve capital&lt;/strong&gt;. The market is here; let’s play it well, sustainably, rather than &lt;strong&gt;monopolizing and granting special privileges – a capitalist game where reckless growth will inevitably end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility&#34;&gt;Stock market volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 2021, education stocks represented by New Oriental performed a fancy dive, and the good future followed in American trading before the market opened, &lt;strong&gt;halving its stock price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our country has gradually entered an aging population phase, and various social phenomena affecting family planning must be addressed; internet companies with monopolistic practices and excessive overtime have been fined, and the education industry where capital is concentrated has also been regulated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no allowing for the capitalization of the education industry; one vote directly rejects companies in that sector from going public and seeking financing, resulting in widespread lamentations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Oriental&amp;rsquo;s Severed Waist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waist-cutting New Oriental&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinduoduo&amp;rsquo;s Plunge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meituan&amp;rsquo;s Plunge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reference-link&#34;&gt;Reference link
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators Intensify Scrutiny, Online Education Industry Suddenly &amp;ldquo;Brakes&amp;rdquo;
The General Office of the State Council issued the &amp;ldquo;Opinions on Further Reducing the Homework Burden and Off-Campus Tutoring Burden for Students in Compulsory Education Stage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A method for disrupting systems, used for system stability testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The domestic internet industry always likes to come up with something new, sometimes you hear a term and most people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know what it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading some articles, I still find this definition of chaos engineering in its early stages relatively easy to accept&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early explorations of Chaos Engineering have actually existed within the industry all along, previously appearing as fault testing and disaster recovery drills. However, with the continuous development of microservice architectures and the increasing complexity of distributed systems, Chaos Engineering has begun to emerge and gain increasing attention. After Netflix formally proposed the concept of Chaos Engineering, related theories began to rapidly enrich. Netflix&amp;rsquo;s practices have also proven the immense significance of Chaos Engineering in the field of stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Suspend pod in Kubernetes</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/kubernetes-pause-pod/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Deployment controller implements a very important function in Kubernetes clusters: the horizontal scaling and shrinking of Pods. This capability is essential for platforms in the traditional cloud era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encountered a business scenario where data in the database needs to be modified and Pod nodes need to be restarted after adjustment. However, while the Pod is running, table fields are constantly being modified. It&amp;rsquo;s necessary to temporarily pause the application’s updates to the table, adjust the data, and then restore the Pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there other ways to achieve a similar effect as pausing, besides forcefully deleting Deployments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;kubectl scale --replicas=0 deployment/&amp;lt;your-deployment&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before seeing the answer, many people probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have thought of it. After seeing the answer, they might smile and realize their thinking hasn’t moved on – still stuck in an era focused on directly manipulating processes, wanting to operate business processes directly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fund and fixed income wealth management</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/fund-and-fixed-income-wealth-management/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 11:27:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/fund-and-fixed-income-wealth-management/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We, those of us born in the 90s, didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel much about the financial crisis of 2008, because we were young and not yet at the age of investing. The bull market in 2015 was grand and spectacular, and its decline was equally dramatic, ultimately requiring intervention from the government to save the market. At the same time, it brought the concept of funds into the view of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ant-financial-and-alipay&#34;&gt;Ant Financial and Alipay
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alipay, as a natural traffic entry point under Ant Group, was positioned as a payment tool from its inception. When it comes to buying funds, most people chose Alipay over WeChat. Alipay successfully transformed fund sales into ordinary shopping. The bull market that started in 2019 and the mutual warming among fund managers were ultimately driven by the monetary easing guided by the pandemic. Those who entered (the market) made money, and those who watched from the sidelines became envious and rushed to enter. The speed at which new funds are breaking through the billion-dollar mark is accelerating. With &amp;ldquo;aunties&amp;rdquo; now starting to buy funds, trillion-dollar funds are not far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the booming popularity of Ant Financial&amp;rsquo;s internet-based fund sales platform, ordinary people typically encountered fund sales only when depositing money at banks, where branch managers would enthusiastically introduce various financial products. The packaging and promotional information on the internet, along with the exorbitant advertising fees paid by fund sales institutions, have made Alipay’s fund advertisements completely detached from reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal bank fixed-term wealth management yields 4%, P2P wealth management, which was popular a few years ago, yielded 8%, and credit card interest rates are 12%. Our protagonist, the fund promoted by Alipay, yields 150% and 250% when the market goes up, making everyone happy. But what about when the market goes down? Alipay is playing with fire. The growth data provided only shows the returns for the past three years on the surface, and established funds only show annualized average returns. Why don&amp;rsquo;t they dare to write out the average annual return each year? Is it because it’s difficult to calculate? The answer is no; it’s because the data isn’t good-looking and doesn’t easily guide customers to buy funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fixed-income-wealth-management&#34;&gt;Fixed income wealth management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;China hasn&amp;rsquo;t entered the era of negative interest rates yet; bank deposits and government bonds are the most secure fixed-income products. Pure bond funds are also good options. You can easily find China’s average salary by checking data released by local statistical bureaus. The author describes a simple scenario: an asset size of 2 million yuan, with an annualized return of 4%, resulting in annual earnings that exceed the average salary in most cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s mostly based on my personal experiences, there’s a lot I could write about. If you want to learn more, I recommend reading books on economics; don’t blindly follow anyone. For ordinary families, the core of financial management is preservation of value, not chasing dreams of getting rich quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle often says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing the right thing at the right time yields the greatest value; studying diligently and obtaining a good education is better than earning pocket money by distributing flyers; working hard when you first graduate can bring substantial returns in salary increases; when starting a family, learn to take care of your home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those interested can take a look at this speech: Regarding time, you need to read many books to find the answer. The text transcript is available on this site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A trade disruption refers to when a trade has been executed and IB has received execution information from the exchange. Then, the exchange realizes that an error has occurred (such as pricing, electronic processing issues, obvious errors, etc.) and decides to disrupt (cancel) the trade. This process is entirely determined and controlled by the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A busted traderefers to a situation where an execution occurs and IB receives the execution messagefrom the exchange. The exchange then realizes some type of error (Pricing,electronic, obvious error, etc) and rules to bust (cancel) the trade. Theexchange makes these rulings entirely on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a trading perspective, it is equivalent to trade cancellation and trade correction on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/docker-two-three-things/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 09:26:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/docker-two-three-things/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having worked for many years, I&amp;rsquo;ve primarily encountered the &lt;code&gt;CentOS&lt;/code&gt; operating system. If you are a &lt;code&gt;Mac&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/code&gt; user, some of this content may not be applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installation section can refer to the manual from Tsinghua University: [https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/docker-ce/]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to an unknown and mysterious force, it is recommended to use the repository addresses provided by cloud vendors for Docker installations within China. Here, &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba Cloud&lt;/strong&gt; is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;set-warehouse-source-address&#34;&gt;Set warehouse source address
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;yum install yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo http://mirrors.aliyun.com/docker-ce/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deploy-the-latest-version&#34;&gt;Deploy the latest version
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a commonly used background service, Docker is recommended to be set as a startup item; the current command applies to CentOS 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo yum install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io &amp;amp;&amp;amp; systemctl enable --now docker
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deploy-specified-version&#34;&gt;Deploy specified version
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of &lt;code&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; are not fully synchronized. If you need to deploy &lt;code&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; next, please refer to the &lt;code&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; deployment instructions and install the specified version of &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;yum list docker-ce --showduplicates | sort -r
sudo yum install -y docker-ce-18.09.2-3.el7 docker-ce-cli-18.09.2-3.el7 containerd.io-18.09.2-3.el7 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; systemctl enable --now docker
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adding-docker-permissions-for-regular-users&#34;&gt;Adding Docker permissions for regular users
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;uninstall&#34;&gt;Uninstall
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo yum erase -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;everyday-use&#34;&gt;Everyday use
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;mirror-acceleration&#34;&gt;Mirror acceleration
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still unknown mysterious forces causing slow image pulls. At this time, domestic cloud vendors have stepped up and provided many acceleration services. I still recommend &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain the accelerated address, please register for an Alibaba Cloud account yourself. This service is free, and Alibaba Cloud also provides a free image building service.&lt;/p&gt;

They shared information on JMeter installation and command usage, InfluxDB features and Docker installation methods, as well as simple deployment and configuration of Grafana. The document summarizes experiences and references for high-performance programming patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you all know, I have a strong interest in hardware. By chance, the testing team was using JMeter for performance testing and found that the performance wasn&amp;rsquo;t improving. As a curious person, I decided to jump in and see how our company does pressure testing. There’s also a little story here: at some point in the distant past, I saw a post on Open Source China about how to create high-end performance test charts. The testers have already seen the Windows version execute tests and achieve visualized TPS data display. What use would there be for configuring another web panel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you think is right, you won&amp;rsquo;t understand until you try it yourself
Don&amp;rsquo;t use GUI mode for load testing! only for Test creation and Test debuggin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official recommendation is to obtain the load test report through the command line and display it with a GUI, which may introduce data errors? I don&amp;rsquo;t have a very deep understanding of JMeter, but at least it gives me a reason to tinker with the &lt;code&gt;Linux&lt;/code&gt; console panel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posts on Open Source China indicate that the deployment method for the core components is not user-friendly, and you need to follow a public account to download the required files. As a young generation, of course, I replaced it with &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt;. To put it simply, the servers are still located within mainland China, so accessing cross-border sources is very slow. At least for image services, Alibaba Cloud has a free accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the installation and deployment of &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;, details will not be repeated here; please refer to previous articles for more information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following content is divided into two main parts: building the basic test environment components and a simple explanation of each component&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jmeter&#34;&gt;Jmeter
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apache JMeter is a load testing tool developed by the Apache organization based on Java. It is used for stress testing software and was originally designed for web application testing, but has since been extended to other testing areas. It can be used to test static and dynamic resources such as static files, small Java services, CGI scripts, Java objects, databases, FTP servers, etc. JMeter can simulate a huge load on servers, networks or objects to test their strength under different stress categories and analyze overall performance. In addition, JMeter can perform functional/regression testing of applications by creating scripts with assertions to verify that your program returns the expected results. For maximum flexibility, JMeter allows the use of regular expressions to create assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache JMeter can be used to test the performance of static and dynamic resources (files, Servlets, Perl scripts, Java objects, databases and queries, FTP servers, etc.). It can be used to simulate heavy loads on servers, networks or objects to test their strength or analyze overall performance under different types of stress. You can use it for graphical analysis of performance or for load testing your servers/scripts/objects with high concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-deployment-on-centos-7&#34;&gt;JMeter deployment on CentOS 7
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;code&gt;JDK&lt;/code&gt; runtime environment, download the &lt;code&gt;JMeter&lt;/code&gt; installation package&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
wget https://mirrors.bfsu.edu.cn/apache//jmeter/binaries/apache-jmeter-5.4.tgz &amp;amp;&amp;amp; tar -xf apache-jmeter-5.4.tgz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configure environment variables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;export JMETER_HOME=$HOME/jmeter/apache-jmeter-5.4
export PATH=$JMETER_HOME/bin:$PATH
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-commands&#34;&gt;JMeter commands
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it will connect to the &lt;code&gt;Grafana&lt;/code&gt; control panel. You can omit the &lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt; parameter and observe the data in the &lt;code&gt;web&lt;/code&gt; console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;jmeter -n -t /tmp/order-500-10s.jmx -l /tmp/jmeter-order-report-20200109/order-500-10s.jtl
# 一般不用测试结果和测试报告，简化命令
jmeter -n -t /tmp/order-500-10s.jmx
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;influxdb&#34;&gt;InfluxDB
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfluxDB is an open-source distributed time series, event and metrics database written in Go, requiring no external dependencies. This database is now primarily used to store large volumes of timestamped data, such as DevOps monitoring data, APP metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influxdb-features&#34;&gt;InfluxDB Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The characteristics of InfluxDB can be summarized into 9 aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unstructured (patternless): can be any number of columns;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The retention period for metrics can be configured&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports time-related functions (such as min, max, sum, count, mean, median, etc.) for statistical analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for storage policies: can be used for data deletion and modification. (InfluxDB does not provide methods for deleting or modifying data.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting continuous queries: a set of statements that are automatically started on a schedule in the database, and when paired with storage policies, can reduce InfluxDB&amp;rsquo;s system footprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Native HTTP support, built-in HTTP API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports SQL-like syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports setting the number of data replicas in the cluster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support periodic sampling data and write it to another measurement for granular storage of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influxdb-docker-installation&#34;&gt;InfluxDB Docker installation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;mkdir influxdb &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd influxdb &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
docker run -p 8086:8086 -d --name influxdb -v $PWD:/var/lib/influxdb influxdb:1.7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the container, execute a command, and manually create a database&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;root@bce0a55bbc72:/# influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.7.10
InfluxDB shell version: 1.7.10
&amp;gt; 交互面板执行命令
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;creating-databases-and-users-in-influxdb&#34;&gt;Creating Databases and Users in InfluxDB
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create database: create database jmeter_t2
View databases
Switch database: use jmeter_t2
Create user &amp;ldquo;admin&amp;rdquo; with password &amp;lsquo;admin&amp;rsquo; with all privileges
View users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; show users
user  admin
----  -----
admin true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the user permission &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; is displayed as &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, the database preparation is complete&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grafana&#34;&gt;Grafana
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing test cases, I realized that the chart display isn&amp;rsquo;t really necessary. The &lt;code&gt;tps&lt;/code&gt; data for the interface can already be observed when executed in the command line; mostly, I just want to know the internal execution time of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly deploy a Grafana dashboard, import configuration files, and connect to InfluxDB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The console supports filtering test results by tag, and generally only an &lt;code&gt;InfluxDB&lt;/code&gt; database needs to be configured&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application Name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Case Name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/linux-setup-jmeter-testing-environment/Snipaste_2021-03-09_19-44-22.png&#34;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;docker run -d --name=grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana:7.3.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;TPS&lt;/code&gt; and related values calculated in the web version can be inconsistent with the aggregated report in &lt;code&gt;JMeter&lt;/code&gt; due to the sampler interval, see reference link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.vinsguru.com/jmeter-real-time-results-influxdb-grafana/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.vinsguru.com/jmeter-real-time-results-influxdb-grafana/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document also describes how to customize listeners&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-performance programming inherently relies on a single loop thread; any locks, queuing for entry, and queuing for exit will cause unnecessary performance loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time spent on core business logic is greater than the time spent introducing other code; concurrency can effectively improve efficiency, and if the core processing time is sufficiently small, it&amp;rsquo;s best to be cautious when introducing other code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Red Hat and CentOS lifecycles</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/redhat-centos-lifecycle/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 20:02:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/redhat-centos-lifecycle/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Online production environments typically use Red Hat and CentOS as their operating systems. Links to the official websites documenting the lifecycles of these two systems are provided, along with shared experiences upgrading from CentOS 8 to CentOS 8 Stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In online production environments, Red Hat and CentOS are currently the mainstream choices in China. Following the retirement of Red Hat 6 in recent years, here are links to the official websites for the lifecycles of these two systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CentOS Product Specification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS are popular choices for enterprise-grade server operating systems. RHEL offers a stable support and update cycle, suitable for enterprise applications. CentOS, as the community version of RHEL, provides similar functionality and stability but lacks official support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chase-for-more&#34;&gt;Chase for more
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I published this article, I never thought I would update it two years later. Just the other day, I upgraded my daily-use virtual machine from CentOS 8 to CentOS 8 Stream. I won&amp;rsquo;t say much about how to choose for production environments, but I still prefer the latest versions for local environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentOS 8 Stream is a rolling release version that offers faster updates and new features compared to traditional CentOS, making it suitable for development and testing environments&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>US-China trade war</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-china-trade-war/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 19:52:41 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-china-trade-war/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a tangent, the differences between socialism with Chinese characteristics and capitalism. From the older generation, I’ve heard that to get rich, you must first build roads. Infrastructure construction in China is funded by the state; in a capitalist society, these would be contracted out. In remote areas, there are no profits to be made, so companies wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be willing to take on the work. Talking too much will stray from the current article’s theme. Ordinary people may feel that the trade war has little impact on their lives, but in reality, China’s high-end manufacturing has always been relatively weak. In the IT industry I work in, memory, hard drives, CPUs, and graphics cards – the core components of assembling a computer – all come from foreign factories. The cost of these parts accounts for 50% of the total price of the machine. High-end manufacturing is imperative. The collision between China and the United States is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reference-materials&#34;&gt;Reference materials
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Sino-American trade war that began in 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made in China 2025&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sino-American trade war, also known as the China–United States trade war, or more briefly as the Sino-US trade dispute, Sino-US trade friction, Sino-US trade quarrel, or US-China trade war, is a trade war between the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China and the United States of America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade dispute originated when U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on March 22, 2018, claiming that &amp;ldquo;China steals American intellectual property and business secrets,&amp;rdquo; and directed the United States Trade Representative to impose tariffs on goods imported from China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, involving an estimated total value of $60 billion. On July 6, 2018, the U.S. imposed a 25% additional tariff on Chinese exports worth $340 billion. The Ministry of Commerce of China responded with retaliatory measures on the same day, imposing a 25% additional tariff on U.S. exports to China worth $340 billion, including soybeans, one of the most exported products from the United States to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China had previously reached a consensus in May 2018 to suspend the trade war and issued a joint statement seeking resolution. However, the Office of the United States Trade Representative subsequently announced on June 16th a first batch of tariffs targeting $500 billion worth of Chinese goods entering the US, raising the original 10% tariff rate to 25%. In response, the State Council Tariff Commission of China retaliated with equivalent measures, and the Ministry of Commerce also resumed anti-dumping investigations on multiple US products. On July 6th, the Trump administration formally imposed a 25% tariff on $340 billion worth of Chinese goods in the first batch of tariffs, marking the formal implementation of Trump&amp;rsquo;s China tariff policy (the remaining $160 billion was subsequently subject to a 25% tariff on August 23rd). The Ministry of Commerce later stated in a statement that &amp;ldquo;The United States violated WTO rules and launched the largest trade war in economic history.&amp;rdquo; Customs authorities said that China’s countermeasures had been implemented immediately after the US tariffs took effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 1, at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump reached a consensus to conduct 90-day negotiations and suspend new trade measures during the negotiation period. After the deadline of March 1, 2019, the United States announced significant progress and extended the suspension of new trade measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs of 25% on Chinese goods entering the United States valued at approximately $200 billion, bringing the total subject to tariffs to $250 billion. The measure took effect on June 1 for Chinese products arriving at U.S. ports. On May 13, the State Council Tariff Commission of China announced that it would raise tariffs by 5% to 25% on certain imports from the United States valued at $60 billion, effective June 1. On June 1, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced a postponement of the U.S. tariff increase to June 15, while the State Council Tariff Commission of China stated that China’s retaliatory tariffs would take effect as scheduled on June 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 29, the leaders of the two countries, Xi Jinping and Donald Trump, held talks at the G20 Osaka Summit, agreeing to restart trade consultations and for the United States not to impose new tariffs on Chinese products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 1, due to the Trump administration&amp;rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the progress of China’s purchases of U.S. agricultural products, Trump announced on Twitter that starting September 1, 2019, a 10% tariff would be imposed on all remaining Chinese goods exported to the United States valued at $300 billion. On August 5, the exchange rate of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar fell below the 7 threshold. On the same day, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it was designating China as a currency manipulator. Subsequently, the Chinese government announced a suspension of purchases of U.S. agricultural products and on August 24 announced tariffs of 10% or 5% on approximately $750 billion worth of U.S. goods, and resumed tariffs on U.S. automobiles and their parts; in response, the United States increased the tariff rate previously imposed on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods to 15%, and raised the current 25% tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30%, but this was later put on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 16, 2020, China and the United States signed the Phase One trade agreement&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Building computers</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/computer-assembly-tips/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 14:33:46 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/computer-assembly-tips/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The author was fascinated by assembling computers from a young age and began learning about hardware assembly after starting university. They recommended websites for comparing hardware performance and provided purchasing suggestions, including CPU, solid-state drives, mechanical hard drives, and memory frequency. They also shared their experience and precautions regarding hardware selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;destiny-beyond-words&#34;&gt;Destiny, beyond words
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was little, I wanted to build my own computer, but the economic conditions just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t allow it. It wasn’t until college that I finally had the chance, and for portability reasons, I got a laptop. If you want a specific time frame, when did I start wanting to build a computer? It all started at the library back home. It was a pretty decent-sized library for a city district – it had an electronic reading room (though I never went, as it charged by the hour) and a magazine reading room. That’s where I stumbled upon magazines like “大众软件” (Popular Software) and “电脑报” (Computer News). For someone with limited exposure to computers, they were essentially divine educational resources. Seeing chapters about raiding dungeons made me want to build my own computer so I could pull mobs and be a main damage dealer; seeing the &amp;ldquo;black technology&amp;rdquo; sparked fantasies of recreating what was described in the books (a discussion on using hacking tools). Though high school coursework was demanding, with my limited knowledge at the time, I felt I needed to both study and play. It was a pretty carefree time. I’d often use going to the library as an excuse, grabbing a small bag and strolling over there. The city wasn&amp;rsquo;t that big, so I usually walked. Once inside, I’d enjoy the air conditioning while reading novels, comics, and gaming magazines, occasionally glancing at some serious books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you get older, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget things. This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time something like this has happened at the library. When I was in junior high school, my relatives assembled a computer, and I don’t remember why they built that machine back then. The operating system was Windows 2003, and the games included the card game and Age of Empires. I spent all sorts of time trying to sneak the keys and play games with my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering junior high, the school offered basic computer training. Later, when I transferred schools, I was also introduced to the concept of computer competitions. By the time I reached high school, I participated in NOIP once. Speaking of this, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible not to mention the power of alumni – the high school’s computer building was funded by alumni donations and included a computer lab and library. It was actually during the initial wave of China&amp;rsquo;s internet boom at that time. School leaders also supported participation in computer competitions; after all, several seniors from the previous two years had been admitted to key universities through computer-related programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never looked back at my relationship with computers like this before. No wonder I made such a complete shift from the automation major to the computer industry after graduation – the seeds were already sown, though those involved didn’t realize it. Having been exposed to them since childhood, I thought I was quite knowledgeable, but in reality, I only understood the basics. My biggest advantage was that initial passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hardware-assembly&#34;&gt;Hardware assembly
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browse Carrefour, Chiphell, and Zhihu&amp;rsquo;s computer building sections; a beginner can relatively easily create a list of the machine they need. When purchasing a CPU after 2019, if your financial situation isn’t abundant, AMD is the best choice for higher performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a translation of the provided Chinese text: I recommend a commonly used hardware performance comparison website: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/&lt;/a&gt;, which is comparable to Xianyu (闲鱼) for pricing. True experts can find great deals on used items on Xianyu, saving a lot of money. If you&amp;rsquo;re not very knowledgeable, I don’t recommend using it; I bought fake memory there myself. Although it seems to be working fine so far, I’m not entirely sure, and the model and parameters are completely mismatched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sn550-vs-sn750&#34;&gt;SN550 VS SN750
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between the SN550 1TB and the SN750 1TB is that their sustained read/write speeds differ by a factor of two – one reaches 850MB, the other 1.6GB. However, there&amp;rsquo;s no noticeable difference in daily use because both have the same 4K performance. Of course, this refers to the 1TB capacity SN550; the 500GB and 250GB versions have slower sequential read/write speeds. Honestly, unless you’re not worried about cost, the SN550 is fine for everyday use. The main reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy it isn&amp;rsquo;t its sequential read/write speed, but rather that it only comes in a maximum of 1TB capacity, while the SN750 offers 2TB. For me, the value lies more in having an extra M.2 NVMe slot on my motherboard than in the price difference between these SSDs, without needing to expand further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the consensus of online users, purchasing an adapter board will allow a B150 motherboard to support an M.2 SSD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;choosing-a-mechanical-hard-drive&#34;&gt;Choosing a Mechanical Hard Drive
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, mechanical hard drives are priced stably. For users with large storage needs, it is recommended to select a suitable mechanical hard drive. Frequent downloaders are advised to consider enterprise-grade hard drives, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Western Digital Gold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seagate Exos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s recommended to partition large-capacity mechanical hard drives. Frequent download operations should be directed to a specific partition. If bad sectors appear later, they can be concentrated in one partition, and that partition can then be discarded, effectively extending the lifespan of the mechanical hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;memory-frequency&#34;&gt;Memory frequency
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting from the perspective of daily work, frequency will not have a significant impact on performance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory Timing Memory (Salted Fish Memory)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory timings (or RAM timings) are four parameters describing the performance of synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM): CL, TRCD, TRP, and TRAS, measured in clock cycles. They are typically written as four numbers separated by hyphens, such as 7-8-8-24. The fourth parameter (RAS) is often omitted, and a fifth parameter may be added: Command rate, usually 2T or 1T, also written as 2N or 1N. These parameters specify latency times that affect random access memory speed. Lower numbers generally indicate faster performance. The ultimate element determining system performance is the actual latency time, typically measured in nanoseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When converting memory timings to actual delays, it&amp;rsquo;s most important to note that they are measured in clock cycles. Without knowing the duration of a clock cycle, it’s impossible to determine if one set of numbers is faster than another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the clock frequency of DDR3-2000 memory is 1000 MHz, and its clock cycle is 1 ns. Based on this 1 ns clock, a CL=7 results in an absolute latency of 7 ns. Faster DDR3-2666 (clocking at 1333 MHz with a 0.75 ns cycle) may use a larger CL=9, but still produce a shorter absolute latency of 6.75 ns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern DIMMs include a serial presence detect (SPD) ROM chip, which contains memory timings recommended for automatic configuration. The PC&amp;rsquo;s BIOS may allow users to adjust these timings to improve performance (with the risk of reducing stability), or in some cases increase stability (such as using the recommended timings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Memory bandwidth measures memory throughput and is typically limited by transfer rate rather than latency. It is possible to continuously transmit at peak rates by interleaving access to multiple internal banks of SDRAM. Bandwidth can be increased at the expense of increased latency. Specifically, each new generation of DDR memory has a higher transfer rate, but absolute latency does not change significantly, especially for the first batch of products in a new generation, which often have longer latencies than the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with increased memory latency, increasing memory bandwidth can improve the performance of computer systems with multiple processors or multiple execution threads. Higher bandwidth will also enhance the performance of integrated graphics cards without dedicated video memory.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Website acceleration and domain settings</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/website-acceleration-and-domain-setup/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 10:36:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/website-acceleration-and-domain-setup/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to slow access to GitHub Pages within China, the author applied for a personal domain name and purchased CDN acceleration services from a domestic cloud hosting provider. During the configuration process, the author encountered an issue where the www subdomain was inaccessible. The problem was eventually resolved by deleting the wildcard domain resolution and setting up the second-level domain separately. The author also shared the principles and configuration experience of CDN acceleration, as well as the attempts and lessons learned from using Nginx reverse proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, and due to some well-known reasons, accessing GitHub Pages from within China can be slow. Therefore, I applied for a personal domain name and purchased CDN acceleration services from a domestic cloud hosting provider. When setting up the acceleration service, I remembered that I had a development machine with Docker, frp, k8s, and other services deployed, all of which have corresponding dashboards. Following the principle of not wasting resources, I configured several reverse proxies and linked them to subdomains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was happily using my second-level domain, I suddenly found that the www subdomain was inaccessible. In Alibaba Cloud, DNS was configured to resolve simultaneously to both &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.xiangtianlong.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;www.xiangtianlong.com&lt;/a&gt; and xiangtianlong.com. When CDN acceleration had not been enabled yet, both domains worked normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When configuring CDN acceleration, due to having too many subdomains, a wildcard domain rule was enabled, routing everything to the development machine. This resulted in the www subdomain also going down. Yes, you read that right, www is a subdomain. The actual website is deployed on GitHub Pages, and the development machine has no cached web content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding why the site wasn&amp;rsquo;t deployed on the development machine, it’s because it’s a static blog and paired with GitHub Actions, which automatically integrates and publishes – it’s really great&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;domain-name&#34;&gt;Domain name
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-professional web development doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve SEO or cross-domain issues when it comes to understanding domain names. For a blog site, using a bare domain can highlight the blogger’s site—this refers to people like me who use Chinese pinyin as their domain name—and with most access now being mobile, it allows for fewer characters to be entered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desktop version allows you to skip typing www and com using keyboard shortcuts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cdn&#34;&gt;CDN
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used both Aliyun and Tencent Cloud, it’s not difficult for new users to get started. Tencent Cloud even has a video explaining the related concepts. The principle of CDN acceleration is the same as that of JD&amp;rsquo;s warehouse: when launching new products, they are pre-distributed to warehouses across the country, and when a delivery request is triggered, they are distributed from the nearest location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return address: The original address where website resources were stored&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache file settings, browser F12, management console, simple analysis of static and dynamic resources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All 0 days validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0-day validity for .php, .jsp, .asp, .aspx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.jpg, .png, .js, .css, .woff2 1-day validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tencent Cloud Configuration Rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache expiration rules can be configured up to 10 entries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The priority among multiple cache expiration rules is bottom-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cache expiration time can be set up to a maximum of 365 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-lamentable-confession&#34;&gt;A Lamentable Confession
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used Nginx before, and I thought I could understand the configuration of reverse proxy by simply searching online. But it was a bit confusing, and after fiddling with it for half a day, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even figure out a 302 redirect. It was useless. So I decided to try a simple approach: deleting the wildcard domain resolution mode and setting up each second-level domain independently. That’s when I suddenly noticed that Alibaba Cloud DNS had a feature called &amp;ldquo;Display URL Jump,&amp;rdquo; and after trying it, it turned out to be exactly what I wanted – a 302 redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the first secondary domain working fine, but when I tried to set up the second one, it didn&amp;rsquo;t work. I was almost starting to doubt myself. Then suddenly it started working after a while. It seems like Aliyun’s DNS propagation occasionally glitches out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reference-materials&#34;&gt;Reference materials
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are more and more website domains not adding the &amp;ldquo;www&amp;rdquo; prefix?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the difference between a domain with www and one without www?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker nginx Reverse Proxy Setup&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Blog IDE environment and random thoughts</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-ide-environment-and-ramblings/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 13:54:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-ide-environment-and-ramblings/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This article introduces the basic concepts of Markdown and its applications in various software. It recommends using VSCode as an IDE and lists recommended plugins. The author shares their experience switching from Hexo to Hugo, emphasizing Hugo&amp;rsquo;s flexibility and customization capabilities. Finally, it provides some tips for quickly getting started with new technologies and shares a trick for resolving the issue of Hugo theme styles not updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lightweight markup language that allows people to write documents in a readable and writable plain text format&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed Markdown syntax will not be elaborated on in this article; a recommended ebook is available, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://markdown-zh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many software on the market already support md as a writing format. The CSDN blog system launched an online editor that supports md syntax, and it comes with an introductory article about md syntax when you use it for the first time, which I think is pretty good; Evernote added support for md notes in 2018, with various md tag options in the quick bar, making it feel similar to editing regular articles, and the overall interactive process is friendly to beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ide-recommendations&#34;&gt;IDE recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing this article, it&amp;rsquo;s already 2020. You must have heard of VS Code, after all, anyone who considers using Git Page to build a blog system is an industry professional. In earlier years, Sublime and Atom were also good choices. With two years of community support, VS Code has developed rapidly and gradually become the preferred entry point for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Microsoft and the open-source community has transitioned from a state of separation to a honeymoon period: embracing open source. The company I work for has also actively introduced the Java ecosystem in recent years; in other words, the Java ecosystem is genuinely appealing for business development within China now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vs-code-extension-recommendations&#34;&gt;VS Code extension recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plugin List&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugins all have their own Readme files, introducing basic usage and core features; some plugin authors also provide dynamic effect demonstration images&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very convenient to introduce images using the image plugin method of Hugo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t memorized the shortcuts, so I opened the VS Code shortcut management menu and searched for &amp;ldquo;md,&amp;rdquo; looking at it several times; I reviewed the plugin usage instructions again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugo&#34;&gt;hugo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a writer, I&amp;rsquo;ve switched from &lt;code&gt;Hexo&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Hugo&lt;/code&gt;. My nature is to tinker and I simply couldn’t stand writing articles quietly without constantly experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo supports placing images and md documents in separate folders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Academic themes support various types of article styles in design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various convenient custom extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;academic&#34;&gt;academic
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website defaults to &lt;code&gt;exampleSite&lt;/code&gt;, menu integration uses the &lt;code&gt;#component&lt;/code&gt; method, and using &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; is recommended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The URL pattern allows for single-page jumps when clicking on navigation, rather than scrolling on the homepage—this is purely a matter of personal preference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Styles: Essays, Speeches, E-books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility: Customize overall style, customize CSS styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme&amp;rsquo;s support for Chinese is not yet very complete, mainly from a visual perspective – the font size isn&amp;rsquo;t quite in line with Chinese reading habits. However, Hexo’s developers are mostly Chinese, which gives it an advantage over Hugo in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;rsquo;s about doing things yourself and providing for your own needs. Inspect the browser elements. Once you’ve located the element, to know the CSS style name that needs modification, click &lt;strong&gt;Insert Style Rule Below&lt;/strong&gt; in the sidebar. Even with deeply nested CSS, you can easily get the node name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing &lt;strong&gt;custom.css&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introducing &lt;strong&gt;custom_js&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The theme&amp;rsquo;s built-in syntax highlighting settings, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/#highlighting-options.&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;official link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little one is about to complain again – why are you being so vague from beginning to end, not mentioning any details?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to say is, these things will be enough for you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Official manual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugin Description&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quickly get started with new technologies, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to first read the official documentation. Don’t worry about understanding everything on the first pass; at least get a general idea. Search engine results may not always be consistent with the latest version and could potentially mislead you. The same applies to reading new books – look at the table of contents first to understand what the author intends to cover. Sometimes, reading the preface is helpful; in some foreign works translated into Chinese, the translator&amp;rsquo;s preface often summarizes the book’s content and core ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-egg&#34;&gt;Easter egg
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching to the built-in Hugo Academic style didn&amp;rsquo;t change the appearance when published to the site. Clever users probably already figured it out: clear your local browser cache, and the problem is solved. The ingenious me: F12 developer mode, switch to &lt;code&gt;network&lt;/code&gt;, check &lt;code&gt;disable cache&lt;/code&gt;, refresh, done!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Automatic system switchover</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/auto-integration-system-switch/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Automatically deploy a Hugo blog to GitHub Pages and Gitee using GitHub Actions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;background-introduction&#34;&gt;Background introduction
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While updating my blog yesterday, I discovered that the Travis service was unavailable. Checking the Travis webpage, I saw that the progress was stuck on pulling the source code. Suddenly, I remembered the action service recently launched by GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that it will be quite busy and requires an application to use action, now that it has officially launched, and with free time this weekend, why not try out a new toy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find all official documents on the website, so I won&amp;rsquo;t reproduce them here. If you’ve used Kubernetes before, you’ll notice that the YAML configuration for actions is very similar to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For introductory tutorials or Chinese language resources, I recommend searching &lt;strong&gt;阮一峰&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/strong&gt;. There are two articles: the first is an introduction to basic grammar, and the second is a practical case study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Required knowledge points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;github secrets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;action grammar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core job is completed using existing components, pushed to domestic Gitee using commands. The command part is quite rough, all force pushes, and inherits the logic used with Travis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34;&gt;name: github pages and gitee pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - hugo

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          submodules: true

      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: &#39;latest&#39;
          extended: true

      - name: Build Github and Gitee ## 单个step只能写一个run命令
        run: hugo -b &amp;quot;https://www.xiangtianlong.com/&amp;quot; -d &amp;quot;github_public&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; hugo -b &amp;quot;https://www.xiangtianlong.com/&amp;quot; -d &amp;quot;gitee_public&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ls

      - name: Deploy Github
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.BLOG_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./github_public
          publish_branch: master
          cname: xiangtianlong.com

      - name: Deploy Gitee
        run: cd ./gitee_public &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git init &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git config user.name &amp;quot;TianlongXiang&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git config user.email &amp;quot;tianlongxiang51@gmail.com&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git add . &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git commit -m &amp;quot;Update TianlongXiang&#39;s Blog&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git push --force &amp;quot;https://xiangtianlong:${{ secrets.GITEE_PASSWORD }}@gitee.com/xiangtianlong/xiangtianlong.git&amp;quot; master:master   
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the actions provided by the official market, there are quite a few supported features currently available, and after building a Docker image, you no longer need to rely on services provided by Docker Hub&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked Hugo&amp;rsquo;s issues and found that when using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy Git Pages, the final published webpage needs to be on the master branch. If deployed to other branches, GitHub will display a message indicating that there are syntax problems with the deployment webpage in the settings interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, it&amp;rsquo;s because Hugo&amp;rsquo;s source files are located in the master branch, and GitHub is treating them as the source code for the Jelly blog, leading to errors that prevent checking and passing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is also simple: put the Hugo source files on another branch and publish the static files on the master branch&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>China&#39;s good future will be a China with good elders</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/future-good-china-with-elderly/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 11:28:28 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/future-good-china-with-elderly/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hope that in twenty years, I’ll be a lovely old man, accompanied by a lovely old lady. Not seeking great wealth or status, just good health and the ability to travel around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video-original&#34;&gt;Video original
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Youku search, no further links will be provided&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;script&#34;&gt;Script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I say that in 10 years, the charming old man will be me. I must work hard to become a charming old man. The good future of China will surely be one with kind old men and women. Even if I am 60 years old in 10 years, I will still be the youngest in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, people think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty good for a 50-year-old Chinese man to have this physique. But behind this body is the motto I believe in: the more disciplined you are, the freer you become! When the rain stopped, I wanted to go running, and I’ll play soccer tomorrow afternoon. At 50, I can still play big games – I&amp;rsquo;m not kidding, and often play with professionals. But what&amp;rsquo;s behind it? Discipline. I spend my remaining days running, and some people find running very monotonous. The more disciplined you are, the freer you become. Because of my discipline, I am free to run, never listening to music, because I think listening to my own breath is the most beautiful music for running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I rarely use the treadmill. And a lot of people say Beijing&amp;rsquo;s smog is so bad, but I run five days a week – two days are already reserved for the smog. What’s different about me, though, is that I never stop. Every month, I mark a day in my journal—in my experiences—for each day I run; there are never fewer than 18 days a month. Running just flies by. And when I run, I don&amp;rsquo;t wear glasses, but more importantly, I’m still playing soccer every week. The last class I teach my graduate students will be at my house, and the theme is fun. I think fun is so important; I never deal with people who have no joy or hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To treat them with respect and keep a distance – such people are too frightening. If you don’t find joy, what joy do you have? I really don&amp;rsquo;t have much either. What kind of work do you like? This year, early on, one of my graduate students was assigned to China News Weekly. We had a special series called &amp;ldquo;To…&amp;rdquo; Every year when my graduate students graduated, their final assignment was to write an article about 10 years from now, which I would keep. Then, 10 years later, I would unfold them one by one. I also wrote about turning 50 and writing to 60 – a distant place I never thought I’d reach, far beyond the map, but suddenly it&amp;rsquo;s my next stop. My students, when they were 20 writing to 30, that was a love letter from spring to summer. But when I turned 50 writing to 60, it just became the murmuring of late summer to autumn. Now, I’m writing to 10 years from now – writing about myself, slowly, about my bed, a meal, and the people around my family. That&amp;rsquo;s perfectly normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what kind of person should one be at 60 years old? My premise is very clear. In the preface, this article is quite long. I said that in 10 years, a lovable old man will be me, and I want to work hard to become a lovable old man. For China to be endearing, it depends not only on having more young people who must become citizens, no longer just ordinary folks, energetic young people, and young people who understand the rules. A good future China must have good old men and good old women. Currently, there are already over 230 million people in China over 60 years old. In 10 years, it will definitely exceed three hundred million. That is to say, just considering the population aged 60 and above, if China were a country on its own, it would be among the top five in the world, or even potentially the third largest. Just think about how terrifying that is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. I don’t know if everyone has seen a table online today showing the average life expectancy of various provinces and municipalities in China; Shanghai and Beijing both exceed 80 years old, counting both men and women on average. The average lifespan certainly gives men a significant advantage over women. That means that even when I&amp;rsquo;m 60 in ten years, I’ll be one of the youngest in this third stage of life. As for the future, women retire at an average age of 55, with 25 years remaining until their average lifespan of 80; men retire at 60, with 20 years remaining until their average lifespan of 80! You can’t just spend your time dancing square dances. And I can say that the older sisters and brothers dancing square dances today are a cultural habit and entertainment form brought to them by the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another 20 years, the next generation may still have square dancing, but there will be a significant decrease. The younger generation is no longer an active participant in group activities. Just as older people prefer to travel in tour groups, young people are increasingly opting for independent and self-guided trips. Square dancing will continue, but its scope will certainly shrink. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing good or bad about this; it’s simply the times changing, constantly evolving. When I was 60, I was the youngest member of the team. What kind of person should I be? Chinese painting says that at 60, your ears are attuned – but I definitely wouldn’t listen then, still easily annoyed by things I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be bothered by, and even getting upset when happy. More importantly, what can I do for the younger generation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you do for a good cause? Don&amp;rsquo;t be lazy, don&amp;rsquo;t give in easily, oppose what needs opposing. If someone young might harm your interests, can you stand in front of them? I often have to look at this mirror now, back and forth. A good friend of mine has passed away. Tao Wei used to gather with us frequently at our house, and once told me a true story. We all felt the pain together. The older generation, like Chen Lao, kept everything in their homes – you break open a box, and there are 30-something items tucked under the bed. You tell him, &amp;ldquo;This shirt cost over 500 to buy, now it&amp;rsquo;s being offered as tribute,&amp;rdquo; lighting incense every day. Therefore, our generation is accustomed to battling wits with our parents. How much would something costing 700 bring back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;220&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But it’s easy to cause trouble. Tao Wei once spent over 400 yuan buying a T-shirt for his dad. The T-shirt was really nice, how much did it cost? 99. I wore that style. The next day, things went badly. When he came back in the evening, he asked Tao Wei for 400 yuan and wanted him to buy four more. Today, when I wore it out, Uncle Li and many others praised it. They said that this kind of deception carries a great risk, and you shouldn’t do such things as you get older. I won&amp;rsquo;t mention the specific person in the hospital orthopedic department; elderly people fracture their bones, and the crucial reason is often the shoes bought from street vendors. Of course, this is just about the material aspect. Even when you&amp;rsquo;re old, you still need a spiritual life, you still need curiosity, and you still want to shield young people from the wind and rain – live each day happily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel curious and excited, looking forward to the moment I turn 60, feeling that it will be a beautiful beginning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you everyone&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>My 18th birthday might be a little different from yours</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/my-18th-might-be-different/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The very common term &lt;strong&gt;information fragmentation&lt;/strong&gt;. Since graduating from high school and abandoning the time spent reading novels, it’s been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve sat down to read a book seriously and quietly. Sometimes when I look back, after working for so long, do I even remember what I did each year? Often, by mid-year, I’ve already forgotten many things from the first half of the year. Writing blogs is a good habit; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if much of what I write isn&amp;rsquo;t public – it was originally meant to be read for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most loyal reader is myself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video-original&#34;&gt;Video original
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Youku search, no further links will be provided&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;script&#34;&gt;Script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s 18th birthday is like a gaze filled with anticipation and questioning. Each person occasionally asks themselves, are you the way you wanted to be back then? I worry that nowadays everyone has countless social media circles but no real friends, chatting every day but never having heartfelt conversations, acquiring endless knowledge but remaining far from wisdom. Everyone should ask themself on their 18th birthday: deceiving others is easy, but deceiving yourself is difficult!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone&amp;rsquo;s 18th birthday is like a gaze of expectation and inquiry. You can deceive others, but you can’t deceive your own 18-year-old self. Is today the way you wanted to be when you were 18? I think it&amp;rsquo;s alright. Today, there are so many things that matter more than what I thought about at 18 – material possessions, fame, and so on. I’ve gained them, but on the other hand, I’m still on the journey. When I was 18, I studied journalism at the broadcasting academy, hoping to become a journalist like Farahachi, the best. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m still on that path. That&amp;rsquo;s why people often ask me, Bai Lao (Teacher Bai), why are you still at CCTV? Because I want to be a good journalist. Journalism is still ongoing. It’s the gaze of my 18-year-old self. So I think everyone should occasionally ask their 18-year-old self: Are you living the way you wanted to back then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that truly can&amp;rsquo;t be faked. This is what I looked like when I was 18, and in the blink of an eye, 32 years have passed. Everyone who came to Beijing to go to university would have a photo like this. Back then, there were wrinkled suits on Tiananmen Square, with school badges pinned to their chests. Because there were so few college students at that time, not wearing a badge felt especially proud. My hair was long back then, but I still really like how I looked when I was 18. So many years have passed, and suddenly I realized I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for what I faced at 18 because it quietly shaped me. On May 8th, 1986, I bought a collection of Misty Poetry at the Wangfujing Bookstore. That year, I listened to Cui Jian’s “Nothing To My Name” at the Workers’ Stadium. And today, I suddenly realized that my writing style has been most influenced by Misty Poetry, rock music, and Gu Long&amp;rsquo;s martial arts novels – including my personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did you experience at 18? What might you carry with you on your journey as a result? I&amp;rsquo;m particularly curious about what 18-year-olds are experiencing today. Is it like being carved by knives and axes? But what tools are they using? And what kind of shape has it molded you into? I worry that now everyone has countless social media friends but no real friends, chatting every day without anyone to confide in, with limitless access to knowledge yet so far from wisdom—knowing everything but understanding nothing. It seems like everyone is talking about individuality. But as an observer, I find that today&amp;rsquo;s young people are very much the same. What should you let him experience at 18? I really liked 1986 because it was the best way to resolve 1966.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, a result of chance. It can only truly eliminate the underlying concerns if we experience enlightenment and a resurgence of humanity, along with the growth of each individual – something that happened in 1986. We still need to undergo this enlightenment, and we must further develop a thorough understanding of human nature. Regardless of how much economic progress or change occurs in Chinese society, without genuinely addressing and understanding human nature—controlling its negative aspects while activating its positive ones—there will continue to be many things that concern us. My 18-year-old experience is the same as this generation&amp;rsquo;s; we’ve strayed too far. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget why we started out, now condensed into these four characters: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t lose your original intention.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think no matter how far you go, everyone should ask themselves at 18 years old. It&amp;rsquo;s good to have a photo from your 18th birthday and look at it often to question yourself. What others say is useless. It’s too easy to deceive others, but deceiving yourself is very difficult. I said earlier that when I was 18, I would tell someone who is now 20 years old: you should always let your 18-year-old self be a pair of eyes watching you. And in your twenties, as I mentioned before, try opening many doors; you don’t know which one suits you best. Behind which door… It&amp;rsquo;s quite common in China now to see people in their twenties who are like elderly people, and many young people who are in their seventies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you everyone&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>What kind of journalists does society need?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/what-kind-of-journalists-does-society-need/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It recounts the author&amp;rsquo;s views on the journalistic profession, emphasizing that journalists should possess a social conscience, knowledge base, and perseverance. The author also shares their reflections at age 50, including maintaining curiosity, balancing material and spiritual needs, and contemplating the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video-original&#34;&gt;Video original
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Youku search, no further links will be provided&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;script&#34;&gt;Script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best journalist first has a social conscience, then knowledge reserves, and finally perseverance. It can’t be that you run 100 meters and aren&amp;rsquo;t satisfied, so you just run. I think these three combined—people expect the hidden dangers of vaccine safety to be completely resolved. This is like the milk powder incident – it always progresses through a cycle of problems arising, problems being solved, and thoroughly resolving those problems. Otherwise, what’s the point of journalists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the best journalists first have a social conscience, second have a knowledge base, and third, they can’t just run 100 meters for fun; they need to keep running. I feel that these three combined with my turning 50 this year will make it clear that I seem suited for journalism. I am naturally closely linked to China&amp;rsquo;s 40 years of reform. When I turned 30, I stood on the bank of the Songhua River; when I turned 40, my birthday was entering and exiting the Olympic broadcast in 2008. Turning 50 this year, with the whole country commemorating the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, there is indeed a correspondence. If we talk about a great era turning 40, does China’s 40 years of reform represent enlightenment or confusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that after 40 years of development, China has provided enough material wealth for both the people and the country. However, anxiety and confusion have increased instead of decreased. We thought that becoming strong and prosperous would solve everything, but we discovered that material comfort is just a foundation. It’s relatively easy to escape poverty materially, but it&amp;rsquo;s truly difficult to achieve spiritual richness and become a great nation. The United States is already attacking our high-tech industries; we need to focus on agricultural products. There has always been a saying in this world: it&amp;rsquo;s not easy being number two! How many number twos have there been in the US? Therefore, we will inevitably go through a long period of time to transform this &amp;ldquo;number two&amp;rdquo; mentality into something that surpasses ourselves. I can’t expect to get everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to start in television at 25, and it began with interviews of people. I came into contact with thousands of figures carrying various auras. When I was young, I thought these auras would surely make them happy. But when you get close to them, no, there’s not much connection between the aura and their happiness; sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re even inversely proportional. Just recently, I finished reading “The Last 29 Years of Guo Moruo.” Despite holding high positions like Vice Premier of the State Council, various CPPCC vice-chairmanships, and deputy committee chairmanships without ever being officially criticized, his two sons both died – one committed suicide, and the other likely fell to his death from a height. Could he have been happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you use to measure happiness? When she was in her sixties or seventies, having two sons leave her within a few years couldn&amp;rsquo;t make a former vice premier happy. Many famous calligraphy and paintings can bring happiness, being safely through many years can bring happiness. What more is needed? So I think looking at people’s reading habits is the best mirror. To put it slightly seriously, I feel that the anxiety of many people now comes from thinking too much and reading too little. This is a reply from Mr. Yang Jiang to a young person. Without reading, everyone expects fast food, hoping to find a remedy with just a mobile phone. How could that be possible? I learned to be clever through a clumsy process of studying, and subtraction is done when you read more and more books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don&amp;rsquo;t want to expect everything from everyone, but I hope the proportion increases – that more and more Chinese people can find a better version of themselves through education. That’s what matters most. No one sits on the ground staring at the stars and figures everything out; I can’t do that. But I can look in the mirror. A few years ago, a BBC news anchor came to Beijing, claiming to be their best news anchor. Then some well-meaning person organized a dialogue between Chinese news anchors and him. We had a conversation. During the conversation, he asked me a question: what should BBC learn from CCTV? I joked around first and said, of course, they should start by learning Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I joked that the BBC should learn from CCTV about their curiosity towards the world. I said, haven&amp;rsquo;t we rapidly expanded our presence globally in recent years? We now have over 70 foreign bureaus. Our reporters feel like students, and whenever they see something new abroad, they’re incredibly curious, observing the world with a great sense of wonder. The BBC has already treated Britain as the whole world; you’ve lost your curiosity. My friend slapped the table and said, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve hit the nail on the head! That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we lack.&amp;rdquo; In 2007, when I interviewed an author in Japan, he told me a sentence: “This country has everything except hope.” Later, I understood how profound that statement was. Looking at it from another angle, more than ten years ago, I felt like China lacked everything except hope; everyone felt there was something to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I worry about the day we become a prosperous nation that has everything except hope. To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m very concerned that China will reach a point where it feels truly poor only when it has everything. When I was 50, I feared becoming someone who could satisfy all material conditions but remained a very impoverished person. In our reality, there are many highly educated people lacking in culture, and many poor people with countless numbers in their bank accounts. This is the problem of this era. True poverty isn&amp;rsquo;t scary because it has momentum and hope ahead. That’s why I say we have a moral deficit and a loss of humanity – that&amp;rsquo;s the reason. I think scientists invent so many things not necessarily because they initially carried some grand mission, but out of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was curious whether I could pull it off, so I started pushing myself to be better around the age of 50. That makes me happy. One thing that bothers me now is persistence. We were just talking about you still persisting, and I said don&amp;rsquo;t – once you persist, you’re not far from death. In the past, we always said persistence equals victory. Chinese football would say “persist for three minutes, grit your teeth,” there’s no fun left, no methods left, so it relies on persistence. Persistence is sometimes important, but quite often this statement has two sides to it. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that when I&amp;rsquo;m persisting in doing something, like chatting with everyone now, I insist on finishing everything I have left to say. Actually, my time is up now, but I’m curious, what will the conversation turn out like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give yourself a very small keyword, but engage in conversation with everyone. I think that at 50 years old, as long as you can still maintain great curiosity, there’s no problem. I like all fun things, but not necessarily the most fun things right now; today&amp;rsquo;s trends might disappear in an instant. There are yearly buzzwords – do you remember any? Could today’s internet media possibly be what traditional media dreamed of 10 years ago? So fun things always have their own inherent appeal. I respect everyone’s preferences, there must be a reason for that, but looking at the long term, people still prefer playing mahjong. When you also like eating fast food, restaurants serving elaborate meals will naturally decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things can’t just be passed with a sigh. How much fragmented reading do you have on your phone every day? How many longer readings do you have? But this is also a process, and the phone is becoming our handcuffs. So I think that the more short things you see, the more nearsighted people will gradually become, but this is also a process. I never worry about content being king. You’ll come back. You&amp;rsquo;ll entertain yourself to death every day until you reach 40, just like seeing teenagers drinking cola—you tell them to drink less, but you know they’re going to drink it anyway. But on the other hand, I’m optimistic; at 40, he will definitely return to the world of tea. That&amp;rsquo;s a Chinese person&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s quite normal, but I hope the next change will be a little faster. We’re just expressing our feelings – there are so few investigative journalists these days; you don’t even look at investigations anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you everyone&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>What will China&#39;s football be like in 20 years?</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;These supplementary reading responses were mostly written spontaneously in 2021, and the transcription of Bai Yansong’s speech was done when the pandemic had just begun. Don&amp;rsquo;t talk about twenty years later, even a year or two later—the changes in the world always exceed people&amp;rsquo;s expectations. Now the pandemic in China is nearing its end, but overseas it continues to rage on. Regarding soccer, the national team has been playing quite well in recent years, and the coach dares to play offensively. Compared to those clueless days of old, watching the games with my grandfather is actually a bit interesting now. What kind of experience is it that you’re so bored by a national team game that even an elderly person wants to change channels?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you still curious about Chinese football? Curious, very curious. How could it have gotten so bad? So you find there are many reasons why Chinese football doesn&amp;rsquo;t play well, and one of the reasons is that everyone is afraid to lose the ball on their own side, pass it to someone else – they don’t even do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is just one of many reasons. Talking about 20 years of football, after 20 years, Chinese football feels so distant. The first expansion brought the number to 48. China might go, but it still might not. The best age for a national team is 26~30 – that’s today&amp;rsquo;s 6-10 year olds. Twenty years will make you feel very optimistic; in 20 years, it will definitely work. But when I mention today&amp;rsquo;s 6-10 year olds, your expression immediately becomes serious. So, cause and effect are intertwined. What are we planting today? We almost planted soybeans to have the national team play in a league – what will grow from that? Whoever initiates this action needs to prepare for dismissal; it violates the rules, so I haven’t thought about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we really should think about today&amp;rsquo;s children, aged 6-10 – are they playing soccer? Then you’ll know what Chinese football will be like in 20 years&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Moral deficit, human deficiency</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/moral-deficit-humanity-loss/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;When doing things, the first thing you need is a clear conscience. This will allow you to sleep soundly and avoid making mistakes on matters of principle. If you truly make a mistake, you should do your best to rectify it, not hide or try to forget. Humans are easily forgetful, but also a species with good memories. Peace of mind is the ultimate destination; being able to answer yourself honestly leads to a more relaxed life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;script&#34;&gt;Script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have eight characters that carry a lot of weight: I feel we currently have a deficit in morality, a loss of humanity. Times always progress through a cycle of identifying and solving problems, a logic loop of thoroughly resolving issues. You need to be patient and wait for its reshuffling. For a country like China, many things are a slow process of reshuffling, so don&amp;rsquo;t be pessimistic during the change and the reshuffling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These past few days, China has been battling two typhoons – one invisible and the other visible. The invisible typhoon is the vaccine, which impacts the dams of our inner security. The visible typhoon rarely lands in Shanghai and then affects Beijing and Tianjin; it&amp;rsquo;s unprecedented for three municipalities to face a typhoon together in decades. That’s beside the point. What you need to think about now is whether you can thrive on your own – you’ve undergone significant changes, you have many answers, but if the surrounding environment doesn’t change, will you be happy? I have eight words that are quite weighty: we currently have a moral deficit and a loss of humanity; this is the biggest deficit and the greatest loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what people expect is for the safety concerns of the vaccine to be completely resolved, just like the milk powder incident back then. So sometimes you need to look at history and understand how the establishment and formation of a complete legal framework for the US FDA is also closely related to the unsafe milk powder and dairy products. The Sanlu milk powder incident forced China to make great changes in the dairy industry. While I can’t say the vaccine situation will be continuous, I hope this one will bring it to a halt. You need to know that progress always moves forward through a cycle of problems arising, being solved, and then completely resolved – otherwise, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of journalists? What&amp;rsquo;s the point of citizens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think the only thing each of us can do is to care. But the problem is that Chinese people are too easily forgetful. Like what I just said, after hitting someone&amp;rsquo;s car, we stop on the side of the road and run away; no one stops us. A large proportion of our neighbors and colleagues are like this. So it needs to be changed slowly. And as ordinary citizens, all we can do is pay attention and not forget. It’s not that there’s a lack of something – when people aren&amp;rsquo;t able to eat enough or wear warm clothes, talking about ideals doesn’t have much persuasive power. But once they are well-fed and clothed, and we’ve become the world’s leading diabetes nation, the leading high blood pressure nation, and many other “number one” nations, you see Chinese people starting to run (exercise), Chinese people starting to lose weight. I ask the ladies here, how many of you haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced the harsh reality that if I don&amp;rsquo;t eat a big meal, I won’t have the energy to diet? That’s a small transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the same with the spiritual level we talked about. When you’re well-fed and warmly clothed, and you start exercising or dieting, your spiritual needs gradually increase. For example, I used to smoke, but when I started running, it just happened that one day I realized I hadn’t smoked in over 20 days, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t smoked since. Of course, I won’t say I completely quit—that feels too ceremonial. It’s not excluded that I might still have two or three cigarettes within a year. When your lifestyle changes, many things will change along with it. I think for Chinese people, you need to be patient and wait for the reshuffling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more people feel unhappy, but they won&amp;rsquo;t indulge in their unhappiness. While depression is on the rise, isn’t it also true that more and more people are seeking positive ways to live? This leads to a growth in things related to the spirit. So don&amp;rsquo;t be pessimistic; look at how you see the same thing. I often see drivers cutting in line on the street, which makes me frustrated. But then, in an instant, I become optimistic because the queue on the other side is much longer than before. This is just such a process. All of you here are willing to come to this place and chat about so many useless things on a rainy evening – isn’t that also a fun thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this also a kind of transformation, so there are many things that need to be thought about in a different way. Of course, I think there will be many things that need to grow slowly in the future. For example, you said entrepreneurship – who isn’t an entrepreneur throughout their life? Everyone’s life is essentially entrepreneurial. We&amp;rsquo;ve imbued &amp;ldquo;entrepreneurship&amp;rdquo; with too much of a sense of trendiness. In reality, entrepreneurship has always existed. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t Su Shi an entrepreneur? Wasn&amp;rsquo;t Li Bai an entrepreneur? There will be many creations throughout one&amp;rsquo;s life, ultimately creating their own brand. It doesn’t matter if most don’t succeed; as long as you live a life with enough flavor and feel it was worthwhile. What I think China particularly lacks now is a good value system that views failure as another form of success. Chinese people only accept successful outcomes but don&amp;rsquo;t accept a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; failure as a kind of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;rsquo;s very difficult. So you find many reasons why Chinese soccer doesn’t play well, and one of those reasons is that everyone is afraid to lose the ball if they pass it to someone else, even if it’s just themselves. Without that kind of approach, of course, this is only a small reason. So I feel that after reaching my age, past 30, I wrote about not being in a hurry in the preface, but now at 50 there&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of urgency because time goes by so quickly, so fast, and many things you expect haven’t become reality yet. But on the other hand, it is understood that for a country like China, many things are a slow process of shuffling. You see your parents; some were like traffic lights didn&amp;rsquo;t exist, but occasionally you see their children pulling them along. It&amp;rsquo;s changing, it&amp;rsquo;s shuffling. So I think you need to have some patience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Overall, the country is getting better and stronger. If people&amp;rsquo;s vanity didn’t exist, it wouldn’t be so strong. Looking back from the 1990s to now, in the families I have interacted with, everyone&amp;rsquo;s life has gotten much better than before. At the same time, there are more wealthy individuals. In the process of market-oriented economic development, an increase in income inequality is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues of social stratification and blocked upward mobility that are commonly discussed are systemic problems in the world today. The contributions made by our party regarding the basic welfare and social security of the people should be recognized. Life will get better and better; if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to buy a house, you can rent one. There are also issues with unequal distribution of educational resources when it comes to children’s education, sometimes requiring trade-offs. Do you prioritize better job opportunities and work environment or more time spent with your family? Don&amp;rsquo;t impose your own ideas on others, including your children and family. Sit down and have a good talk; life will always get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thirty-years-old&#34;&gt;Thirty years old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;30 years old&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve turned 50 this year, and I never thought about it before. I thought, &amp;ldquo;This is an old man.&amp;rdquo; Now I realize I really am an old man. This is what I looked like at 30. Didn’t feel very young or handsome at 30, but looking back now at 50, not bad at all. What&amp;rsquo;s the biggest life feeling at 30? Looking back. I think it’s subtraction; the keyword is subtraction. In a sense, experiencing and thinking about things, writing them out and leaving them behind to start fresh on a new blank page – like going for a run. But for me, doing subtraction, whether from myself or as a reminder to all of you, was truly very important at 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently guiding students at United College. I often remind them that before 30, you need to work your hardest on addition – try everything, because you don’t know how many possibilities you have, and you don’t know what opportunities fate will bring. It’s not about knowing &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do it, but some people in their twenties relentlessly pursue various additions, but forget subtraction, forget that there&amp;rsquo;s a time when you need to subtract. I think around 30 is a very important period in life – after doing a series of additions and running around everywhere, it’s crucial to do a subtraction. Otherwise, it will be too late. Why should you subtract? Not everything suits you, not everything is for you. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight lines bind you, how far can you run? They may restrain each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I turned 30, I was promoted exceptionally – in academia that would be a professor, and for a journalist, a senior reporter. I was recognized at 29, and such things are rare now, but it started to bring about a huge confusion. When I worked on the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and received a lot of applause, I suddenly felt something wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite right. I began asking myself, what do you really want to do? What needs to be discarded? That year, I made a very important subtraction – I stopped my program for a year, without appearing overseas. Someone advised me that in the hosting profession, if you don’t appear on camera for just a month, it&amp;rsquo;s manageable, but six months and people will forget you. I said, &amp;ldquo;My face must be pretty cheap.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, we started developing new programs. After going through a period of pain and joy, I took a full year off in 2001. Everything I&amp;rsquo;m doing today is really thanks to the subtraction I did back then. At that time, I could have done so many things – sports, E, lots of other fun stuff, producing, etc. But I said no. I realized I could only do news, and that’s what I should be doing most. So, I was the producer for three programs at the time, and I quit them all overnight, which led to who I am today. I simplified things. Just a few days ago, chatting with colleagues, I said that one very important decision I made in my late 20s wasn’t about having many options; it was about focusing on news. It&amp;rsquo;s like a deep well – there were opportunities for promotion, possibly to become deputy director, but I turned them down and returned to the foundation of an ordinary person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undergraduate student&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a senior-level cadre with China Central Television, and not even definitively graduated with a bachelor’s degree. You understand our system, but I rejected it. I just wanted to see how far a bachelor’s degree could go. Why can’t someone with a bachelor’s degree continuously learn and lead graduate students? Yes, now I supervise graduate students, 11 every year – this is the result of a subtraction. I think that&amp;rsquo;s certainly a reflection on looking back. Also, when you’re young, it’s especially easy to feel in your struggles that you deserve everything. If anything is missing or any matter has a flaw, I feel particularly uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone here should learn to subtract, meaning that around the time you’re approaching 30, when I watched the Olympics in 1996 at age 28, I came up with a sentence: &lt;strong&gt;Imperfection is an important part of perfection; there&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as perfection in this world.&lt;/strong&gt; In Zeng Guofan’s long novel, he actually wrote a very important sentence: What is the best state of life? Zeng Guofan wanted to name his study “Hall of Seeking Absence,” meaning that a flower is at its best when it hasn’t fully bloomed, and the moon is at its best when it isn&amp;rsquo;t yet full. But for ordinary people, they will think this is a defect, not perfect enough, not reaching the extreme. The best way to ruin someone is to have them pursue perfection and reach the ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flower is not fully open&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This world isn&amp;rsquo;t like that. A flower is at its best when it’s not fully bloomed; once it’s in full bloom, it’s close to falling. Once the moon begins to be completely round, it’s close to slowly waning. So I feel this is a very important boost and revelation for my 30th birthday; looking good isn&amp;rsquo;t about being 40. But I feel more relaxed, freer. Why am I no longer in a suit and tie, no longer black and white, but starting to ask about happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forty-years-old&#34;&gt;Forty years old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;40 years old&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a Chinese saying, &amp;ldquo;forty is the age of questioning,&amp;rdquo; but thirty is subtraction and forty is confusion. It’s not really about questioning; I think in this era, most people are confused at 40. My midlife crisis came early, starting around thirty-six or seven, when I began to question whether everything I&amp;rsquo;ve done has value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it have meaning? Do I even know what happiness is anymore? This book was born out of this confusion. When you turn 30, you’ll realize that many of your goals for happiness are tied to material possessions. The idea behind &amp;ldquo;establishing oneself by 30&amp;rdquo; refers to having education and a solid foundation. You need a car and a house; otherwise, the mother-in-law won&amp;rsquo;t agree to marry her daughter to you – it’s very materialistic. But “40 not confused” is difficult. I think ancient people probably had a shorter average life expectancy than now, so they condensed it into 40 years before reaching wisdom. I feel like I’m still confused at 40; &lt;strong&gt;material things haven&amp;rsquo;t brought me the happiness I thought they would.&lt;/strong&gt; That’s also why so many people ask me when I turn 40, are you happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that book titled &amp;ldquo;Waves of Happiness&amp;rdquo;? It&amp;rsquo;s a question mark, representing the confusion in my heart. The birth of a midlife crisis – at 40, you need to answer so many questions for yourself. Around 40, you should chat with yourself more often and read a lot of things to find answers for yourself. I’m very grateful that I entered the world of Tao Te Ching in my late thirties. As I mentioned in &amp;ldquo;White Talk,&amp;rdquo; when you reach 40 and still need to think, if the surrounding environment doesn&amp;rsquo;t change, especially the soft environment – you leave home with a pleasant mood, only to find chaos everywhere, traffic lights being disregarded, fake products, and vaccines…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said that these past few days China has been battling two typhoons, one invisible and one visible. The invisible typhoon is the vaccine, which impacts the dam of our inner security. The other typhoon – China rarely sees typhoons land in Shanghai, but that’s beside the point – what you need to think about next is this: you&amp;rsquo;ve improved yourself, you have many answers, but if the surrounding environment doesn&amp;rsquo;t change, will you be happy? &lt;strong&gt;I have eight characters that I feel are particularly weighty: we currently have a moral deficit and a loss of humanity. This is the biggest deficit and the greatest loss.&lt;/strong&gt; Just a few days ago, not far from here, I witnessed two cars collide; actually, the collision wasn&amp;rsquo;t that serious. The responsible party should have taken responsibility because he hit another car and told them to pull over to the side of the road. The other person also slowly agreed to move over when the car in front suddenly sped off, and no one stopped him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will he be a responsible father? Will he be a responsible son? Let alone how can he be a responsible citizen, and he might be your colleague—that&amp;rsquo;s the moral deficit and the loss of humanity. This will inevitably affect you. No matter how great you are, unless you stay at home, but the problem is that even staying at home doesn’t prevent your children from needing vaccinations; if you deliver food, the food delivery itself could have problems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how can a Chinese person learn to transform from an ordinary citizen into a citizen – this is likely an important question for me personally, at the age of 40, and also for society&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 30 is about subtraction, and 40 is confusion, I think the word I&amp;rsquo;d give myself for 50 should be curiosity. 50 is awkward, neither rooted in the village nor having a shop to go back to; you can advance and make gains, or retreat and just drift along. You can lie on what you’ve achieved for 10 years, and it seems possible to drift into retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently read a book, and it had a very interesting passage stating that truly successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are often in their fifties and sixties – quite different from our concept. Just like China shouldn&amp;rsquo;t treat all volunteers as solely youth volunteers, so too should it not view entrepreneurship entirely as a young person’s pursuit. Last week I did a program about recruiting retired elementary and middle school teachers who will receive an annual subsidy of two or three hundred thousand yuan to teach in rural areas – and they must be excellent teachers. I said this is precisely pioneering the concept of re-employment after retirement, and it&amp;rsquo;s not just charity. However, reaching 50 still feels quite a distance away. How do we move forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifty-years-old&#34;&gt;Fifty years old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 years old&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, for people around 50, there are two challenges. The first challenge is yourself: Are you still curious about many things? What&amp;rsquo;s your worldview like? I think my greatest gain at 50, or how I’m living right now, is &lt;strong&gt;treating each day with kindness. When you were 20, it was easy to live for tomorrow; when you’re not careful at 50, it’s easy to dwell on yesterday. But I work hard to restrain myself, neither living in the future nor the past, but treating each today with kindness. People at 50 shouldn&amp;rsquo;t always say &amp;ldquo;tomorrow&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;yesterday was so good!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the best thing to do today is watch a concert disc of Tsai Chin. She said something really good: &amp;ldquo;Every time I look at photos, I think that two years ago, I looked so beautiful,&amp;rdquo; but in those two years, I never thought I was beautiful myself. That sentence has quite a flavor. When I was 30, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think so; I thought I was handsome then and had many flaws. But looking back now after 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was once young too, I used to have so much hair. So cherish every day you have now, and it would be wonderful to see you again in two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like what Shitein said, when my legs could no longer walk and I was sitting in a wheelchair, I missed the days when I could run and play basketball every day. It was very painful to reminisce about those times every day.
A few more years passed, and I developed pressure sores while in my wheelchair, making me feel terrible all over. At that time, I constantly missed the days from a few years ago when I felt no pain and could quietly sit in my wheelchair.
Years later, I developed kidney failure and now have to undergo dialysis. At this point, I miss the days when all I had were bedsores on my wheelchair. If I don’t live to be 100 with the ability to treat every day kindly, the past 50 years were for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think we should wait until 50 to understand this truth; people should realize it in their 30s or 40s – everything is easily missed. A meal during a trip, if you don’t eat it, even if you eat it 30 years later, it won’t be the same. So my first feeling at 50 is that I should cherish every today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing is curiosity. I find that I can stop being curious about many things at any time, because I’ve seen and experienced so much. But I urge myself to be curious. So now, when I do a lot of things, I approach them with a sense of curiosity – can the phone be held vertically for filming? It can. You go do on-site reporting, participate in what appears to be a grand summit. Can the live broadcast be more relaxed and fun, leaving a deeper impression on everyone? Can it then be disseminated through new media? All possible. I think curiosity is the most important driving force for human progress. Why can’t it be the most important driving force for an individual&amp;rsquo;s progress? Once a nation loses its curiosity, that nation is finished. On a larger scale, 50 is an important test. What kind of vested interest do you become in China at ages forty and fifty? I am very worried that many people around us, hoping to achieve their dreams when they were young, once they realize those dreams and become vested interests, they turn into people who obstruct others from realizing their own dreams. Am I right? And then, they treat young people and things in the way they used to dislike most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a few years ago, I started recruiting 11 graduate students every year as a volunteer, mentoring them for two years, and now we’ve had five graduating classes, totaling 55 pure graduate students who have already graduated. I feel very happy to be in this position of privilege. You gain certain insights, and you also have the ability to guide them. After each day of teaching, I take them out to dinner, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost much. But this is what a good person with privilege should do. Privilege can manifest in two ways: one is to become a stepping stone again. I once said something like, &amp;ldquo;I don’t want to say thank you too much to those who have helped me,&amp;rdquo; because my way of saying thank you is to treat the new young people with double the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If saying “thank you” every day becomes an obstacle, the next step is to pave the way for others. I hope that those with vested interests in China – whether material, economic, ideological, cultural, or in any field – when you become one of them, consider what you should do. The people who pushed the train yesterday became the ones blocking it today; looking back at Chinese history, this pattern repeats everywhere, and it won’t change today either. It might even be more so. Therefore, I urge all those with vested interests to return to how they wanted to act when they were young – hoping to encounter certain kinds of people. Perhaps I haven&amp;rsquo;t done enough in that regard, but at least I am thinking, doing, and saying it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Allocator for standard library containers</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/standard-library-container-memory-allocator/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2019 13:26:19 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/standard-library-container-memory-allocator/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Custom allocators can improve performance, increase memory efficiency, and solve problems related to frequent small memory allocations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cause&#34;&gt;Cause
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on network packet development and frequently need to allocate and release small blocks of memory. I initially thought about using a memory pool, but after reviewing several existing ones, I found this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/cacay/MemoryPool&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/cacay/MemoryPool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the interface, I was a bit puzzled – the implementation of this memory pool seems a little strange. The &lt;code&gt;MemoryPool&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s implementation logic allocates fixed-size memory spaces. Having looked at the boost memory pool interface, it provides a template that is instantiated when used. Fortunately, there are already articles introducing this library, mentioning the concept of &lt;code&gt;allocator&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;wikihttpszhwikipediaorgwikie58886e9858de599a8_c2b2b&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E5%99%A8_%28C%2B%2B%29&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In C++ programming, an allocator (in English: allocator) is an important component of the C++ standard library. The C++ library defines various data structures collectively referred to as &amp;ldquo;containers&amp;rdquo; (such as linked lists, sets, etc.), and a common feature of these containers is that their size can change at runtime; to achieve this, dynamic memory allocation becomes particularly necessary, and allocators are used to handle the container&amp;rsquo;s memory allocation and release requests. In other words, an allocator encapsulates the low-level details of memory management for Standard Template Library (STL) containers. By default, the C++ standard library uses its own built-in general allocator, but according to specific needs, programmers can also customize allocators to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allocator was originally invented by Alexander Stepanov as part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), with the initial goal of creating a way to &amp;ldquo;make the library more flexible and independent of the underlying data model,&amp;rdquo; allowing programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types within the library; however, when incorporating the Standard Template Library into the C++ standard, the C++ Standards Committee realized that complete abstraction of the data model would result in unacceptable performance losses. As a compromise, the restrictions on allocators in the standard became stricter, and as a result, the current standard describes allocators with significantly less customizability than Stepanov originally envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are limitations on allocator customization, custom allocators are often necessary in many cases, typically to encapsulate access methods for different types of memory spaces (such as shared memory and recycled memory) or to improve performance when using memory pools for memory allocation. In addition, introducing a dedicated custom allocator in programs that frequently allocate small amounts of memory can also be greatly beneficial from the perspectives of memory usage and runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the primary reasons for defining custom allocators is to improve performance. Utilizing a dedicated custom allocator can enhance program performance, or increase memory efficiency, or both [4][8]. The default allocator allocates storage space using the new operator, which is often implemented using C language heap allocation functions (malloc()) [Wen 5]. Because heap allocation functions are often optimized for occasional large memory allocations, the default allocator generally performs well when allocating memory for containers that require a large amount of memory to be allocated at once (such as vectors and double-ended queues) [8]. However, for associative containers and doubly linked lists, which require frequent allocation of small amounts of memory, using the default allocator can often result in low efficiency [4][9]. In addition, malloc()-based default allocators have many problems, such as poor locality of reference [4] and potential memory fragmentation [4][9].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, this section (……) is like a &amp;ldquo;I Have a Dream&amp;rdquo; speech for this standard regarding allocators. Before the dream comes true, programmers concerned with portability will limit themselves to stateless custom allocators.
——Scott Meyers, 《Effective STL》
In light of this, in such situations, memory pool allocators are often used to address the problem of frequent small allocations [8]. Unlike the default &amp;ldquo;on-demand allocation&amp;rdquo; approach, when using a memory pool allocator, the program pre-allocates a large block of memory (the &amp;ldquo;memory pool&amp;rdquo;), and then, when memory is requested, the custom allocator simply returns a pointer to memory within the pool; during object destruction, no actual deallocation is required, but it is delayed until the end of the memory pool&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle [Note 1][8].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of &amp;ldquo;custom allocators&amp;rdquo; has seen considerable discussion among C++ experts and authors, such as Scott Meyers&amp;rsquo; work &amp;ldquo;Effective STL&amp;rdquo; and Andrei Alexandrescu&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Modern C++ Design.&amp;rdquo; Meyers observed that if you require all instances of an allocator for a given type T to be equal, then the allocator instances must not contain state. Although the C++ standard encourages library implementers to support allocators with state [Reference 4], Meyers calls this related passage a “seemingly wonderful idea” but also almost empty talk, and he considers the restriction on allocators &amp;ldquo;too strict&amp;rdquo; [4]. For example, STL&amp;rsquo;s list allows the splice method, where nodes of one list object A can be directly moved into another list object B, which requires that the memory allocated by A’s allocator can be released by B’s allocator, thus inferring that the allocator instances of A and B must be equal. Meyers concludes that allocators are best defined as types using static methods. For example, according to the C++ standard, an allocator must provide an other class template that implements the rebind method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in &amp;ldquo;The C++ Programming Language,&amp;rdquo; Bjarne Stroustrup argues that “&amp;lsquo;strictly limiting the allocator to avoid different object information&amp;rsquo; is clearly not a big deal” (in essence) and points out that most allocators do not need state, and performance may even be better in the absence of state. He proposes three use cases for custom allocators: memory pool-based allocators, shared memory allocators, and garbage collection allocators, and demonstrates an implementation of an allocator that utilizes an internal memory pool to quickly allocate/deallocate small amounts of memory. However, he also mentions that such optimization may already be implemented in the sample allocator he provides [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another use of a custom allocator is debugging memory-related errors [10]. To do this, you can write an allocator that allocates extra memory when allocating, and use it to store debug information. This type of allocator not only ensures that memory is allocated/deallocated by the same allocator, but also protects the program from cache overflows to a certain extent [11].&lt;/p&gt;</description>
