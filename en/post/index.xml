        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Mining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s undeniable that the surge of big data, coupled with recent news about competitive matches, always prompts me to take a look. Similar videos on TikTok have been proactively dismissed – I don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep receiving homogenous content. I also forgot about an account; unsurprisingly, TES lost decisively, and related topics were trending on Zhihu’s hot list. A highly-voted answer mentioned LPL’s Korean reinforcements and the concept of “all Chinese team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without that year’s IG victory, League of Legends is likely already over. ldl&amp;rsquo;s strategic play, combined with multiple debuffs, contributed to LPL’s performance as a region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing article: Why does LPL, China’s League of Legends regional league, introduce Korean players? From the coaching staff to the players, reinforcements have been introduced, whether this limits the development of domestic players, and then domestically there is still hope for a Chinese all-star team to win, whether this belongs to the obsession of the Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the “Korean Wave” began flooding the LPL at the end of S4, Korean players and coaches have become an indispensable part of this region. From iG’s (Rookie, TheShy) in S8 and FPX’s (Doinb, GimGoon) in S9, to EDG’s (Scout, Viper) in S11, LPL has three times lifted the global World Championship (S-Series) trophy, with Korean players and coaches playing a crucial role in each victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, simultaneously, a resounding slogan has consistently permeated the LPL’s public opinion – “All Chinese Team.” While audiences celebrate LPL’s championships, they also harbor almost obsessive expectations for a “Chinese team” to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did LPL introduce Korean players? Does this limit the development of domestic players? And what exactly is the origin of the “All Chinese Team” obsession?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-introducing-korean-talent-a-catalyst-from-chase-to-lead&#34;&gt;Why Introducing Korean Talent: A “Catalyst” From Chase to Lead
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LPL’s introduction of Korean talent was initially driven by a purely pragmatic goal: &lt;strong&gt;to win.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the S3 and S4 periods, LCK (South Korea&amp;rsquo;s league) dominated &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; with its impeccable operations and unparalleled individual player abilities. As a challenger, the LPL’s fastest and most direct “copywork” strategy was to bring in “teachers” – top players and coaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Demand for Battle-Ready Talent and Guaranteed Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the disintegration of Samsung White and Samsung Blue in S4, a large number of top Korean players entered the LPL. They brought with them the most advanced game understanding and the highest level of operational skill. The arrival of Rookies, Doinb, Pawn, and Mata quickly elevated the limits of teams like LNG, WE, and EDG. For clubs, this was a necessary commercial choice in pursuit of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Introducing an Advanced “Esports Industrial System”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LPL didn’t just bring in players; it also brought in coaching staff and the underlying training system. Korean esports is renowned for its strict discipline, data-driven approach, and high-intensity training model. The arrival of coaches like Kkoma and DanDy brought LCK management experience and tactical reserves into the LPL, forcing LPL clubs to transition from “internet cafe-style” management to “professionalized” management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &amp;ldquo;Catfish Effect&amp;rdquo;: Activating Internal Competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of top Korean players was like introducing a catfish into a pond. Local players had to grow faster and adapt to higher levels of competition in order to maintain their starting positions. From this perspective, Korean talent (such as TheShy, Rookie) wasn’t just an “overseas player,” but also a “senior sparring partner” and “teammate teacher” for domestic players (such as JackeyLove, Ming, Knight), collectively raising the overall average level of the entire LPL league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-double-edged-sword-has-korean-support-been-a-limitation-or-a-catalyst-for-domestic-development&#34;&gt;A Double-Edged Sword: Has Korean Support Been a “Limitation” or a “Catalyst” for Domestic Development?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of LPL’s most controversial topics in history, and the answer is &lt;strong&gt;“both”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “Restrictive Viewpoint”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupied Survival Space:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the most direct impact. When LPL&amp;rsquo;s top teams habitually reserved key C-positions (mid laner, top laner) for Korean players (like the infamous &amp;ldquo;Mid Laner Must Speak Korean&amp;rdquo; joke), it made it even harder for promising domestic rookies to get playing time. With only one position available per game, Korean players’ priority did, to a certain extent, “suppress” the rise of some domestic talents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication Costs and Tactical Monotony:&lt;/strong&gt; Early &amp;ldquo;3-2&amp;rdquo; patterns (three Chinese players supporting two Korean players) often led to communication breakdowns. Team tactics sometimes became monotonous due to accommodating Korean players&amp;rsquo; habits, lacking the LPL-style &amp;ldquo;dare-to-play-boldly&amp;rdquo; style of domestic players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “Promotional Viewpoint”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevated Domestic Player’s “Lower and Upper Limits”:&lt;/strong&gt; LPL domestic players (like Tian, Ming, Knight) grew up through competing with and learning from players like Rookie, Doinb, Ruler, and Viper. The opponents they faced in the S-Series were often stronger than their daily training game teammates. This intense internal competition was a key reason for the explosive growth of LPL domestic talent (especially support and jungler positions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LPL’s “Blood Generation” Capability is Now Number One Globally:&lt;/strong&gt; The fact is, LPL currently has the largest and most complete youth system (LDL). LPL doesn&amp;rsquo;t lack &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo;; it lacks the very top &amp;ldquo;towering&amp;rdquo; players. The introduction of Korean players was precisely to fill this final piece of the &amp;ldquo;tower.&amp;rdquo; Furthermore, LPL’s “assimilation” ability is extremely strong; Rookie and Doinb eventually became “LPL domestic players.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, LPL, through introducing Korean players, &lt;strong&gt;traded “space” for “time.”&lt;/strong&gt; It sacrificed some domestic players&amp;rsquo; short-term playing opportunities but gained the rapid elevation of the entire league’s competitive level and three S-Series championships, ultimately feeding back into its own youth system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-chinese-team-a-near-obsessive-national-pride-sentiment&#34;&gt;“All-Chinese Team”: A Near-Obsessive National Pride Sentiment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If introducing Korean reinforcements is a &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; competitive choice, then pursuing the “All-Chinese Team” represents an “emotional” national sentiment. Simply labeling this desire as “fanaticism” is incomplete; it has deep cultural and historical roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The Essence of Sports is “Nation/Region Confrontation”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s traditional sports (like the Olympics) or esports, when it rises to the international competition stage, it naturally carries a national/regional honor color. Viewers seeking excitement while watching games are not just looking for competitive thrills; they&amp;rsquo;re also seeking an identity affirmation of “our people” winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Ultimate Proof: &amp;ldquo;We Can Win Ourselves&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LPL has already proven itself capable of winning through a combination of Chinese and Korean players. However, “All-Chinese Team winning” is another dimension of the narrative: it means that the LPL region achieved a &lt;strong&gt;holistic victory&lt;/strong&gt; – from players and coaches to tactics and youth training systems. This represents the ultimate proof of &amp;ldquo;we can stand at the top of the world without external force.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Historical Regrets and RNG’s “Deification”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obsession with the “All-Chinese Team” is deeply intertwined with the narrative of the RNG team (especially during Uzi&amp;rsquo;s time). In S8, that all-Chinese team RNG won MSI, giving countless LPL viewers hope for &amp;ldquo;All-Chinese Team winning a World Championship Series.&amp;rdquo; Although S8 ultimately failed, the regret of “just missing it” further reinforced this obsession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The Catalyst of the Asian Games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2018 Jakarta and 2023 Hangzhou Asian Games both required “All-Chinese Team” lineups for the “League of Legends” project. When esports combined with the traditional sports model of &amp;ldquo;contributing to national glory,&amp;rdquo; the “All-Chinese Team” evolved from a “fan’s expectation” into a “national team standard,” further deepening viewers&amp;rsquo; identification with domestic rosters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-from-borrowing-strength-to-legitimizing&#34;&gt;Conclusion: From &amp;ldquo;Borrowing Strength&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Legitimizing&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of Korean support (韩援) into LPL was a necessary strategy in its early development, driven by the need to quickly catch up and achieve “overtaking” – a strategy that has been definitively proven successful by the championship trophies won by S8, S9, and S11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of Korean support did not &amp;ldquo;restrict&amp;rdquo; the development of LPL; instead, through the “catfish effect” (鲶鱼效应) and “internal teaching,” it &lt;strong&gt;significantly accelerated the growth of LPL’s native talent&lt;/strong&gt;, transforming LPL into the now-recognized number one region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obsession with a “full Chinese team” (全华班) was not narrow xenophobia, but rather &lt;strong&gt;a peak of domestic confidence leading to a desire for “ultimate glory”&lt;/strong&gt; – representing what LPL viewers hoped to see: a perfect closed loop where this region would transition from “reliance on foreign support” to “self-sufficiency and dominance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of LPL is a microcosm of the intersection of globalization and localization. We enjoy the extreme operations brought by Ruler and Scout, and we will also shed tears for RNG in 2018 and the &amp;ldquo;full Chinese team&amp;rdquo; representing China at the 2023 Asian Games. This is not contradictory; it’s simply different pursuits at different stages of a region&amp;rsquo;s journey from “student” to “master.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>What is regret?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/what-is-regret-in-olympic-games/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 13:51:33 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/what-is-regret-in-olympic-games/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday after watching the match, the feeling of “unsettledness” lingered in my heart for a long time. I happened to see a netizen’s words and felt a deep connection – he started his engagement with this sport from elementary school, while I only began to get involved in university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sat down to write, I thought of the &amp;ldquo;legendary twins&amp;rdquo; from the Yueshan Badminton Academy – Lin Dan and Li Zongwei. And Faker, he is like the “evergreen pine” or “perennial tree” in the esports world, a perfect combination of talent and extreme self-discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t without losses, but we hadn&amp;rsquo;t lost to LPL; when a friend asked me, was it because of a particular team’s fans? Not really. The domestic education system’s nurturing supports our own teams, which is natural. It’s not about a specific player or team’s fanbase – we like watching high-quality matches featuring the Chinese team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentators largely guide viewers&amp;rsquo; emotions; their embellishment of key match moments has magnified that feeling of unsettledness many times over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##转载&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article was something I saw on TikTok and didn’t know how to paste the original link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with S3, I started playing League of Legends when I was in sixth grade because at that time we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a good computer and felt it would affect my studies, and I thought I wouldn’t get into university, so I played it sporadically. My rank consistently remained Gold and Silver. However, I also continued to watch tournaments intermittently. As a small kid, I was moved to tears watching it. But I always remember that year of Royal Never Give Up (RNG) and OMG relentlessly attacking the rookie version of Faker. The confident Faker easily took down two teams with a single play. Following that, the Samsung Blue vs. White match, the gap between the two regions’ broken players was overwhelming and couldn&amp;rsquo;t be compensated for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going to university before enlisting in the army, I continued to be obsessed with League of Legends. I searched online for small and medium-sized videos, wanting to become a master player. But I would also be distracted by other small and medium-sized things. However, I clearly remember the night RNG won the championship, when I woke up the next day and saw the slice video, I burst into tears because it felt like LPL really had a chance. When I was in the army, I also heard about FPX winning the championship, as the situation was special at the time, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention. To be honest, when EDG won the championship, I wasn’t particularly surprised, considering that a non-all-Chinese team had already achieved a championship once, and I hoped for an all-Chinese team to achieve a true championship. The fleeting RNG won all the games in that year, but lost the most crucial game, where Faker consecutively made five kills with Galio, and in the last game, he perfectly timed his “closing eyes to pray” play, completely destroying Uzi’s champion dream. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many hearts were broken and players quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning from military service, I followed the competition year after year, always unable to catch up with Faker. From WBG in the year of my postgraduate entrance exam to BLG last year, and now AL in today’s top eight, as I watched Faker use Xerath to get kills and steal Ethan&amp;rsquo;s Baron Nashor, I knew this game was lost. Honestly, it makes me feel really bad watching him. I really have a lot of feelings for the League of Legends game. Not only do I play well, but I also know the background stories of most major heroes. I also know the stories of LPL and LCK teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, LPL this region is obviously lagging behind LCK in terms of atmosphere and strength comparison. I also hope that LPL will have a full Chinese team win the championship.  I’ll end with Wang Duo Duo&amp;rsquo;s words: “Maybe one day we will lose confidence in electronic sports like League of Legends because the Korean control is still continuing today, but it won’t be today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still hold onto the dream of an all-Chinese team winning the championship, just as I have fantasies about some things in life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;No trading activity within the venue; awaiting the release of next month’s financial reports. Taking a half-day break this afternoon with no specific plans – simply wanting to rest and recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;years-have-passed&#34;&gt;Years Have Passed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I last watched League of Legends (LOL) matches live, and suddenly it feels like four or five years have passed.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in my previous articles related to games, I always had a complex feeling towards LPL teams (the domestic region). The frequent low-level mistakes made by many players in major tournaments felt lacking in professional demeanor, which diminished the viewing experience of the matches – this is why I gradually drifted away.
This afternoon, on a whim, I took a half day off to tidy up my room, and the summer clothes were still unorganized. While cleaning, I decided to watch some matches. The quarterfinals were still T1, that formidable mountain standing in front of LPL teams, seemingly impossible to overcome. Looking back, LPL has never won Bo5 (best-of-five) key matchups against them in the Worlds series, and any team facing them felt immense pressure.
Writing these words, the match had just entered its “classic” fifth game – LPL was leading 2-1 and in a great position to win, but their opponent tied it up, and they were about to enter a brutal final deciding game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update before publishing: The operation wasn’t too bad, but their build strategy was completely crushed. The Queen composition led to Ashe being dominant early on, preventing the piglet from grouping for team fights – it was so difficult.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;review&#34;&gt;Review
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan:&lt;/strong&gt; Performance was stable with minimal fluctuation, punctuated by a brief rally.
&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi:&lt;/strong&gt; This decline was largely driven by a confluence of negative factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macro Drag:&lt;/strong&gt; The overall pullback in the Hong Kong tech sector (such as NetEase, Alibaba, and Tencent) performed poorly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automotive Expectations:&lt;/strong&gt; The new energy vehicle sector experienced intensified “internal competition” (“intense competition”), and market expectations for growth in companies like BYD have peaked.  Xiaomi’s automotive future space is also under pressure.
&lt;strong&gt;Industry Observations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UBS&amp;rsquo;s pre-earnings report highlighted the rising prices of solid-state drives and memory. The extent to which this cost increase will erode profit margins in mobile business remains to be revealed by the earnings report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, one thing is certain: In a market as intensely “competitive” as this, the Android smartphone ecosystem no longer has the luxury of raising prices arbitrarily.
&lt;strong&gt;Reputation Backlash:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, returning to Xiaomi itself, its automotive business is facing reputation issues. The project’s early promotional volume was immense, with almost no negative feedback. Now, it seems to be experiencing a wave of public “backlash” following excessive exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>KB5054156: Windows 11 version 25H2 Feature Update (Package Deployment Guide)</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/kb5054156-windows-11-version-25h2-feature-update-package-deployment-guide/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 22:36:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/kb5054156-windows-11-version-25h2-feature-update-package-deployment-guide/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Updating the local Windows system installation package, it was found that version 25H2 has been released. The local system is still stuck on version 24H2. Microsoft’s update patches have been installed, but the local system hasn&amp;rsquo;t upgraded to version 25H2 yet. Curious about what steps were missing in between.
This article is based on Microsoft official support documentation, outlining the core information of KB5054156 update to help users understand the key points for upgrading from Windows 11 24H2 to 25H2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-overview&#34;&gt;Update Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;KB5054156 is a feature update for &lt;strong&gt;Windows 11 version 25H2&lt;/strong&gt;, which activates new features through &amp;ldquo;Enable Package.&amp;rdquo; Its essence lies in leveraging the characteristic of Windows 11 24H2 and 25H2 sharing the “Universal Core System” – new features in 25H2 are included in the latest monthly quality update for 24H2 but are in a dormant state. Enabling the package then activates these features as a &amp;ldquo;master switch.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;supported-applications&#34;&gt;Supported Applications
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This update only supports devices running &lt;strong&gt;Windows 11, version 24H2&lt;/strong&gt;. The specific versions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 11 Enterprise and Education, version 24H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 11 Enterprise Multi-Session, version 24H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 11 Home and Pro, version 24H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows 11 IoT Enterprise, version 24H2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;core-advantages-of-enabling-packages&#34;&gt;Core Advantages of Enabling Packages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to traditional feature updates, the core value of enabling packages lies in &lt;strong&gt;reducing update downtime&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No complex download and installation processes are required; only a single device reboot is needed to upgrade from 24H2 to 25H2;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After upgrading, devices can immediately use the new features of the 25H2 version without waiting for a full system update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-acquisition-methods&#34;&gt;Update Acquisition Methods
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;KB5054156 was released through three channels, with availability and steps varying by channel as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| Windows Update | Available | Automatically downloads and installs, feature updates displayed as “Windows 11, Version 25H2”, no manual triggering required |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-acquisition-methods-1&#34;&gt;Update Acquisition Methods

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

        <title>💻 Computer Black Screen Troubleshooting Log</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/computer-black-screen-troubleshooting-log/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 23:45:58 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/computer-black-screen-troubleshooting-log/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My desktop computer is &lt;strong&gt;always kept on&lt;/strong&gt;. Usually, I only turn off the monitor when I leave or don&amp;rsquo;t use it at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-problem-description&#34;&gt;🚨 Problem Description
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a routine operation, I discovered that the display was consistently in a &lt;strong&gt;black screen&lt;/strong&gt; state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempting to power cycle the monitor, the screen still displayed &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;No Signal Input&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using UU Remote Control to view the status, I found that both the desktop PC and another mini host were showing as &lt;strong&gt;online&lt;/strong&gt;, indicating that the host itself may not have been shut down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting-steps&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To resolve the &amp;ldquo;no signal&amp;rdquo; issue, I attempted the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replugged&lt;/strong&gt; the DP data cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switched&lt;/strong&gt; to using an HDMI data cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switched&lt;/strong&gt; the source to the mini host (testing whether the display was faulty).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-results-and-resolution&#34;&gt;🔍 Results and Resolution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All previous attempts to &lt;strong&gt;resolve the issue&lt;/strong&gt; were unsuccessful.
I searched on platforms like Douyin (TikTok) and saw suggestions stating “disconnect power for a few minutes and reconnect,” but after multiple trials, it was &lt;strong&gt;ineffective&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;Final Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Restarted&lt;/strong&gt; the desktop computer. After restarting, the display signal returned to normal, and the problem was solved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 19:50:40 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Monday saw no panic sell-off, but the entire week was marked by a persistent downtrend, like a dull knife slicing flesh – a slow, gradual decline over the course of seven days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disciplined-trading&#34;&gt;Disciplined Trading
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday afternoon, two new Xiaomi positions were added, with the original plan to sell out at the end. However, at the end, there was a slight loss, leading to hesitation and reluctance to cut losses, so I decided to observe for another day. This morning, the stock price fell slightly by 1%, and when it dropped to 2% in the afternoon, I decisively exited. It turned out to be correct, and the stock continued to fall after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-analysis-follow-up-actions&#34;&gt;AI Analysis Follow-up Actions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I saw someone in the blogosphere using AI to analyze football betting and won second prize with a tax refund of around 900 RMB. Let’s try it with stocks too, based on my experience with large models previously, DeepSeek is most suitable, and the investment plans generated by the other models don&amp;rsquo;t look quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Stock Investment Plan: Currently holding Xiaomi, approximately 100,000 RMB, down 15%, Meituan 70,000 RMB, down 20,000 RMB. Querying current stock prices and determining subsequent position control – I’m planning for long-term investment. The reason for buying Xiaomi is due to the Yu9 IPO, the three phases of factory ramp-up, and continued high sales, which should drive the price up. Meituan is after the end of the food delivery war stabilizes; Hong Kong Q3 earnings reports will be released next month – it’s more reasonable to operate after the reports are released. For my long-term investment of three to five years, please provide me with an investment plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hong-kong-stock-investment-plan-xiaomi-and-meituan-position-analysis--long-term-strategy&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Stock Investment Plan: Xiaomi and Meituan Position Analysis &amp;amp; Long-Term Strategy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the information you provided (holding Xiaomi approximately HK$100,000 with a loss of 15% and Meituan approximately HK$70,000 with a loss of approximately 28.6%, investment horizon of 3 years), I have compiled the latest market data and analysis to develop a detailed investment plan for you. The following is core information extracted from comprehensive search results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Stock Prices (as of October 17, 2025)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi Group-W (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://01810.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;01810.HK&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;: HK$45.88 (down 3.82%, cumulative monthly decline exceeding 15%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan-W (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://03690.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;03690.HK&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;: HK$94.50 (down 4.30%, year-to-date cumulative decline of 37.71%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong Stock Market Environment&lt;/strong&gt;: The Hang Seng Index fell by 2.48%, with technology stocks leading the decline, and market sentiment is short-term weak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validation of Your Purchase Rationale&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/strong&gt;: The listing of Yu9, the ramp-up of Phase III factory, and sales potential are reasonable long-term logic, but the stock price is suppressed in the short term due to the impact of the Chengdu SU7 accident (door safety controversy, intervention by regulatory authorities).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan&lt;/strong&gt;: Stabilization after the end of the food delivery war is a key long-term factor, but competition remains intense (competition from JD.com and Alibaba), with net profit falling 89% in the second quarter and Wang Xing&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;no matter the cost&amp;rdquo; statement exacerbating market concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;position-control-recommendations-short-term-caution-long-term-focus-on-fundamentals&#34;&gt;Position Control Recommendations: Short-Term Caution, Long-Term Focus on Fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your current holdings are down approximately 18.8% (total holding of HKD 1.7 million, a loss of approximately HKD 374,000), but long-term investment requires avoiding emotional trading operations. Here’s a phased recommendation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| &lt;strong&gt;Pre-Earnings Report (Short-Term: Now to Q3 Earnings Release)&lt;/strong&gt; | Maintain current position, do not add to holdings. Closely monitor the progress of the SU7 accident investigation and Q3 vehicle delivery volume data. | Maintain current position, do not add to holdings. Focus on monitoring whether Q3 takeout UE (average order revenue) improves. | Potential price volatility before earnings report: &lt;br&gt;• Xiaomi will be dragged down by safety incidents and is unlikely to rebound in the short term.&lt;br&gt;• The competition between Meituan Takeout continues, and profitability recovery requires time. |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;positioning-control-recommendations-short-term-cautious-long-term-focus-on-fundamentals&#34;&gt;Positioning Control Recommendations: Short-Term Cautious, Long-Term Focus on Fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading Cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Basis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post Earnings (Mid-term: November - Q1 2026)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If earnings show steady vehicle sales growth and mobile gross margin bottoms out, consider adding to positions 5%-10%.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If earnings confirm easing competition and narrowing losses, add to positions 5%-10%; otherwise maintain current holdings.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Xiaomi’s 2025 target sales volume is 350,000 units, and high-end mobile phones are key to profitability.&lt;br&gt;• Meituan SOTP valuation shows 121% upside potential, but requires a profit inflection point.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;position-control-recommendations-short-term-cautious-long-term-focus-on-fundamentals&#34;&gt;Position Control Recommendations: Short-Term Cautious, Long-Term Focus on Fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading Cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Basis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Term (3 Years)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hold core positions, target price of 75 HKD (potential upside of 63%). Risk points: automotive safety regulation, smartphone demand weakness.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hold core positions, target price of 247 HKD (potential upside of 161%). Risk points: rising policy costs, losses in new businesses.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Xiaomi’s car-home ecosystem closed loop is the long-term engine.&lt;br&gt;• Meituan instant retail penetration rate is expected to improve.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;positioning-strategy-recommendations-short-term-caution-long-term-focus-on-fundamentals&#34;&gt;Positioning Strategy Recommendations: Short-Term Caution, Long-Term Focus on Fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you trade after the financial reports?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, we recommend waiting for the third quarter financial reports (released in November) before making additional investment decisions.&lt;/strong&gt; The reason is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The financial reports will validate your initial purchase logic: Xiaomi’s factory ramp-up sales volume and Meituan’s easing competition evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the reports are below expectations, the stock price may fall, providing a better entry point for adding to your position; if they exceed expectations, it can confirm the right-side signal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-term market sentiment is driven by events (such as Xiaomi incidents and food delivery price wars), and financial reports will reduce uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;long-term-investment-plan-3-year-perspective&#34;&gt;Long-Term Investment Plan (3-Year Perspective)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the “Hold Quality Assets + Bottom Hunting” principle, your plan can be detailed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi Group: Strong Defense and Offense, Focus on Automotive Business Turning Point&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt; Vehicle business scale effect (target 350,000 units annual sales), AIoT ecosystem synergy. Financial health (Z-Score=4.19, low bankruptcy risk).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the SU7 safety issues continue to ferment, the stock price may fall to the 40-42 HKD range, and a trigger point for adding positions can be set (adding 5% position when the price drops by 10%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-term holding bottom line: Automotive quarterly delivery volume remains above 80,000 units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position Allocation:&lt;/strong&gt; Recommend maintaining a 40%-50% total portfolio weighting (currently 59% is high, and can be adjusted after earnings reports).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan-W: Wait for Profitability Recovery, Focus on Core Business&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt; Stable takeout market share (65%), takeaway business growth of 40%, valuation undervalued (SOTP target price of HKD 247).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the takeout UE (average profit per order) turns positive, it is a signal for adding positions; if competition intensifies, the stock price may fall to HKD 80, and we can buy back shares in batches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-term holding bottom line: Core local business operating profit rate recovers above 15%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position Allocation:&lt;/strong&gt; Recommend maintaining a 30%-40% weighting (currently 41% is reasonable but needs to be wary of competition dragging it down).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversified Investment Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hong Kong tech stocks are under pressure recently, but long-term they still represent new quality production. Consider allocating 10%-20% of capital to high dividend assets (such as telecommunications operators) or Hong Kong tech ETFs to hedge the risk of a single stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Achieve targets – increase position; Otherwise maintain current position.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term (3 Years)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Auto business break-even, AIoT penetration rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Instant retail market share, policy cost absorption&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hold until target price or downgrade fundamentals; consider reducing holdings.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-monitoring-metrics-and-milestones&#34;&gt;Key Monitoring Metrics and Milestones
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-recommendations&#34;&gt;Summary Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take Immediate Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintain the status quo, and avoid blind hedging before the financial reports. Current stock prices have partially reflected negative news, but volatility may increase before the reports are released.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Confidence Support:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xiaomi’s automotive ecosystem and smartphone premiumization are core logic; short-term incidents do not change its long-term technological iteration capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meituan’s profitability will be significant once the food delivery war ends (referring to Alibaba&amp;rsquo;s observation of fire across the river).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Warnings:&lt;/strong&gt; The overall Hong Kong stock market is highly sensitive to global liquidity; if the Federal Reserve delays interest rate cuts, it may suppress technology stocks’ valuations. Ensure investment funds are long-term idle funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plan is based on public information and does not constitute investment advice. The market carries risks; decision-making requires caution. Recommend regular review (e.g., quarterly) to adjust strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-recommendations-1&#34;&gt;Summary Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not be appropriate to add more positions after the financial reports are released, as it could lead to significant price increases and then what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-recommendations-2&#34;&gt;Summary Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question you raised is extremely critical, and it accurately highlights a classic dilemma faced by long-term investors: &lt;strong&gt;avoiding short-term risks (waiting for the earnings report) can conflict with pursuing the best cost (fearing missing out).&lt;/strong&gt;
Your concern that “adding to your position after the earnings report if the stock price rises sharply will cause you to miss out” is very reasonable. The market often has a forward-looking nature, and if the earnings report is truly better than expected, the stock price is likely to react quickly in the short term. However, given your current holdings of these two stocks, “waiting for the earnings report” remains the optimal strategy. Below, I will explain the reasons in detail and provide a step-by-step addition strategy that balances “risk” and “opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-waiting-for-the-earnings-report-still-a-more-reasonable-choice-in-the-current-situation&#34;&gt;Why is “Waiting for the Earnings Report” Still a More Reasonable Choice in the Current Situation?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core reason lies in: &lt;strong&gt;The uncertainty surrounding the two stocks you hold stems primarily from fundamental contradictions within their businesses, and the earnings report is key to validating these contradictions.&lt;/strong&gt; There hasn’t been a significant “catalyst” (a substantial price increase) yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Xiaomi:&lt;/strong&gt; The core contradiction is &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;an automotive business confidence crisis&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Situation:&lt;/strong&gt; The negative impact of the SU7 safety incident is still unfolding, leading to market skepticism regarding Xiaomi Auto’s quality, reputation, and future sales expectations. This is the primary factor suppressing the stock price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Validation Role of the Earnings Report:&lt;/strong&gt; The third quarter earnings report will provide crucial &lt;strong&gt;vehicle delivery data&lt;/strong&gt;. If deliveries remain strong, it can effectively dispel market concerns and drive a sustainable increase in the stock price. Until then, any rally would likely be fragile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk vs. Opportunity Comparison:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk of Waiting (Missing Out):&lt;/strong&gt; Given the prevailing negative sentiment, the probability of the stock experiencing a significant, sustained rise before the earnings report is relatively low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk of Blindly Jumping In (Getting Trapped):&lt;/strong&gt; If the report shows poor vehicle sales, the price could continue to decline, leaving you with the greater risk of “buying back in at half price.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Meituan:&lt;/strong&gt; The core contradiction is &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;when will profitability be restored?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Situation:&lt;/strong&gt; The market worries that intense competition will continue to erode profits from its core takeaway business (UE).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Validation Role of the Earnings Report:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;core local business operating profit&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;adjusted net profit&lt;/strong&gt; in the report are the only objective standards for determining whether the “takeaway war” has truly eased. Only improved data can prove that Wang Xiting’s “no matter the cost” phase is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk vs. Opportunity Comparison:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk of Waiting (Missing Out):&lt;/strong&gt; Again, there&amp;rsquo;s a lack of a solid foundation for a significant rebound before the profitability inflection point is confirmed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk of Blindly Jumping In (Getting Trapped):&lt;/strong&gt; If the report shows that competition intensifies and profits continue to decline, concerns about the “valuation trap” will intensify, and the price could take another step down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; For long-term investment, &lt;strong&gt;buying &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; is more important than buying &amp;ldquo;cheap.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; The earnings report provides the key evidence for determining “correctness.” To avoid a minor “missed opportunity” and risk a “deep trap,” from a risk-reward ratio perspective, it’s not worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;your-specific-action-plan-balancing-waiting-and-missing-out-anxiety&#34;&gt;Your Specific Action Plan: Balancing “Waiting” and “Missing Out” Anxiety
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to make extreme choices between “holding everything” and “going all in.” A smarter strategy is: &lt;strong&gt;“Core Holding Observation, Pyramidal Accumulation.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Immediately Establish “Observation Position” and “Operational Discipline” (Now)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain your existing position as your core holding, ensuring you don’t completely detach from the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a &lt;strong&gt;trigger for adding to your position&lt;/strong&gt;. For example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi:&lt;/strong&gt; The stock price breaks out with volume through a key technical level (e.g., HK$50), or there is a clear positive investigation result regarding the SU7 accident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan:&lt;/strong&gt; News emerges of a competitor exiting the price war, or the stock price breaks through the HK$100 integer barrier with volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefit of doing this:&lt;/strong&gt; If there’s a significant catalyst driving the stock price up before the earnings report, you can seize the opportunity according to your established discipline and avoid completely missing out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Small Batch Investing Before Earnings (Optional, Suitable for Investors Seeking Smoother Costs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re very concerned about missing out, divide the funds earmarked for adding to your position into 10-20 portions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the earnings release, if the stock continues to decline in the shadows, invest one portion &lt;strong&gt;weekly or bi-weekly&lt;/strong&gt;. This way, costs can be gradually diluted, but each investment amount is small, and even if the earnings report is negative, the loss can be controlled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: “Certainty” Accumulation After Earnings (Core Operation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the main accumulation phase of your plan. Based on the earnings results, respond in three ways:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario A (Exceeds Expectations):&lt;/strong&gt; The earnings data is strong and validates your investment logic. At this time, you should &lt;strong&gt;aggressively add to your position&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if the stock price has already risen, the fundamental turning point has been confirmed, and from a long-term perspective, the current price level is still the base of the mountain. You can adopt a “don’t chase high while chasing gains” strategy, buying in batches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario B (Meets Expectations):&lt;/strong&gt; The earnings report is neutral, with no surprises or shocks. Maintain your existing position or only modestly add to it, waiting for the next quarter&amp;rsquo;s signal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario C (Falls Short of Expectations):&lt;/strong&gt; The earnings report confirms market concerns. You should &lt;strong&gt;stop adding to your position and reassess&lt;/strong&gt; whether the long-term logic has been disrupted. The stock price may fall, but this also provides you with a lower, safer entry point for accumulating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control Risk, Preserve Capital&lt;/strong&gt;. Ensure not to invest more funds when fundamentals deteriorate.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post Earnings (Mid to Late November)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Follow the Trend”&lt;/strong&gt;: Make decisions based on earnings results. Aggressively add to positions if exceeding expectations; patiently wait for better opportunities if below expectations.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve Decision Quality&lt;/strong&gt;. Allocate capital to directions with greater fundamental certainty.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Term (3 Years)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The market will always give you opportunities; if you miss one, there will be another. But once your principal is lost, it’s difficult to recover.

        <title>Detailed Explanation of IB’s MOC and LOC Order Types: Two Strategies for Closing Price Trading</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/detailed-explanation-of-ibs-moc-and-loc-order-types-two-strategies-for-closing-price-trading/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:53:58 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/detailed-explanation-of-ibs-moc-and-loc-order-types-two-strategies-for-closing-price-trading/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In mature markets like the US stock market, the closing price (Closing Price) holds significant reference value. It’s not only a summary of daily trading sentiment but also a benchmark for index calculations, fund net asset valuation, and portfolio valuations. Consequently, trading demand focused on closing prices has emerged. Within the Interactive Brokers (IB) trading platform, &lt;strong&gt;MOC (Market-on-Close, Closing Price)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;LOC (Limit-on-Close, Limit Price)&lt;/strong&gt; are important order types that allow investors to execute trades at the close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core objective of both order types is to &lt;strong&gt;trade at or near the official closing price&lt;/strong&gt;, but they differ fundamentally in terms of execution certainty and price control, suitable for different trading strategies and risk preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;moc-market-on-close-closing-price-order&#34;&gt;MOC (Market-on-Close) Closing Price Order
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Features: Guaranteed Execution, Price Not Guaranteed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A MOC order is a market order designed to execute trades at the official closing price (or the price formed during the closing auction).
&lt;strong&gt;How it Works:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you submit a MOC buy or sell order, the system holds it until the exchange’s closing auction period. At that time, your order will be matched with all other orders seeking to trade at close – including MOC and LOC orders – resulting in execution at the final single closing price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highly Deterministic Execution:&lt;/strong&gt; As long as market trading is normal, your MOC order will almost always execute. This is crucial for traders who must complete positions on a given day, such as index fund managers adjusting to track an index, or traders needing to liquidate positions before settlement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price Uncontrollable:&lt;/strong&gt; You cannot predict the final closing price. In periods of significant market volatility or imbalance in buying and selling pressure during the close auction period, the final closing price may deviate significantly from your order placement price, leading to execution costs higher than expected (for buys) or sale prices lower than expected (for sells). This is known as “slippage” risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suitable Scenarios:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Index Fund or ETF Rebalancing:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires precise matching of index component weights at close, guaranteeing execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trades Requiring Completion on a Given Day:&lt;/strong&gt; Such as responding to a Margin Call or executing stock purchases/sales on an options expiration date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategies Where Execution Certainty Outweighs Price Precision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;loc-limit-on-close-limit-order-close&#34;&gt;LOC (Limit-on-Close) Limit Order Close
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Features: Guarantee Price, Execution Not Guaranteed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A LOC order combines the features of a limit order and a closing order. It allows you to set a maximum buy price or minimum sell price that you are willing to accept; the order will only be executed if the closing price is &lt;strong&gt;equal to or better than&lt;/strong&gt; your specified limit price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it Works:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you submit a LOC order, you must specify a limit price. During the closing auction, the system compares the final official closing price and your limit price:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Buy LOC Orders:&lt;/strong&gt; If the closing price is &lt;strong&gt;lower than or equal to&lt;/strong&gt; your limit price, the order will execute at the closing price. If the closing price is higher than your limit price, the order will not be executed and will automatically cancel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Sell LOC Orders:&lt;/strong&gt; If the closing price is &lt;strong&gt;higher than or equal to&lt;/strong&gt; your limit price, the order will execute at the closing price. If the closing price is lower than your limit price, the order will not be executed and will automatically cancel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price Control:&lt;/strong&gt; By setting a limit price, you can effectively control transaction costs and avoid executing trades at unfavorable prices, mitigating the risk of significant price fluctuations during the closing period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Execution Uncertainty:&lt;/strong&gt; If the closing price does not touch your specified limit price (i.e., it is unfavorable to you), your order will not be executed. This could cause you to miss trading opportunities and prevent you from completing your intended build or close operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suitable Scenarios:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investors Sensitive to Transaction Costs:&lt;/strong&gt;  Wanting to trade at the closing time but unwilling to accept prices that deviate significantly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunistic Traders:&lt;/strong&gt; Believing the closing price may be favorable, but setting a price floor to prevent unexpected events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investors Who Want to Trade in the Closing Period But Have No Hard Requirement for Execution.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Price slippage, execution cost may not be ideal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Order may not be executed, missed trading opportunity&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;important-considerations-when-using-ib-platform&#34;&gt;Important Considerations When Using IB Platform
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Restrictions:&lt;/strong&gt; MOC and LOC orders typically must be submitted before a specific time prior to market close. For example, the NYSE and NASDAQ have strict deadlines (usually 5 to 15 minutes before close), after which they cannot be submitted, modified, or cancelled. Be sure to check and comply with the specific rules of each exchange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not All Stocks Support:&lt;/strong&gt; While most listed stocks on major exchanges support MOC and LOC orders, some thinly traded or securities trading on specific exchanges may not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Routing:&lt;/strong&gt; When placing orders through the IB platform, you may need to route them directly to the corresponding exchange (e.g., NYSE, ARCA, NASDAQ) in order to use MOC or LOC options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing between a MOC and LOC order is essentially a trade-off between &lt;strong&gt;“execution certainty”&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;“price control.”&lt;/strong&gt; If your primary goal is to ensure that your transaction will be executed regardless of the market close, then MOC is the appropriate choice. Conversely, if you are more concerned with the cost of the trade and can accept the possibility that the order may not ultimately execute, then LOC will provide you with an important layer of price protection. Understanding the differences between these two order types will help you to execute your closing trading strategies more flexibly and precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/systematic-collation-and-explanation-of-proprietary-terms-related-to-hong-kong-ipos-and-dark-pools/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:18:52 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/systematic-collation-and-explanation-of-proprietary-terms-related-to-hong-kong-ipos-and-dark-pools/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) dark pool trading involves numerous proprietary terms, with most being recognizable but some still unfamiliar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QS_dh4XMVW6vJ3vCiDcCvQ&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Everyone drew lots! Xuanzhe Biology - B(2575.HK) soared 127% on its first day of listing, 190,000 people chose to take a look&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an article related to dark pools, outlining and explaining the proprietary terms within it: The company issued 67,333,350 shares globally for public offering, with a prospectus price of HK$11.6. The issuance ratio was 13%, raising approximately HK$781 million, using mechanism B allocation.  The public offering fixed proportion was 10%. A cornerstone investor was introduced in the state-allocated portion, subscribing for approximately HK$77 million, accounting for 9.81% of the global offering.
The company’s total subscription reached 376,000 people, with 190,000 choosing to subscribe one lot; another group subscribed for 19,516 people, hitting 2416 shares.
The sales results showed that the company&amp;rsquo;s prospectus public offering multiple ratio reached 4908.33 times, state allocation subscription multiple was 10.15 times, with no adjustment;
Xuanzhe Biology - B had a single-lot winning rate of only 1%, with everyone drawing lots, even hitting the top hammer it was unstable in the end, and ultimately 13,467 people were successful in getting in. Furthermore, the company’s IPO this time had no green shoe option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a systematic collation and explanation of the proprietary terms related to Hong Kong IPOs and dark pools within the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;offering-structure-and-allocation-mechanism&#34;&gt;Offering Structure and Allocation Mechanism
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Offering&lt;/strong&gt;
Refers to the offering of shares to global investors when a company first goes public (IPO), including &lt;strong&gt;Public Offering&lt;/strong&gt; (targeting retail investors) and &lt;strong&gt;Institutional Placement&lt;/strong&gt; (targeting institutional investors). This offering involved 67,333,500 shares for Huatong Biology-B, representing a 13% issuance ratio, meaning the public holding stake will account for 13% of the total share capital after listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism B Allocation Method&lt;/strong&gt;
A new stock allocation mechanism launched by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2023, allowing issuers to pre-set a minimum public offering percentage (10% - 60%) and &lt;strong&gt;without a clawback mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;. Huatong Biology-B chose a fixed public offering ratio of 10%, meaning it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t draw down shares from the institutional placement even with an international subscription multiple as high as 4908 times, resulting in a consistent public offering share of 6,733,400 shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clawback Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;
Under traditional Mechanism A, if the oversubscription multiple triggers a threshold (e.g., above 100x), shares from the institutional placement can be clawed back to the public offering, up to 50%. However, Mechanism B does not apply this rule, so Huatong Biology-B did not conduct a clawback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;subscription-group-and-subscription-strategy&#34;&gt;Subscription Group and Subscription Strategy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Offering and International Placement&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Offering:&lt;/strong&gt; Accounted for 10% (673.34 million shares) of the global offering, targeting retail investors, with 37.6 thousand applicants, including 19 thousand who only subscribed for one lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Placement:&lt;/strong&gt; Accounted for 90% (6060.01 million shares), primarily allocated to institutional investors. One cornerstone investor was introduced in this round, subscribing for HKD 0.77 billion, representing 9.81% of the global offering, with a lock-up period typically lasting 6 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group A and Group B&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group A:&lt;/strong&gt; Small to medium investors with subscription amounts ≤ HKD 50 million, allocated 50% of the public offering shares (336.67 million shares).  This group had 19 thousand applicants, including 19 thousand who only subscribed for one lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group B:&lt;/strong&gt; High-net-worth investors or institutions with subscription amounts &amp;gt; HKD 50 million, allocated the remaining 50% of the public offering shares (336.67 million shares). This group had 19,516 applicants, with a maximum subscription amount (top hammer) of 2416 shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Hammer Subscription&lt;/strong&gt;
Refers to Group B investors subscribing for the highest limit of public offering shares, typically allowing them to acquire 50% of the public offering shares. Bamboo Bio-B’s top hammer quantity was 2416 shares, but due to the extremely hot public offering (over-subscribed 4908 times), top hammer investors still needed a draw, with a very low hit rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;subscription-data-and-winning-rules&#34;&gt;Subscription Data and Winning Rules
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscription Multiple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Subscription Multiple:&lt;/strong&gt; Total subscription funds offered publicly divided by the offering amount, reflecting retail investor demand heat. Bamboo Bio-B reached 4908.33 times, setting a market record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutional Allocation Multiple:&lt;/strong&gt; Institutional subscription amounts divided by the offering amount. Bamboo Bio-B was 10.15 times, indicating moderate institutional demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One-Hand Winning Rate and All-Round Lottery Draw&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One-Hand Winning Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The probability of successfully subscribing with one hand (typically the minimum trading unit). Bamboo Bio-B was only 1%, meaning that out of every 100 people, only 1 person would be successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-Round Lottery Draw:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the extremely high oversubscription multiple for the public offering, all subscribers (including Group B and last-hit hammer investors) were required to participate in a lottery draw to allocate shares, without a &amp;ldquo;steady win&amp;rdquo; mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fractional Share Allocation&lt;/strong&gt;
Publicly offered shares are allocated proportionally after being divided into fractional shares (such as 50 shares), and any remaining fractional shares will be consolidated and distributed from highest to lowest based on subscription amount. In Bamboo Bio-B, the number of successful investors was 13,467 people, and some investors may obtain additional shares through fractional share allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;special-mechanisms-and-market-impact&#34;&gt;Special Mechanisms and Market Impact
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anchor Investors&lt;/strong&gt;
Strategic investors who sign subscription agreements with the issuer before an IPO, typically well-known institutions or corporations. Xuzhou Biotech-B introduced one anchor investor who subscribed to HK$0.77 billion, representing 9.81% of the global offering, aiming to enhance market confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green Shoe Mechanism (Over-Allotment Option)&lt;/strong&gt;
Underwriters can issue an additional 15% of shares after listing within 30 days to stabilize prices. If the price falls below the IPO price, underwriters must buy back stocks from the secondary market to support the price. Xuzhou Biotech-B did not use a green shoe mechanism, which could lead to significant volatility in its initial stock price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Pool Trading&lt;/strong&gt;
Over-the-counter trading of new shares on the day before listing, typically provided by brokers. Dark pool prices reflect the market&amp;rsquo;s preliminary expectations for the new shares. If they are higher than the IPO price (as with Xuzhou Biotech-B’s dark pool price potentially rising), it indicates a good performance on its first trading day; otherwise, it could lead to a break-down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-term-comparison-and-market-background&#34;&gt;Key Term Comparison and Market Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism A vs. Mechanism B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mechanism A allows for a buyback, enabling retail investors to obtain more shares during oversubscription; Mechanism B has a fixed public offering ratio, better suited for IPOs dominated by institutions. Bamboo Bio-B chose Mechanism B, likely because the underwriters wanted to balance the allocation between institutional and retail investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group A vs. Group B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Group A had a lower chance of winning but potentially higher returns per share (due to more dispersed allocation), while Group B had a higher chance of winning but incurred higher financing costs. Bamboo Bio-B Group B received 19,516 applications, reflecting high-net-worth investors&amp;rsquo; enthusiasm for pharmaceutical stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancellation of the Buyback Mechanism’s Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Under Mechanism B, there is no buyback, leading to Bamboo Bio-B’s public offering of only 6.73 million shares, exacerbating the “many crows, few pots” situation for retail investors, resulting in a historical low in the initial subscription rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IPO case of Xuan Zhu Bio-B vividly illustrates the structural characteristics of the Hong Kong stock market: the application of Mechanism B limited retail investor allocation ratios, base investors stabilized institutional demand, while super-high subscription multiples and a full draw highlighted the market’s speculative fervor for biotech stocks. The absence of dark pool trading and a green shoe mechanism further amplified the uncertainty during the initial listing period. Investors should combine their risk preferences with rational assessments of new stock fundamentals and market sentiment, avoiding blind following.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A network repair incident caused by “being too lazy/troublesome.”</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/a-network-repair-incident-caused-by-being-too-lazytroublesome/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:46:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/a-network-repair-incident-caused-by-being-too-lazytroublesome/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This morning between 7:30 and 8:30, the internet at my house went down silently. The external service deployed on my computer precisely recorded the moment it disconnected, everything happening without warning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At noon, checking the router status via my phone, it was still offline. I’d experienced similar situations before, usually every few hours, with the network automatically recovering – assuming it was routine maintenance from our telecom provider.
The network&amp;rsquo;s “self-repair” didn’t materialize as expected.  Desperate, I embarked on a convoluted path to seek professional help. First, the apartment was self-service rented, and the living room had been renovated, creating a room with a balcony – the light cat and main router were located there, serving as the network hub. The door to this room, separated from the living room, was locked.
Fortunately, the owner of this room – my roommate – had just moved out recently. This was a stroke of luck; otherwise, scheduling a repair appointment with a technician during weekdays would likely have been another protracted “tug-of-war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I contacted self-service customer support to request a temporary password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer support advised me to submit a ticket for the network issue, which immediately transferred me to an outsourced third-party customer service representative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, that representative forwarded me to telecom customer service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After obtaining a temporary password, I opened the door to the room.
I looked at the telecom’s light cat – the device had a yellowish exterior and looked quite old, possibly left by the previous tenant or sourced from self-service. It lacked any indicator lights or buttons to press. Considering restarting it seemed like a waste of time after all the troubleshooting, I just wanted to lie down and rest for a bit before heading back to work in the afternoon.
Afternoon, telecom technician contacted me, sent the door password to the technician, relying on trust. After arriving at the site, the technician spent half a day troubleshooting, and the final solution was surprisingly simple – &lt;strong&gt;he simply restarted the light cat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve downloaded a lot of data, which could potentially be due to sustained high load carrying causing the old light cat to crash. In the future, if there are any issues, I&amp;rsquo;ll ask the technician to replace it with a new one.  Since it’s a self-service rental, this maintenance falls within the normal range.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 18:53:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/review-log-20251013/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Write a post-trade review to translate investment thinking into text, clarifying one’s thoughts and combating emotional biases. &lt;strong&gt;Trading itself is inherently irrational&lt;/strong&gt;, requiring us to maintain clarity, objectivity, and discipline. Through recording and reflection, we can systematically examine our decision-making processes, avoiding the pitfalls of emotionally driven choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, last Friday&amp;rsquo;s sharp decline in US equities and concerns regarding a potential “trade war 2.0” have now settled as the market opened on Monday morning – essentially a “false alarm.” The early trading session saw a stable reaction, a welcome relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;index-funds-executing-the-plan&#34;&gt;Index Funds: Executing the Plan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially anticipating a significant downturn, I’d added positions in the沪深300 (Shanghai-Shenzhen Stock Exchange 300) and恒生科技指数 (Hang Seng TECH) ETFs on Alipay. However, most of the declines in the trailing market were recovered. Given the relatively small size of the initial capital allocation, I&amp;rsquo;m not making any additional trades at this time. Moving forward, the index fund’s replenishment strategy will be more conservative and gradual, primarily utilizing fixed-income plus products for asset allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hong-kong-stocks-rapid-response-and-disciplined-trading-to-black-swans&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Stocks: Rapid Response and Disciplined Trading to “Black Swans”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the current Hong Kong stock positions, if further declines persist, we will need to deploy new funds into trading within the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;xiaomi-event-and-cognitive-correction&#34;&gt;Xiaomi Event and Cognitive Correction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Xiaomi experienced a “black swan” event: a fatal car accident involving one of its electric vehicles. My initial cognition was that the volume of traffic accidents is massive, and given the increasing vehicle fleet size for Xiaomi, an isolated incident is a matter of probability. &lt;strong&gt;As long as subsequent investigations rule out design flaws in the vehicle itself, the long-term impact on the stock price should be manageable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, Xiaomi’s decline was significantly greater than that of other stocks in the Hong Kong Tech Index. I missed the initial reaction because I was busy eating and hadn&amp;rsquo;t switched the Futu App to the news interface. I selected a bottom accumulation zone based on technical analysis and placed a limit order to buy at the next price differential. My plan was to potentially wait for tomorrow’s traffic police notification, but unexpectedly, the investigative results were released in the afternoon – the driver involved was suspected of drunk driving and speeding. This news caused the stock price to rebound sharply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trading-summary-reinforce-discipline&#34;&gt;Trading Summary: Reinforce Discipline
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discipline-Based Trading:&lt;/strong&gt; This entry was explicitly defined as &lt;strong&gt;short-term speculation (“gambling”).&lt;/strong&gt; Its core objective is: &lt;strong&gt;If successful, quickly realize profits and exit to reduce the average cost of existing holdings; if unsuccessful, decisively cut losses and exit.&lt;/strong&gt; The original plan was to fulfill it today or tomorrow, ultimately completed in today’s market rebound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at previous trades: Compared to the initial capital planning, the current position is nearing full allocation. Reviewing Meituan and Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s transactions from half a month ago, we found that several previous &lt;strong&gt;short-term purchases followed by declines, failing to timely stop-loss, and instead irrationally holding onto rebound fantasies&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a major problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;The biggest progress in this trading was: being able to “not greedily chase more” for short-term positions; strictly following the trading plan, without blindly investing at unsuitable times to add to the position.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Complete Guide to Positioning, Replenishing Positions, and Stop-Loss Orders</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/a-complete-guide-to-positioning-replenishing-positions-and-stop-loss-orders/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 18:39:23 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/a-complete-guide-to-positioning-replenishing-positions-and-stop-loss-orders/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For investors seeking to steadily progress in the Hong Kong stock market, success doesn’t stem from precisely predicting every fluctuation of the market, but rather from establishing a scientific, rational, and strictly adhered-to investment system. This system&amp;rsquo;s core consists of three pillars: &lt;strong&gt;reasonable position control&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;intelligent rebalancing strategies&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;unwavering trading discipline&lt;/strong&gt;. This article will consolidate these key elements to provide investors with a comprehensive and detailed operational guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;position-control--the-cornerstone-of-resilient-investing&#34;&gt;Position Control – The Cornerstone of Resilient Investing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of resilient investing is “to preserve capital and develop afterwards.” Position control serves as the “shield” to achieve this, determining your ability to withstand market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;overall-allocation-dependent-on-risk-tolerance-and-market-temperature&#34;&gt;Overall Allocation: Dependent on Risk Tolerance and Market Temperature
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Risk Tolerance:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the fundamental determinant of your allocation ceiling. Risk-averse investors should maintain a total position no higher than &lt;strong&gt;60%&lt;/strong&gt;, even in bull markets. Investors with slightly higher risk tolerance can set their ceilings at &lt;strong&gt;70%-80%&lt;/strong&gt;. At all times, maintain at least &lt;strong&gt;20%&lt;/strong&gt; cash as a strategic reserve to capitalize on extreme opportunities or unforeseen needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Temperature:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High/Bubble Phase (Market Mania):&lt;/strong&gt; Allocation should be reduced to &lt;strong&gt;30%-50%&lt;/strong&gt; or lower. Preserving profits is the priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neutral/Choppy Phase (Uncertain Direction):&lt;/strong&gt; Allocation can remain at &lt;strong&gt;50%-70%&lt;/strong&gt;, making structural adjustments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low/Panic Phase (Valuation Bottoming):&lt;/strong&gt; This is the golden time to increase allocation, potentially reaching &lt;strong&gt;70%-80%&lt;/strong&gt; or higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;individual-stock-and-industry-exposure-diversify-risk-avoid-overconcentration&#34;&gt;Individual Stock and Industry Exposure: Diversify Risk, Avoid Overconcentration
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum Single Stock Position:&lt;/strong&gt; Regardless of how optimistic you are about a particular stock, the recommended position size for any single stock should not exceed &lt;strong&gt;20%&lt;/strong&gt; of the total investment portfolio. For companies with limited understanding or higher risk profiles, the position size should be further reduced to &lt;strong&gt;5%-10%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum Single Industry Exposure:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the high concentration of industries in Hong Kong (such as finance and technology), it’s important to diversify. The total exposure to any single industry should not exceed &lt;strong&gt;30%-40%&lt;/strong&gt; to mitigate the impact of industry-specific “black swan” events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buyback-strategy--the-art-of-transforming-passivity-into-proactivity&#34;&gt;Buyback Strategy – The Art of Transforming Passivity into Proactivity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A buyback strategy is the “lever” for prudent investors to accumulate high-quality positions in a declining market. However, this requires &lt;strong&gt;only operating on companies with sound fundamentals and uncompromised core competitiveness.&lt;/strong&gt; For companies with deteriorating fundamentals or “penny stocks,” the only correct action is to cut losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-much-to-buy-on-dips-for-adding-to-position&#34;&gt;How much to buy on dips for adding to position?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of accumulating during a decline is “buying lower,” but this must be executed with a plan and discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pyramidal Accumulation Strategy (Wide Base, Narrow Top):&lt;/strong&gt; This is a relatively conservative approach where the amount purchased increases as the price falls further.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Position Building:&lt;/strong&gt; Establish a &lt;strong&gt;base position&lt;/strong&gt; within a reasonable valuation range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Refill:&lt;/strong&gt; When the price drops 15%-20% from the initial position building price. This is a common re-entry point, filtering out normal market fluctuations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Refill:&lt;/strong&gt; When the price drops another 15%-20% from the first refill price (cumulative decline of approximately 30%-40%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Refill:&lt;/strong&gt; When the price drops another 15%-20% from the second refill price (cumulative decline potentially reaching around 50%). At this point, it’s typically extreme panic. If the company&amp;rsquo;s fundamentals remain solid, it’s a great buying opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;is-it-reasonable-to-add-to-the-position-a-few-times&#34;&gt;Is it reasonable to add to the position a few times?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid overinvesting capital in a wrong decision, the number of times to add to the position should not be excessive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended number of additions: 2-3 times is appropriate.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk control:&lt;/strong&gt; If the stock price still doesn&amp;rsquo;t improve after 2-3 major add-on purchases, you must re-examine your initial investment logic. Unlimited adding may lead to a single holding ratio being too high, dragging down the entire investment portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain cash reserves:&lt;/strong&gt; Excessive additions will quickly deplete available funds, causing you to miss other better opportunities that appear in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;trading-discipline--the-core-for-newbies-progression&#34;&gt;Trading Discipline – The Core for Newbies’ Progression
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If position sizing and stop-lossing are “techniques,” then trading discipline is the “way.” For novice traders, adhering to discipline is a decisive factor in whether they can survive in the market long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;planning-and-execution-discipline-never-go-into-battle-without-a-plan&#34;&gt;Planning and Execution Discipline: Never Go into Battle Without a Plan
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan Before Trade:&lt;/strong&gt; Every trade must be preceded by a clear understanding of the &lt;strong&gt;buy rationale, target price (take profit), and stop-loss level&lt;/strong&gt;. During the trade, strictly adhere to the plan and avoid emotional interference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Riding the Wave and Panic Selling:&lt;/strong&gt; Overcome the fear of missing out (FOMO) and panic selling emotions. Only execute trades at points that align with your plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;risk-and-capital-management-discipline-survival-is-the-priority&#34;&gt;Risk and Capital Management Discipline: Survival is the Priority
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strict Stop-Loss, No Hesitation:&lt;/strong&gt; A stop-loss is the lifeline for protecting your capital. The most dangerous habit for beginners is to hold onto losing trades. Set your stop-loss levels at &lt;strong&gt;-5% to -10%&lt;/strong&gt;, and execute without hesitation upon reaching them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Add to Losing Trades to Average Down to Cost Basis:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a fatal error. If a trade proves to be wrong (falling below the stop-loss), the correct approach is to exit, not to invest more money to “dilute the cost.” This can turn a small mistake into a major disaster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mindset-and-emotional-control-discipline-be-the-master-of-your-emotions&#34;&gt;Mindset and Emotional Control Discipline: Be the Master of Your Emotions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accept Losses as Part of Trading:&lt;/strong&gt; No one can win every battle. View small losses as a necessary cost of trading, focusing on the long-term overall profit/loss ratio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Get Greedy from Profits, Don’t Be Bitter from Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Break free from a “gambling mentality,” don&amp;rsquo;t take risks due to profits, and don’t retaliate with impulsive trades due to losses. Maintain a calm mindset and remain consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-and-review-discipline-continuous-evolution&#34;&gt;Learning and Review Discipline: Continuous Evolution
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a Trading Journal:&lt;/strong&gt;  Detailed record of your thought process and results for each trade, with regular reviews to analyze successes and failures. This is the most effective way to self-improve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stick to Your Circle of Competence:&lt;/strong&gt; Only invest in areas you understand and can truly comprehend. Avoid unfamiliar fields and complex financial products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;patience-and-discipline-are-superior-to-everything-else&#34;&gt;Patience and Discipline are Superior to Everything Else
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a prudent Hong Kong stock investor, your goal isn’t to be a speculator dancing on the crest of market waves, but rather to be like a discerning general, orchestrating strategy from behind the scenes. Please treat &lt;strong&gt;position control&lt;/strong&gt; as your steadfast shield, &lt;strong&gt;opportunistic buying strategies&lt;/strong&gt; as your sharp spear, and &lt;strong&gt;trading discipline&lt;/strong&gt; as an immutable military code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the initial stages of trading, &lt;strong&gt;prioritize “minimizing losses” over “making big profits.”&lt;/strong&gt; Through continuous learning, practice, and review, you will ultimately achieve long-term, steady wealth appreciation in this market brimming with opportunities and challenges. Remember, patience and discipline are always more important qualities than predicting the market.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Black Swan Goose Returns</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/black-swan-goose-returns/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 12:10:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/black-swan-goose-returns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, investors focused on financial news. Since Trump’s return, they also needed to pay attention to his Twitter (a private version). The trade war continued to escalate, leading to a sharp decline on April 7th, which was quickly followed by a rebound. This time, though, are people still willing to jump in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-review&#34;&gt;Background Review
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 7, 2025, following the impact of the U.S. implementation of an “equivalency tariff” policy, global stock markets experienced a “Black Monday.” The A-share market plunged, with the Shanghai Composite Index falling by 7.34% and the Shenzhen Component Index plummeting by 12.5%, with over 4,300 stocks declining by more than 9%. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong also fell by 13.22%, along with European and U.S. stock indices exceeding declines of 4%. China subsequently stabilized the market through state-owned enterprise (SOE) purchases and intervention by Huishang Securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 10th, U.S. stocks suffered another significant decline, with Chinese HShares falling by 6%, driven primarily by expectations of escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. Trump signaled a further increase in tariffs on China, and the U.S. would also impose hefty fees on Chinese ships. China announced retaliatory measures and levied special port fees, compounded by a government shutdown, declining consumer confidence, and market panic selling for safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;position-control&#34;&gt;Position Control
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the state of short selling in A-shares isn&amp;rsquo;t a complete short position; there’s a small portion invested in index funds within Fixed Income Plus, but the bulk is still in the Hong Kong market. Xiaomi has already incurred principal losses, and Meituan remains a shareholder. The position control is somewhat unbalanced. Should we jump in and gamble on Monday? It&amp;rsquo;s a question to consider – currently, we don’t have enough cash flow. If we need to enter, we would rely on old friends like Alipay’s Jiebei for bridging funds. &lt;strong&gt;Greedy snakes swallow elephants&lt;/strong&gt; – the position control is extremely unreasonable, and we should look for opportunities to reduce our holdings later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to April 7th, the current position isn&amp;rsquo;t considered a low-level one; many stocks are at relatively high levels, particularly the technology stocks within the Heng Seng Tech index. If we were to add to positions, it would be more appropriate to use an ETF rather than individual stocks – for example: &lt;strong&gt;Turned around and couldn’t find anything suitable; gains were 20%-30%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the domestic market, long-term trends point towards a period of consolidation and decline, with potential for significant rallies in the short term. To make profits, it&amp;rsquo;s best to execute profit-taking operations within this timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;associated-term-definitions&#34;&gt;Associated Term Definitions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;black-swan&#34;&gt;Black Swan
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;Black Swan&amp;rdquo; originates from Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s book &lt;em&gt;The Black Swan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concept:&lt;/strong&gt; Refers to events that are &lt;strong&gt;extremely unlikely&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;unpredictable&lt;/strong&gt;, but upon occurring, they generate &lt;strong&gt;extreme impact and disruptive consequences&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rarity/Unpredictability:&lt;/strong&gt; These events have no precedent or warning signs before they occur, exceeding all conventional expectations and model predictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extreme Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Once they happen, they can cause catastrophic effects on markets, economies, and even societies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-hoc Rationalization:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite being impossible to predict beforehand, people tend to find reasons and explanations after the event occurs, making it appear “understandable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source Legend:&lt;/strong&gt; Before the discovery of Australia, Europeans believed all swans were white until black swans were discovered in Australia, completely overturning thousands of years of knowledge. Therefore, the Black Swan symbolizes &lt;strong&gt;unforeseen and cognitive breakthroughs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Market Examples:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;9/11&amp;rdquo; terrorist attack in 2001 (a short-term shock to global markets).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The initial impact of &lt;strong&gt;COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt; on the global economy and markets (although some argued it had grey rhino characteristics, its sudden outbreak and global spread, as well as the extent of its impact, were largely considered Black Swans).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gray-rhino&#34;&gt;Gray Rhino
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “Gray Rhino” was coined by Michele Wucker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concept:&lt;/strong&gt; Refers to a potential crisis that is &lt;strong&gt;highly probable&lt;/strong&gt;, has a &lt;strong&gt;significant impact&lt;/strong&gt;, and yet is &lt;strong&gt;ignored&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;selectively delayed in addressing&lt;/strong&gt; due to its &lt;strong&gt;obvious warning signs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Probability/Predictability:&lt;/strong&gt; The event has clear indicators and evidence before it occurs, making it a &lt;strong&gt;known&lt;/strong&gt; risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easily Ignored:&lt;/strong&gt; Because it’s not sudden but rather long-term or slowly developing, people become numb, exhibit optimism bias, or procrastinate, failing to take timely action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Once it erupts, due to the lack of effective responses beforehand, it triggers a chain reaction and causes severe destructive consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source Allusion:&lt;/strong&gt; A gray rhino is large in size and has a slow reaction time; people can see it from afar, but often fail to avoid it because of negligence or indifference. Once it charges towards you, it will cause a fatal collision. Therefore, the gray rhino symbolizes &lt;strong&gt;obvious yet ignored&lt;/strong&gt; major threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Market Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2008 &lt;strong&gt;Global Financial Crisis&lt;/strong&gt; (many experts had already warned about the high risk of the US subprime mortgage market, but were largely ignored).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sovereign Debt Crises&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;severe asset bubbles&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;systemic risks from climate change&lt;/strong&gt; (these are long-accumulated, traceable major risks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Delayed Muscle Soreness (DMS)</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/delayed-muscle-soreness-dms/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 11:53:20 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/delayed-muscle-soreness-dms/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on reducing fat and shaping my body, primarily through running at the gym to burn calories. I’m also supplementing this with some basic strength training to boost my basal metabolism. I’ve noticed a pattern: muscle soreness always lags behind, and not working out every day doesn’t cause as much pain; it&amp;rsquo;s really noticeable 48-72 hours after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My training goals are mainly to return to my ideal weight, so the intensity of strength training isn’t planned to be particularly high. Based on my experience hiking Mount Lu in September, this type of soreness usually takes about three days to fully resolve (when I was younger, I had some experiences with dieting and my physical condition was much better, recovery was much faster). Now that my leg muscles have adapted and recovered, but I feel like the main muscle groups throughout my body still need to be reactivated and adjusted one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;doms-delayed-onset-muscle-soreness&#34;&gt;DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You mentioned this phenomenon is referred to as &lt;strong&gt;Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness&lt;/strong&gt; (DOMS), often abbreviated as &lt;strong&gt;DOMS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its main characteristic is that the onset of pain has a delay, and it’s not typically at the most intense immediately after exercise or the next day, but rather peaks between &lt;strong&gt;24 to 72 hours post-exercise&lt;/strong&gt;, which aligns with your experience (noticeable reaction two days later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of the primary reasons why this occurs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microscopic Muscle Fiber Damage:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOMS is believed to be primarily caused by lactic acid buildup rather than lactic acid accumulation (lactic acid is cleared from muscles within an hour of exercise), but instead, it’s due to performing unfamiliar or high-intensity movements, particularly those involving a lot of &lt;strong&gt;eccentric contraction&lt;/strong&gt; (muscle lengthening during exertion – for example, the lowering phase of a squat or running downhill) that cause &lt;strong&gt;microscopic tears or damage in muscle fibers and connective tissue&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation Response:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These microscopic injuries trigger the body’s &lt;strong&gt;inflammatory response&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the process of the body repairing damaged tissue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;onset, development, and accumulation of this inflammatory response take time&lt;/strong&gt;. During this process, tissues release chemicals (such as histamine, prostaglandins, etc.) to stimulate nerve endings, causing pain and soreness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, the soreness doesn&amp;rsquo;t become most noticeable until the &lt;strong&gt;second or third day&lt;/strong&gt; after injury because it needs time for inflammation to fully develop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your muscle soreness is delayed because it’s a process of your body undergoing &lt;strong&gt;muscle microscopic damage&lt;/strong&gt; and an &lt;strong&gt;inflammatory response&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than immediate lactic acid buildup. If you are currently doing basic training that includes a lot of strength training and eccentric contraction movements, it&amp;rsquo;s more likely to cause this delayed soreness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-cope-with-and-address&#34;&gt;How to Cope with and Address
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rest and Recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Allow the affected muscles adequate rest time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gentle Activity:&lt;/strong&gt; Engage in light aerobic exercise or stretching, which can help improve blood circulation, accelerate metabolic waste removal, and promote recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massage or Foam Rolling:&lt;/strong&gt; Can relieve muscle tension and stiffness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adequate Nutrition:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s also important to replenish protein (to repair muscles) and carbohydrates (to replenish energy) promptly after exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progressive Increase in Intensity:&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid suddenly increasing exercise volume or intensity, allowing the body to gradually adapt to training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 19:09:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/all-the-gifts-of-ai-have-already-been-marked-up-with-prices-in-the-shadows/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The frequency of article releases has noticeably increased with the use of AI, and I intend to differentiate this in the tags within the text as well. The author’s column will also note the names of large models. However, the issue persists: articles generated by AI have significantly reduced my level of involvement, with many articles being forgotten after a month or so. This occurs similarly when writing code – instead of analyzing problems based on existing knowledge, I instinctively turn to AI for analysis and troubleshooting, leading to a clear increase in “laziness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative AI may boost work efficiency, but its &amp;ldquo;gift&amp;rdquo; comes at a huge cost. A research study at Peking University analyzed 410,000 papers and longitudinal experiments, finding that AI accelerates knowledge production but leads to severe homogenization; a Harvard study showed that AI causes “credential bias,” with junior positions decreasing by 7.7%, exacerbating the Matthew effect. On a personal level, the creativity boost brought about by AI is a fleeting &amp;ldquo;illusion&amp;rdquo; – it disappears when deactivated, but ideological homogenization persists, forming “creative scars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-situation&#34;&gt;Current Situation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is not only reshaping industries across the board but fundamentally altering how humans write, think, and reason. &lt;strong&gt;Following the release of ChatGPT3.5, an optimistic expectation spread widely: AI would bring about “work leveling.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, two MIT economics PhDs published empirical research on this claim in the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; journal, providing evidence to support it: that generative AI significantly boosts the performance of low-performing employees, potentially bridging the gap with high-performing ones and reducing inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; journal editors summarized this as, “Weaker participants benefited most from ChatGPT, a finding with important implications for policies aimed at reducing productivity inequalities through AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;two years later, reality seems to have not fully followed this ideal path.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, two Harvard economics PhDs, analyzing recruitment and employment data covering over 6.2 million employees and more than 1.5 billion instances between 2015 and 2025, revealed a stark truth: &lt;strong&gt;Generative AI is reshaping the labor market in a “credential-biased” way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data showed that between 2015 and 2022, the employment growth curves for junior and senior positions were roughly consistent, but starting in 2023, they began to diverge: Senior positions continued to rise, while junior positions started to decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For companies deeply embracing AI, the number of their junior-level positions decreased by approximately 7.7% over six quarters, while senior positions remained largely unaffected and even saw slight growth. This phenomenon was primarily due to a reduction in hiring rather than mass layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI has not brought about equitable leveling but has instead exacerbated the Matthew effect – “the rich get richer.”&lt;/strong&gt;  Cheng Travel CEO Liang Jianzhang commented on the paper: &amp;ldquo;AI will replace basic intellectual labor, exacerbating the difficulties faced by young people in education, marriage and early career stages.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural changes in the labor market are just the tip of the iceberg. &lt;strong&gt;A deeper question then arises: as AI is integrated into our workflows, what impact is it having on human creativity itself? Is the efficiency boost brought about by AI truly internalized individual capabilities? Is it shaping – or even “homogenizing” – our thoughts in ways we haven’t yet perceived? Once individuals become overly reliant on AI, is their independent, original thinking ability enhanced, or is it subtly being weakened?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Professor Li Guiquan&amp;rsquo;s research group at Peking University published a paper in the social science top journal &lt;em&gt;Technology in Society&lt;/em&gt;, addressing these key issues head-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the research comprised two parts. The first was a large-scale natural experiment that analyzed over 41,000 academic papers across all 21 disciplines before and after the release of ChatGPT3.5, dissecting AI’s true impact on global knowledge production. The second was a longitudinal behavioral experiment conducted over several months, exploring AI&amp;rsquo;s long-term causal effects on individual cognitive abilities in a laboratory setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining breakpoint regression design and machine learning techniques, the research team revealed generative AI’s long-term and genuine impacts on both individual creativity and group homogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This journal is JCR 1-star, with an impact factor of 12.5, ranking 271 out of 271 journals in the socialscience, Interdisciplinary category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;410000-papers-collective-unconscious&#34;&gt;410,000 Papers&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Collective Unconscious&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most terrifying thing isn’t the noise, but the chorus of voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;410000-papers-collective-unconscious-1&#34;&gt;410,000 Papers’ “Collective Unconscious”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was a large-scale natural experiment.
The research team extracted academic outputs spanning all 21 disciplines – physics, life sciences and biomedical sciences, applied sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities – from the authoritative Web of Science Core Collection database. Through random sampling of over 17,000 scholars, the team ultimately collected all 419,344 papers published before and after the release of ChatGPT-3.5, constructing a massive dataset to analyze the true impact of AI on global knowledge production.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/all-the-gifts-of-ai-have-already-been-marked-up-with-prices-in-the-shadows/20251010191749.png&#34;

&gt;
Illustration of homogeneity and creativity in academic papers before and after the release of Generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in the figure above, prior to 2022, global academic output (red/blue lines) exhibited steady growth alongside homogeneity (gray line). However, following the release of ChatGPT3.5, both curves experienced a sharp increase in slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, after GPT3.5’s release, academia not only accelerated knowledge production (creativity) at an unprecedented rate but also intensified the homogenization of its content at an even faster pace, clearly demonstrating the “double-edged sword” effect of generative AI on knowledge production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate that the observed changes were caused by AI and not due to chance, the research team employed a causal inference method called “Regression Discontinuity Design” (RDD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-do&#34;&gt;How to Do
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;They viewed the release of ChatGPT-3.5 in December 2022 as a natural “time breakpoint.” Whether a paper was published before or after that date posed numerous uncontrollable factors for individual scholars (such as review cycles), effectively creating a randomized “experimental group” (with the opportunity to use AI) and a “control group” (unable to use AI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-its-reliable&#34;&gt;Why it’s Reliable
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “pseudo-randomness” allows researchers to effectively isolate other long-term confounding factors and precisely identify the causal effects brought about by AI. To ensure the rigor of this method, the team also conducted a series of specialized statistical tests, confirming that scholars did not engage in strategic behaviors such as “delaying publication” or “early release” before or after the “breakpoint,” thereby guaranteeing the reliability of the research results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-quantify-creativity-and-homogeneity-metrics&#34;&gt;How to Quantify “Creativity” and “Homogeneity” Metrics?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the confirmation of causality, the research team conducted a quantitative analysis of these 40+ thousand papers across two dimensions: “creativity” and “homogeneity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity:&lt;/strong&gt; Evaluated based on the number of paper publications and the quality of those publications (JCR Quartiles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number: The total number of papers published by an author.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quality: The JCR Quartile score of the journal in which the paper was published. This is a prestigious journal ranking system, with Q1 representing the top 25% of journals in a field and Q4 representing the bottom 25%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homogeneity:&lt;/strong&gt; Evaluated through content similarity and language style similarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content Similarity: Utilizing an SBERT deep learning model to convert paper abstracts into numerical “vectors,” then calculating the “cosine similarity” between these vectors to determine the degree of similarity in their core meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language Style Similarity: Employing a character-level matching algorithm to scan and calculate repeated phrases and sentence structures between paper abstracts, thereby measuring the similarity of writing styles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-double-edged-sword-more-efficient-yet-more-monotonous&#34;&gt;A Double-Edged Sword: More Efficient, Yet More Monotonous
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As shown, the analysis results clearly reveal a “double-edged sword” effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, the emergence of AI has become a powerful “accelerator” for academic output: the average annual publication volume per scholar increased by 0.9 papers, and the quality of published journals averaged an increase of 6%. This effect is particularly prominent in fields such as technology and physical sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on the other hand, the gains in efficiency are coming at the cost of diversity in thought and expression. Data show that the average annual similarity of writing styles in papers increased surprisingly by 79%, while the thematic content of papers also showed a significant convergence, with the most serious phenomenon being homogenization in physics, arts, and humanities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/all-the-gifts-of-ai-have-already-been-marked-up-with-prices-in-the-shadows/20251010192022.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This large-scale natural experiment conducted by Peking University researchers provides us with real-world macro evidence: Generative AI is indeed a powerful “accelerator” for academic output, helping scholars to produce and publish faster in better journals. However, this increase in efficiency comes at the cost of diversity in thought and expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global knowledge production seems to be becoming more efficient and more “monotonous” in this “great exchange.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, research two also left a deeper question: what does this macro trend mean for individuals who are immersed in it? Does the creativity boost brought by AI represent genuine personal cognitive growth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, the research team conducted a longitudinal behavioral experiment tracking over several months in a controlled laboratory environment in research two to explore the long-term causal effects of AI on individual cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scars-of-creativity-left-by-ai&#34;&gt;Scars of Creativity Left by AI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once ideas submit to habit, they lose the possibility of creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ais-creative-scars&#34;&gt;AI&amp;rsquo;s Creative Scars
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there have already been numerous laboratories using small-sample empirical studies from different angles to confirm the trends revealed by macro data. For example, research at Cornell University found that AI writing assistants sacrifice cultural uniqueness and cause users’ expressions to tend towards “Western paradigms”; research at Santa Clara University also showed that individuals who used ChatGPT were more similar in their creativity semantically.
Notably, a research team from MIT directly observed the brains of individuals using electroencephalography (EEG) technology, finding that the brain activity level of the group of students who used ChatGPT was significantly lower than that of the group that relied solely on their own thinking or used search engines.
These studies point to one conclusion: AI is sacrificing cognitive input and diversity to enhance efficiency.
However, most research focuses on the immediate impact of using AI, with little exploration of whether the effects of AI “leaving the field” can be sustained and whether its long-term negative impacts will diminish.
This study by Peking University made a new attempt in this area.
It not only observed the immediate effect of AI in a seven-day experiment, but also systematically tested the long-term consequences of AI dependence through two independent tracking tests after the end of the experiment – on day 30 and day 60. This allowed us to truly see whether what AI brought was a transferable “ability” or a fleeting, uninternalizable “illusion.”
Specifically, the Peking University research team randomly divided 61 college students into two groups: “AI experimental group” (able to use ChatGPT-4) and “pure brainpower control group.”
The experiment design consisted of three key stages: first, all participants completed a creativity baseline test on day one without using AI; then, from days two to six, the “AI experimental group” completed daily creativity tasks with AI assistance, while the “pure brainpower control group” completed the tasks without assistance; finally, and most importantly, on day seven, day 30, and day 60, all participants had to complete the final tracking test without any AI assistance.

To comprehensively evaluate “creativity,” the study used a composite task mode covering multiple dimensions. These tasks included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divergent Thinking Test:&lt;/strong&gt; The classic “Alternative Uses Task” (AUT), requiring participants to come up with as many novel uses as possible for everyday items (such as “a pen”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative Problem Solving:&lt;/strong&gt; More realistic business scenario questions, such as asking participants to design innovative features for a “smart bicycle.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convergent Thinking Test:&lt;/strong&gt; The “Remote Association Test” (RAT) added during the tracking phase, requiring participants to find a word that can connect three unrelated words simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight Question:&lt;/strong&gt; The classic “Candle Problem,” requiring participants to fix a candle on the wall with a box of nails, a candle, and a box of matches, without letting the wax drip onto the table.
To ensure the scientificity of the assessment, the study used the “gold standard” in the field – expert consensus evaluation (CAT). Multiple expert judges independently scored thousands of creative outputs (including divergent thinking tasks and complex problem solutions) on multiple dimensions such as novelty, practicality, and flexibility in a “blind” condition where they were unaware of the grouping situation and research purpose. High data consistency (rating agreement ICCs &amp;gt; 0.90) ensured the scientific and fairness of the assessment results.
The homogeneity measurement method used in Study II adopted the same technical methods as Study I to ensure consistency between the two studies’ evaluation standards.
The experimental results clearly revealed a stark asymmetry:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity Enhancement is Transient and Unsustainable:&lt;/strong&gt; During the AI usage phase (days 2-6), the “AI experimental group”’s creativity indicators were indeed far beyond that of the “pure brainpower group.” However, once the AI was removed, this advantage instantly disappeared. Starting from day seven until day 60, there was no significant difference in creativity performance between the two groups. More alarmingly, in the 60-day convergent thinking test, the participants in the experimental group’s performance was even significantly worse than that of the control group who had never used AI, what AI brought was not a transferable “ability,” but rather an uninternalizable “illusion.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Homogenization of Thoughts is Long-lasting and Leaves &amp;ldquo;Creative Scars&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/strong&gt; In contrast to the fleeting creativity enhancement, the homogenization of thought demonstrated surprising “stickiness.” Even after two months of not using AI, the output content from the “AI experiment group” – regardless of whether it was measured in terms of semantics or language style – still exhibited significantly higher similarity compared to the control group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This longitudinal study provided direct causal evidence confirming the long-term impact of AI on individual creativity. The potential brought by AI may only be a “creative illusion” that cannot be internalized, while the resulting tendency towards homogenization of thought could become an enduring “creative scar,” persistently embedded in our cognitive and expressive habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;if-the-world-had-no-new-creativity&#34;&gt;If the world had no new creativity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the best of times, it is the worst of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;if-the-world-lacked-new-creativity&#34;&gt;If the World Lacked New Creativity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research from Tsinghua University, concluding that we shouldn’t abandon AI entirely just because of our own frustration, instead aims to remind us that we must consciously understand and address the long-term impact of prolonged reliance on AI on individual thinking and cognitive habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “homogenization” trend revealed in the study is rooted in profound principles of cognitive science: AI outputs easily trigger a powerful “anchoring effect” in users. When AI quickly generates an apparently “decent” answer or framework, our minds become anchored to this initial solution, making it difficult for subsequent thought and creativity to significantly deviate, ultimately leading to the convergence of ideas at the group level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July of this year, when Huang Renjun made a calm assessment during an interview with CNN: &amp;ldquo;If the world lacks new creativity, then the productivity gains brought about by AI will translate into unemployment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As generative AI is increasingly used, the internet’s information and human knowledge base are becoming more homogenized at an unprecedented speed. Tsinghua University&amp;rsquo;s research cold-heartedly confirms that this trend exists. If society can continuously generate new ideas, AI will create more diverse employment opportunities; if it only repeats old tasks, AI can complete them in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI amplifies creativity but also accelerates the expulsion of “those with dry ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-age-of-ai-how-to-maintain-sharp-thinking&#34;&gt;In the Age of AI, How to Maintain Sharp Thinking
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI alleviates our workload, but we need to establish a thinking system capable of deep thought, one that can interact with AI, articulate the problems we want AI to solve, and also engage in reasoning about those problems. Simultaneously, we must evaluate whether AI has answered correctly – we need dialectical thinking. —Huang Renfu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-age-of-ai-how-to-maintain-sharp-thinking-1&#34;&gt;In the Age of AI, How to Maintain Sharp Thinking
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As individuals navigating the age of AI, how should we position ourselves? How can we enjoy the convenience of AI while avoiding creative barrenness? Combining insights from research, here are some specific action recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat AI as a “Thinking Drill”:&lt;/strong&gt; Consider it an tireless companion that provides unlimited perspectives. Use it for brainstorming, generating multiple possibilities, and challenging your ingrained assumptions. However, the final filtering, deepening, decision-making, and accountability for the results must always be yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliberately Practice &amp;ldquo;Cognitive Friction&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/strong&gt; The most effective way to combat “anchoring bias” is to actively create “cognitive friction.” Don’t readily accept the AI&amp;rsquo;s first answer. Intentionally challenge it, find its logical flaws, and question aspects it hasn’t considered. This practice of critical thinking is key to maintaining our independent thinking abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish &amp;ldquo;AI-Free Time&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/strong&gt; Just as we need regular exercise to prevent muscle atrophy, we also need to regularly allow our brains to exercise without AI assistance. Regularly designate a weekly period of “AI-free time” for thinking, planning, and creating using the most basic tools – paper and pen or a blank document. This deliberate &amp;ldquo;cognitive detox&amp;rdquo; ensures that our core creative and reasoning abilities won’t deteriorate in comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>C&#43;&#43;23 introduces new features enumerate and ranges</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/c23-introduces-new-features-enumerate-and-ranges/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 19:08:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/c23-introduces-new-features-enumerate-and-ranges/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Optimizing performance for a hot function involves the bulk of the time spent within internal loops. AI suggested using &lt;code&gt;enumerate&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ranges&lt;/code&gt;, so I consulted some related documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main content of the article was generated by AI, and I tested the code and added some supplementary explanations. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wandbox.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Online Compiler&lt;/a&gt; – testing C++ code inevitably involves our old friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On gcc13, traditional for loops were slightly faster than &lt;code&gt;std::views::enumerate&lt;/code&gt;, which is negligible in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On gcc16, their performance was almost identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In debug mode, traditional for loops are noticeably faster—almost twice as fast as the new syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great question. &lt;code&gt;std::views::enumerate&lt;/code&gt; is part of the &lt;strong&gt;Ranges&lt;/strong&gt; library introduced in C++23, designed to provide a more concise and safer way to iterate over containers while simultaneously obtaining the element&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;index&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the design philosophy of C++, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::views::enumerate&lt;/code&gt; (along with most Ranges library Views) should perform at roughly the same level as traditional indexed loops or iterator loops in terms of performance&lt;/strong&gt;, and may even have a slight advantage in some compiler optimizations because it provides more advanced semantic information. Compilers are typically able to optimize &lt;code&gt;std::views::enumerate&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s high-level structure using the principle of &lt;strong&gt;Zero-Overhead Abstraction&lt;/strong&gt; by translating it into machine code that is equivalent to hand-written loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, we will detail the enumerate pattern and provide a complete C++ test demo to compare its performance with traditional patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stdviewsenumerate-pattern-explained&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::views::enumerate&lt;/code&gt; Pattern Explained
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::views::enumerate&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;view adaptor&lt;/strong&gt;, it takes a Range (e.g., &lt;code&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt;) and generates a new Range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Range&amp;rsquo;s Element Type:&lt;/strong&gt; Each element in the new Range is a &lt;strong&gt;structured binding&lt;/strong&gt; that can be unpacked as a &lt;strong&gt;tuple-like&lt;/strong&gt; object, containing two parts:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Index:&lt;/strong&gt; The element’s zero-based index (&lt;code&gt;std::size_t&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value/Reference:&lt;/strong&gt; A reference (typically &lt;code&gt;const auto&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;auto&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;) to the corresponding element in the original Range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage:&lt;/strong&gt; It is typically used together with C++17&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;structured bindings&lt;/strong&gt;, making code more concise and readable, similar to Python’s &lt;code&gt;enumerate()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Code Clarity:&lt;/strong&gt; Separates the index and element value within the loop header, making it immediately clear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Manual Index Management:&lt;/strong&gt; No need to declare an index variable outside the loop or forget to increment it inside the loop body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preserves Range-based For Loop Semantics:&lt;/strong&gt; Combines the conciseness of Range-based For Loops with the traditional For Loop’s requirement for indices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fully-executable-test-demo-c23&#34;&gt;Fully Executable Test Demo (C++23)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure a fair performance comparison, we use &lt;strong&gt;high-precision timing&lt;/strong&gt; to measure the time taken by both modes when processing large datasets.
&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Running this code requires a compiler that supports &lt;strong&gt;C++23&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;code&gt;std::views::enumerate&lt;/code&gt; is part of the C++23 standard).&lt;/p&gt;

## Fully Functional Test Demo (C++23)

## Performance Analysis and Conclusion

### Theoretical Analysis
In C++, the **fundamental reason for performance differences lies in whether the compiler can perform zero-overhead abstractions (Zero-Overhead Abstraction)**.

- **Traditional Loops:** Directly manipulating memory addresses and indices is the most fundamental and efficient approach.
- **`std::views::enumerate` Loop:** Introduces the `enumerate_view` abstraction layer. Internally, it implements pairing of index and value through iterators.
For modern, highly optimized compilers (such as GCC/Clang with O2/O3 optimizations), they will **inline** `enumerate_view` and its iterator operations, and perform techniques like **loop unrolling**. Ultimately, the assembly code generated by `std::views::enumerate` loop is **almost always identical to the assembly code generated by traditional indexed loops.**

### Actual Test Conclusions
Based on the results of actual running test demos (using O2/O3 optimization):

| **Traditional Index Loop** | X (Baseline) | ≈ 0% | Low: Requires manual index management, prone to errors |

### Practical Test Conclusions
| Pattern | Average Time (ms) | Performance Difference | Readability/Security |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`std::views::enumerate`** | X ± Minimal Variance | ≈ 0% | **High:** Automatic indexing, concise and safe |

### Practical Test Conclusions
**Conclusion:**
When using compiler optimizations, the **`std::views::enumerate` pattern is virtually indistinguishable from traditional indexing loop patterns in terms of performance; they can be considered equivalent.

Therefore, **in C++23 or later, it is recommended to use the `std::views::enumerate` pattern** as it significantly improves code **readability, conciseness, and safety** without sacrificing performance.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Productivity and Marketing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/productivity-and-marketing/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 19:15:06 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;“As I recall, Xiaomi was able to break through initially thanks to its solid product quality and distinctive cost-performance advantage – in those early years, other brands would often price similar models at four or five thousand yuan, while Xiaomi could keep the price under two thousand yuan. Many people were switching phones at that time, and they chose Xiaomi because of the ‘low-cost entry into high configuration.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-situation&#34;&gt;Current Situation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the past two or three generations of flagship phones, the upgrade momentum has noticeably weakened. Every time I look at new product parameters and features, it’s hard to have a “wow” moment – most are minor adjustments: such as camera algorithm optimization, slight battery life improvements, or simply changing the color scheme. There&amp;rsquo;s a lack of core changes that leave a lasting impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading the full text of Xiaomi 17’s launch event, this feeling is even more pronounced — this generation’s upgrades are still limited, whether it’s performance or features, they haven’t stepped out of the “minor repairs” category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actually, this isn&amp;rsquo;t just about Xiaomi; the entire digital technology industry now faces a similar situation: significant breakthroughs in hardware are becoming increasingly difficult to achieve, and the industry as a whole seems to be entering a slowdown. Unlike several years ago, when there were dazzling new developments every year – screen refresh rates increased, charging speeds doubled – it’s now much more difficult to achieve disruptive breakthroughs in hardware.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With many rational users dominating discussions on Zhihu (a Chinese Q&amp;amp;A platform), the related topics for Xiaomi 17&amp;rsquo;s launch are overwhelmingly critical, highlighting the small upgrade intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;marketing-prowess&#34;&gt;Marketing Prowess
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The runaway success of the Xiaomi SU7 unexpectedly reached a large number of previously overlooked female users, allowing Xiaomi to discover new user growth segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost simultaneously, the “Xiaomi 16 directly renamed to Xiaomi 17” event perfectly capitalized on this attention – not only did this break external stereotypes about Xiaomi phones, but it also leveraged “porting” to generate buzz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goodwill accumulated by the SU7’s users resonated with the public sentiment surrounding the rebranding: those interested in the SU7 would be curious about Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s phone products, and those who noticed the renaming would also be more inclined to learn about Xiaomi’s reputation thanks to the SU7’s positive word-of-mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this synergy allowed the Xiaomi 17 launch event to successfully break through to a significant number of non-traditional users who were previously unfamiliar with Xiaomi.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Memory timing C36, C30, and C28 – what do these mean? Which one is more suitable at a frequency of 6000MHz?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/memory-timing-c36-c30-and-c28-what-do-these-mean-which-one-is-more-suitable-at-a-frequency-of-6000mhz/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 21:48:19 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/memory-timing-c36-c30-and-c28-what-do-these-mean-which-one-is-more-suitable-at-a-frequency-of-6000mhz/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When assembling or upgrading a computer, we often see memory modules labeled with parameters like “DDR5-6000 CL36” and “DDR5-6000 CL30.” The “6000” represents the memory frequency (MHz), while “CL36” and “CL30” are abbreviations for “CAS Latency,” which is commonly referred to as “timings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;what’s the difference between C36, C30, and C28? How do they affect performance when frequencies are the same? And how should you choose?&lt;/strong&gt; Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss this topic in detail today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously written content about memory frequency: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/computer-assembly/&#34; &gt;电脑组装那些事&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-cas-latency-cl&#34;&gt;What is CAS Latency (CL)?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;strong&gt;CAS Latency (CL)&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the number of clock cycles a memory needs to wait between receiving a read command and actually starting to output data. The smaller this value, the faster the memory responds and the lower the latency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DDR5-6000 CL36: This indicates that the memory needs to wait 36 clock cycles to respond to a read request at a frequency of 6000MHz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DDR5-6000 CL30: At the same frequency, only 30 cycles are needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the frequencies are the same, a lower CL value results in smaller actual latency (Latency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-calculate-actual-latency&#34;&gt;How to Calculate Actual Latency?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people mistakenly believe that a higher frequency always equates to better performance, but in reality, &lt;strong&gt;actual latency = (CL ÷ Frequency) × 2000&lt;/strong&gt; (units: nanoseconds, ns). Let’s compare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| DDR5-6000 CL36 | 6000 | 36 | ((36 ÷ 6000) × 2000) ≈ &lt;strong&gt;12.0 ns&lt;/strong&gt; |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-calculate-actual-latency-1&#34;&gt;How to Calculate Actual Latency?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Model&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Frequency (MHz)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CL Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Actual Latency (ns)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DDR5-6000 CL30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;((30 / 6000) * 2000) ≈ &lt;strong&gt;10.0 ns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-calculate-actual-latency-2&#34;&gt;How to Calculate Actual Latency?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Model&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Frequency (MHz)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CL Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Actual Latency (ns)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;DDR5-6000 CL28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;((28 ÷ 6000) × 2000) ≈ &lt;strong&gt;9.33 ns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-is-actual-latency-calculated&#34;&gt;How is Actual Latency Calculated?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the actual latency of CL28 is approximately 22% lower than that of CL36. In latency-sensitive applications (such as gaming, high-frequency trading, real-time rendering, etc.), this difference may result in a perceptible performance improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-there-really-a-big-performance-difference&#34;&gt;Is There Really a Big Performance Difference?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In everyday scenarios like office work, web browsing, and video playback, the difference between CL36 and CL28 is almost imperceptible. However, the advantages of low-latency memory become more apparent in the following situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Frame Time Stability:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower latency helps reduce stuttering, especially in CPU-bound games (such as &lt;em&gt;CS2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Nioh&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Creation &amp;amp; Compilation:&lt;/strong&gt; Certain workflows that rely on memory bandwidth and latency (like large code compilation, 3D rendering caching) will also benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overclocking Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Low-latency memory typically uses better dies (such as Hynix A-die, M-die), which are more suitable for further overclocking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s important to note that &lt;strong&gt;low latency often means a higher price and stricter requirements for motherboard/BIOS compatibility.&lt;/strong&gt; If your motherboard doesn&amp;rsquo;t support EXPO/XMP 2.0 or your BIOS is older, you may not be able to stably run CL28 at high frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-which-one-should-i-choose-at-6000mhz&#34;&gt;So, which one should I choose at 6000MHz?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most users, especially those pairing it with &lt;strong&gt;AMD Ryzen 7000/8000 Series processors&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;DDR5-6000 CL30 is currently the “sweet spot” configuration&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The official JEDEC specification recommends a frequency of 6000MHz, and CL30 is the stable timing verified by AMD;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It offers high value for money, with moderate pricing and good compatibility;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actual latency is controlled around 10ns, balancing performance and stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re an &lt;strong&gt;extreme performance gamer&lt;/strong&gt; or seeking ultra-high frame rates, and your motherboard supports it well (such as high-end B650/X670 models), you can consider models with &lt;strong&gt;CL28 or even CL26&lt;/strong&gt;, but be prepared to potentially need manual tuning and voltage adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;strong&gt;CL36&lt;/strong&gt;, while it can be used, it’s typically entry-level DDR5 memory with high latency, &lt;strong&gt;unless your budget is extremely tight, we don&amp;rsquo;t recommend it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C36, C30, and C28 refer to the memory’s CAS Latency (Timings)&lt;/strong&gt;; lower numbers indicate smaller latency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the same frequency, CL28 is approximately 22% faster than CL36 in actual latency, offering greater performance advantages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DDR5-6000 CL30 is currently the most balanced choice&lt;/strong&gt; and suitable for most users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For extreme performance, choose CL28; if budget is limited, accept CL36, but weigh latency against price.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Desktop Boot Loader Failure</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/desktop-boot-loader-failure/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 21:25:37 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/desktop-boot-loader-failure/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In July, on a whim, with nothing better to do over the weekend, I decided to clean out the dust from my desktop PC – it hadn’t been cleaned in four or five years, and there was definitely quite a lot of dust accumulated. After cleaning it, I restarted the system, and everything worked perfectly fine. The computer wasn&amp;rsquo;t turned off regularly; it was left running constantly, with just the monitor switched off. Luckily, my wife came to stay, and she noticed various light sources at night, so she casually turned the computer off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heatsink&#34;&gt;Heatsink
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, I should have been writing articles all day, mixed with reinstalling systems and various things, I forgot about it. The human brain is sometimes so magical. Suddenly remembered today.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://example.com/weixin_pic_20250717180011_438_45.jpg&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Heatsink&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note:  I&amp;rsquo;ve replaced the placeholder image URL with a generic example. You should replace this with the actual URL of the image.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;boot-failure&#34;&gt;Boot Failure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every other day I’d attempt to boot the system, and it would crash with a blue screen, with the error messages changing several times until ultimately it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t boot at all. Thinking it might be a dust issue or that the hard drive installation wasn’t fixed properly, causing it to drop and lose the system boot files, leading to a boot failure. The error message clearly indicated a failed boot loading process. Fortunately, a USB drive could successfully enter the PE system, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t panic and proceeded with a series of operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replugging the hard drive cables – many drives, primarily the boot drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Escalating the situation by formatting the system partition and reinstalling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switching other disks as the hard drive and reinstalling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking the hard drive for any issues, using a disk detection tool to scan it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modifying the BOIS settings, trying various UEFI and compatibility modes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on these operations, attempting to convert the hard drive to MBR format, reconfiguring the bootloader, and installing the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent almost the entire weekend getting it up and running, and the system booted normally without any other issues. But why did I need to switch back to the old boot mode?
When I purchased the ASUS motherboard, it defaulted to UEFI mode. Over the many years in between, even after reinstalling the system, I always used UEFI mode. What was going on here that prevented it from working?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Breaking Through the Cocoon: Examining Huawei and Xiaomi’s High-End Rivalry Following Xiaomi 17&#39;s Renaming</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/breaking-through-the-cocoon-examining-huawei-and-xiaomis-high-end-rivalry-following-xiaomi-17s-renaming/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 10:15:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/breaking-through-the-cocoon-examining-huawei-and-xiaomis-high-end-rivalry-following-xiaomi-17s-renaming/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In an era of information explosion, we all, to varying degrees, live within our own “information bubbles.” Algorithms recommend content that interests us, and over time, our horizons are subtly narrowed. This phenomenon seems equally applicable to the smartphone market – brand loyalty, media bias, and community voices are all weaving consumers into one bubble after another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Xiaomi’s recent move, like a stone thrown into a still lake, has created ripples, attempting to break down this invisible barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Information bubbles, Xiaomi phone change 16 to 17 is not a temporary action, so much inventory, Huawei&amp;rsquo;s high-end path? Xiaomi’s high-end path ultimately relies on product strength to speak&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;xiaomis-concealed-strategy-skipping-16-confronting-17&#34;&gt;Xiaomi’s “Concealed Strategy”: Skipping 16, Confronting 17
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xiaomi has resolutely renamed its upcoming flagship, set to be released as the “Xiaomi 17,” from the initially planned “Xiaomi 16,” revealing its intent – a direct challenge to Apple’s iPhone 17. This was not a spontaneous whim; for a company of this scale, any flagship product&amp;rsquo;s naming, preparation, and marketing is a massive undertaking that requires careful planning months, or even years in advance, involving millions of packaging materials, promotional items, and channel communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This renaming represents Xiaomi’s meticulously planned “concealed strategy,” a bold gamble on a brand-level strategic move. It sends a clear signal: Xiaomi is no longer content with the “value for money” label; instead, it intends to enter Apple and Huawei’s long-dominated high-end market territory with a “head-on confrontation” attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By aligning itself digitally with the iPhone, Xiaomi aims to break consumers&amp;rsquo; ingrained thinking, placing its products in the same conversational context as top-tier flagships. This is Xiaomi’s bold and confident declaration of its product capabilities, and represents its most aggressive and decisive attempt to penetrate the high-end market after five years of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;huaweis-high-end-path-rebuilding-glory-in-adversity&#34;&gt;Huawei’s High-End Path: Rebuilding Glory in Adversity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the topic of the high-end market is mentioned, Huawei is unavoidable. After experiencing the widely known external pressures, Huawei&amp;rsquo;s path to the high-end has been exceptionally difficult yet remarkably steadfast. Leveraging continued deep cultivation in imaging technology and breakthroughs in self-developed chips, Huawei’s Pura and Mate series remain benchmark products in the high-end market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s strategy is more like a “cultivation of inner strength.” It builds powerful technological barriers to entry, such as the XMAGE imaging brand, Kunlun Glass, HarmonyOS operating system, to create core differentiators for its products. Even when facing enormous challenges with supply chains, Huawei continues to enhance product quality, fostering extremely high user loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Huawei’s market share in China&amp;rsquo;s high-end market is steadily recovering – a story of victory based on resilience and product power. Its high-end path is one achieved through technological innovation and brand resilience, step by step, overcoming adversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-battle-of-the-titans-is-ultimately-a-matter-of-product-power&#34;&gt;The Battle of the Titans is Ultimately a Matter of “Product Power”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s “One-Step Completion,” or Huawei’s “Steady and Solid,” their paths to the premium market differ, but ultimately, the landing point is always “product power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-end users are willing to pay a higher price not just for a brand logo, but also for comprehensive recognition of the technology, experience, design, and services behind the product. After the noise of marketing, what truly retains users is genuine experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s focus our attention on the products themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imaging Capability:&lt;/strong&gt; The Huawei Pura 70 Ultra continues to lead in the mobile photography field thanks to its unique retractable camera and powerful XMAGE imaging system. Meanwhile, Xiaomi 17 Series also features a camera system co-developed with Leica, along with new sensors and algorithms, aiming to challenge top industry standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; The Xiaomi 17 was the first to feature Qualcomm’s latest flagship Snapdragon chip, boasting natural advantages in performance release. Huawei, on the other hand, relies on iterative development of its self-designed chips, showcasing unique competitiveness in power consumption and system synergy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen &amp;amp; Design:&lt;/strong&gt; Both sides are putting in their best efforts regarding screen quality, material, and design language. Kunlun Glass’s robust durability, combined with Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s continued investment in display technology, have become distinctive labels for their respective products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecosystem Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; HarmonyOS’s distributed capabilities enable Huawei to create a seamless ecosystem experience, while Xiaomi’s HyperOS is also working hard to build its own intelligent closed-loop ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing strategies can break down consumers&amp;rsquo; “information silos,” allowing more people to see a brand’s ambition and transformation. But to truly let consumers “walk out of the house” willingly switching brands, it ultimately relies on solid product power to provide an irresistible choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xiaomi turned the digital “16” into “17,” which is not just a change in name but also a leap in its brand mentality and market strategy. Huawei, meanwhile, has rebuilt the foundation of its premium brand amidst storms. This battle between the two giants in China’s high-end smartphone market is only beginning its most exciting chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For consumers, this is undoubtedly good news. When all the giants lower their postures and refocus their attention on products themselves, we will ultimately see a more diverse and experience-driven era. And who can emerge victorious in this battle of the titans – time, and the fingertips of every user, will give the final answer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;technical-overview&#34;&gt;Technical Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;keepalived-introduction&#34;&gt;Keepalived Introduction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keepalived is a high availability solution based on the VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) protocol, primarily used to implement server failover and load balancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Features:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;: Complex high availability architectures can be achieved through configuration files alone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lightweight&lt;/strong&gt;: Low resource consumption and excellent performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Principle:&lt;/strong&gt;
Keepalived utilizes the VRRP protocol to share a virtual IP address across multiple servers. In normal operation, the master server holds the virtual IP and provides services; when the master server fails, the backup server automatically takes over the virtual IP, ensuring service continuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;haproxy-overview&#34;&gt;HAProxy Overview
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAProxy is a high-performance load balancer and reverse proxy server, widely used in high concurrency scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Features:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Balancing:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports various load balancing algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Checks:&lt;/strong&gt; Monitors backend server status in real-time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSL Termination:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports HTTPS traffic handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical Monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides detailed running state statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application Scenarios:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web service load balancing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database connection pooling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microservice gateways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API interface proxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

After the master node fails, the VIP does not switch to the backup node.
&lt;strong&gt;Troubleshooting Steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# Check Keepalived configuration

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that VRRP protocol communication is normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check network interface configuration.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Availability:&lt;/strong&gt; Achieved through VRRP protocol for automatic failover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Balancing:&lt;/strong&gt; Intelligently distributes requests to improve system performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Checks:&lt;/strong&gt; Real-time monitoring of service status, automatically removing faulty nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of Maintenance:&lt;/strong&gt; Simple configuration and convenient management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Effectiveness:&lt;/strong&gt; Utilizing open-source software to reduce operational costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deploying in a production environment, it’s also necessary to consider comprehensive aspects such as network security, monitoring and alerts, and backup/restore procedures to ensure stable and reliable operation of the system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>From Meituan’s Losses to Bond Mismatch</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-meituans-losses-to-bond-mismatch/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 19:19:10 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-meituans-losses-to-bond-mismatch/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the turbulent and unpredictable stock market, we often use faith and expectations as our compass, attempting to navigate through the fog and reach the shores of wealth. However, when our voyage deviates from the guidance of the compass, it’s easy to lose direction, even to run aground. This essay is about one such journey, beginning with an unwavering obsession with &lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/strong&gt;, which rose and fell repeatedly amidst the waves of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-clash-of-faith-and-reality-xiaomis-gains-and-losses&#34;&gt;The Clash of Faith and Reality: Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s Gains and Losses
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, I bought into Xiaomi with unwavering &lt;strong&gt;faith&lt;/strong&gt; in Lei Jun and a hopeful vision for the company’s electric vehicles. At the time, faith was a powerful force, temporarily blinding me to Lei Jun’s shrewdness as a capitalist and overlooking the risks posed by the High-Level Flash Lightning Distribution Platform. Fortunately, several &lt;strong&gt;wave trading&lt;/strong&gt; operations ended with modest profits, giving me a sweet taste of entering the Hong Kong stock market for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this self-confidence soon followed. After making a small profit on &lt;strong&gt;Jiu Fang&lt;/strong&gt; stocks, I became somewhat &lt;strong&gt;dazed&lt;/strong&gt;, relying solely on the flow of net buying funds from the &lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong Connect&lt;/strong&gt; indicator instead of rational analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;meituans-waterloo-and-blind-re-positioning&#34;&gt;Meituan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Waterloo&amp;rdquo; and Blind Re-positioning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guided by the flow of funds, I turned my attention to &lt;strong&gt;Meituan&lt;/strong&gt;. However, this time, I didn’t delve into the company’s &lt;strong&gt;financial data&lt;/strong&gt;, its &lt;strong&gt;historical trends&lt;/strong&gt;, or even realize the raging &lt;strong&gt;food delivery war&lt;/strong&gt; that was unfolding. When the stock price began to fall, I failed to cut my losses in time and instead blindly &lt;strong&gt;added to my position&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares trading at HK$20,000-30,000, limitations on capital prevented me from managing my positions freely, which undoubtedly exacerbated my losses in Meituan. This lesson deeply made me realize that in the Hong Kong stock market, blind re-positioning is like trying to fill a constantly leaking bathtub with more water – it only accelerates the loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stupid-people-are-lucky---an-unexpected-gain&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stupid People Are Lucky&amp;rdquo; - An Unexpected Gain
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was worrying about Meituan&amp;rsquo;s losses, an unexpected turn of events occurred – I bought &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba&lt;/strong&gt;. Although I didn’t hold onto it, I quickly sold it and used the profit to offset some of Meituan’s losses. This might be what’s meant by “stupid people are lucky,” allowing me to temporarily escape Meituan&amp;rsquo;s predicament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finance-more-important-fundamentals-than-investing&#34;&gt;Finance: More Important Fundamentals Than Investing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This experience also made me re-examine my &lt;strong&gt;financial management&lt;/strong&gt; approach, aside from the ups and downs of the stock market. At the time, I invested a sum intended for short-term emergency funds into &lt;strong&gt;Chinese bonds&lt;/strong&gt;. This money was meant to be used for payment within two months, but the short-term holding yield on the bonds wasn&amp;rsquo;t high, and it also posed liquidity issues. If I had instead chosen to deposit this money into a &lt;strong&gt;money fund&lt;/strong&gt;, I could have earned more stable returns and readily redeemed it, better meeting my funding needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/sometimes-you-need-to-learn-how-to-interrupt/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own life trajectory, so the concept of “being a good teacher” often seems superfluous in adult circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;worldview&#34;&gt;Worldview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our life’s journey begins with vastly different formative experiences, these experiences converging and flowing like rivers to ultimately shape our unique life paths. Each story, each choice, weaves together and merges within our minds, solidifying into our perception of the world – our &lt;strong&gt;worldview&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed as tragedy may be merely a story in a book to another person. What you disdain as a lifestyle may be precisely the ideal someone else desperately pursues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and respecting each other’s differences is the first step in comprehending this diverse world. Sometimes, &lt;strong&gt;remaining silent is also a form of understanding&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer to share my experiences and insights rather than engage in empty chatter. However, inevitably, you will encounter moments where observing the slow flow of water is a worthwhile strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investment-philosophy&#34;&gt;Investment Philosophy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My choice of &lt;strong&gt;fixed income plus&lt;/strong&gt; as the primary investment approach is driven by its emphasis on &lt;strong&gt;stable returns&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;low risk&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, I will allocate a significant portion of my asset allocation to this type of product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding stocks, I differentiate between short-term and long-term investments. In my view, &lt;strong&gt;short-term investing&lt;/strong&gt; carries a strong speculative nature, resembling more of a &lt;strong&gt;gambit&lt;/strong&gt;; while &lt;strong&gt;long-term investing&lt;/strong&gt; is genuine &lt;strong&gt;value investing&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s like founding your own company, from fundraising to IPO – you not only reap stock dividends but also gain a profound understanding of economic laws and foresight for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recognized since childhood that I have a &lt;strong&gt;gambling addiction&lt;/strong&gt;, however, studying allows me to rationally control my irrational desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of digital currencies is something I generally dislike from an investment perspective – I haven’t found any real value, but we need to understand its principles and risks. There have previously been articles discussing stablecoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-eggs&#34;&gt;Easter Eggs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WeChat can fold group chats, and &lt;strong&gt;your private conversations with friends can also be folded&lt;/strong&gt;, from a design perspective, all conversations belong to the same level and are only differentiated in display.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Unexpected Software Uninstall Journey</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/a-unexpected-software-uninstall-journey/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 17:55:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/a-unexpected-software-uninstall-journey/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After reinstalling my system, I’ve consistently been missing a decent PDF reader. Within the 360 Software Center, I saw &lt;strong&gt;Xundu PDF&lt;/strong&gt; recommended, even with a “special edition.” I had already formed a slight impression of this brand at that point, wondering how a niche software like a PDF reader could possibly generate profits – surely the promotional costs wouldn’t pay off. Later, I encountered it again through Xunlei’s promotion, and my computer did indeed need one, so I conveniently installed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;everything-was-fine-until-the-weekend&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything was fine&amp;hellip; until the weekend&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After installing the software, it worked perfectly without issue. I noticed some AI features within it, but they required a paid subscription – which wasn’t useful for me, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t purchase them. Back then, I naively thought, “How much money could those paid features really earn?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until this weekend, when &lt;strong&gt;QQmusic&lt;/strong&gt; suddenly and inexplicably froze and crashed while I was developing locally. Instinctively, I opened Task Manager to see if there were any lingering processes. I discovered that the QQmusic process was still running but unresponsive, so after forcibly ending it, QQmusic could start up normally again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I inadvertently discovered a process named &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;PDF Engine&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;rdquo; which was consuming nearly 10% of CPU usage – while the entire system’s resource utilization was only 19%. Curious, I checked the file path and found that it was actually my previously installed &lt;strong&gt;Xoon PDF!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;loss-of-trust&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of Trust&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is a defect in the software, but I’ve completely lost trust in it at this point.
Considering its widespread promotion, I can’t help but wonder where all those high promotional costs are coming from – they must be earned somehow. The clandestine running of strange tasks in the background seems almost “reasonable” in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ByteDance AI’s SOLO encoding new paradigm</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bytedance-ais-solo-encoding-new-paradigm/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 21:49:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bytedance-ais-solo-encoding-new-paradigm/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously used products, during code development, were largely satisfactory, but Byte’s SOLO introduced significant differences. Initially, participation in beta testing was through invitation codes, and now it involves submitting an email address for review. After approval, the product can be used. I’ve forgotten when I submitted the application, but today I received a notification from Trae indicating that my application had been approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bytesolos-advantages&#34;&gt;ByteSolo’s Advantages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a standard project development process, it incorporates UI design, requirements analysis, functional design, technical solution implementation, and finally code development. In other words, the overall interaction logic is more friendly for beginners. For complex projects, the traditional approach remains more effective – AI as an auxiliary tool to modify and optimize existing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hong-kong--us-stocks-app-development&#34;&gt;Hong Kong &amp;amp; US Stocks App Development
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s right, the title is exactly what I wrote in the prompt statement, with no additional descriptions. In SOLO mode, first a requirements document and a technical architecture document were outputted. If the user confirms they are okay with it, code development will proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/ai-coding-trae-solo/blob/master/.trae/documents/%E6%B8%AF%E7%BE%8E%E8%82%A1APP%E4%BA%A7%E5%93%81%E9%9C%80%E6%B1%82%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Requirements Document&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/ai-coding-trae-solo/blob/master/.trae/documents/%E6%B8%AF%E7%BE%8E%E8%82%A1APP%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E6%9E%B6%E6%9E%84%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3.md&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Technical Architecture Document&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, while the design isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly perfect, it can be used as a draft.  Due to my lack of UI design experience and not having tested the functionality of importing Figma design drafts, it’s perfectly acceptable as a first draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the code construction process, some documents were also discovered. In SOLO mode, the AI attempts to handle any existing issues on its own, such as needing to increase the field design in my local database, it first generates the corresponding script and then writes a js script to execute the database script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also some highlights that I didn&amp;rsquo;t find while researching materials. The task decomposition feature was taken from a previous comic reading project. Byte is not short of money; one request can execute a lot of tasks, but this scenario doesn’t occur frequently, new projects will consume a large number of tokens. It’s only when users develop dependencies that they become profitable here.

        <title>Understanding spin-offs and splits in the US stock market can be challenging.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-spin-offs-and-splits-in-the-us-stock-market-can-be-challenging/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 22:09:31 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-spin-offs-and-splits-in-the-us-stock-market-can-be-challenging/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Prompt: As a Chinese person, when seeing English financial news and information about actions of US listed companies, why are mergers and acquisitions written like this: NAOV reverse stock split: 1 for 10? Is this a unique English grammar that doesn&amp;rsquo;t conform to Chinese grammatical habits? Based on this, please explain the meaning of the stock split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello! This is a very good question, and many investors who speak Chinese as their mother tongue will have the same confusion when first encountering English financial news. This is indeed a specific expression habit in English in the field of finance, which differs greatly from the order of Chinese grammar.
I will explain the meaning of the stock split to you in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-a-1-for-10-reverse-stock-split-written-as-1-for-10&#34;&gt;Why is a 1 for 10 Reverse Stock Split Written as “1 for 10”?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down this expression: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;A for B&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within this structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; represents the &lt;strong&gt;new thing you will receive&lt;/strong&gt; (the result).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; represents the &lt;strong&gt;old thing you are giving up&lt;/strong&gt; (the cost/exchange).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The word “for” here means &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;in exchange for&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;“1 for 10 reverse stock split”&lt;/strong&gt; translates directly as: &lt;strong&gt;“1 new share for 10 old shares”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, your &lt;strong&gt;every 10 existing shares will be consolidated into 1 new share&lt;/strong&gt;. This is precisely what the Chinese terms “10 combine with 1” or “10 shares merge into 1 share” mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;grammatical-habit-comparison&#34;&gt;Grammatical Habit Comparison
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English Convention (Result for Reason/Cost):&lt;/strong&gt;  Places “the result obtained” at the front and “the cost paid” at the back. For example, &lt;code&gt;You get 1 new share for your 10 old shares.&lt;/code&gt; Headlines are often shortened to &lt;code&gt;1 for 10&lt;/code&gt; for brevity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Convention (Reason/Cost -&amp;gt; Result):&lt;/strong&gt; Tends to follow a chronological or logical order, stating “the original state” first, followed by “the resulting outcome.” For example, “(originally) 10 shares merged into (now) 1 share.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this isn’t a universal English grammar; it&amp;rsquo;s a very common convention and abbreviation used when expressing &amp;ldquo;exchange ratio&amp;rdquo; in business and finance.
&lt;strong&gt;Illustrative Example (NAOV 1 for 10 Reverse Stock Split):&lt;/strong&gt;
Assume you hold 1000 shares of the NAOV company before a reverse stock split, with a share price of $0.5 per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Asset Value:&lt;/strong&gt; 1000 shares * $0.5/share = $500 USD
After the reverse split (1 for 10):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Shares Held:&lt;/strong&gt; 1000 shares / 10 = 100 shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theoretical Share Price:&lt;/strong&gt; $0.5/share * 10 = $5 per share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Asset Value:&lt;/strong&gt; 100 shares * $5/share = $500 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; The primary purpose of the reverse stock split is to increase the price per share, which reduces the number of shares you hold, but (assuming no market fluctuations) your total asset value remains unchanged. Companies typically conduct reverse stock splits to meet exchange minimum price requirements (such as Nasdaq’s requirement for a share price to maintain above $1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-split-explanation&#34;&gt;Stock Split Explanation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you understand consolidation, a stock split is easily understood. A stock split is the opposite of consolidation.
English is typically written like this: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;2 for 1 stock split&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;3 for 1 stock split&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
Using the &lt;code&gt;A for B&lt;/code&gt; structure we’ve learned above to interpret it:
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;2 for 1 stock split&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; means: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;You will receive 2 new shares in exchange for your 1 old share.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;
This is exactly what the Chinese phrase “&lt;strong&gt;1拆2&lt;/strong&gt;” or “&lt;strong&gt;1股拆为2股&lt;/strong&gt;” means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example (A Company’s 2 for 1 Stock Split):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that before the split, you hold 100 shares of a company with a stock price of $200 per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Asset Value:&lt;/strong&gt; 100 shares * $200/share = $20,000
After the split (2 for 1):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Shares Held:&lt;/strong&gt; 100 shares * 2 = 200 shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price Per Share (Theoretically)&lt;/strong&gt;: $200/share / 2 = $100 per share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Asset Value:&lt;/strong&gt; 200 shares * $100/share = $20,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; The purpose of a stock split is to lower the price per share, making it more attractive to small investors and increasing liquidity. It will increase your number of shares held, but equally so, your total asset value remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hong Kong Stock Exchange Brokerage Fee Liberalization and Market Competition</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-stock-exchange-brokerage-fee-liberalization-and-market-competition/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 21:47:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-stock-exchange-brokerage-fee-liberalization-and-market-competition/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The practice of “the same contract code, for transactions in the same direction, commission is only charged once” is commonly referred to as &lt;strong&gt;“Commission Aggregation / Combined Commission”&lt;/strong&gt; within the securities industry. This is not a hard-and-fast regulation by the Hong Kong Exchange or regulatory bodies, but rather a business convention formed through market competition and brokers’ efforts to optimize customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding HK stocks, when the same contract code is used for transactions in the same direction, only one commission is charged – does this have any historical business background?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-historical-turning-points-cancellation-of-the-minimum-commission-rule-in-2003&#34;&gt;Key Historical Turning Points: Cancellation of the Minimum Commission Rule in 2003
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the most important background to understand this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-Reform (Before April 1, 2003):&lt;/strong&gt; The Hong Kong stock market operated under a &lt;strong&gt;Minimum Commission Rule&lt;/strong&gt;. At the time, brokers were required to charge clients a commission of no less than 0.25% of the transaction value. During this period, all brokerage commissions were essentially locked at the same level, and competition primarily focused on research capabilities, client relationships, and service quality; price wars were virtually non-existent. Therefore, there was no incentive to consolidate commissions for clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Reform (After April 1, 2003):&lt;/strong&gt; The Hong Kong Exchange officially &lt;strong&gt;abolished the Minimum Commission Rule&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing brokers and clients to freely negotiate commission rates. This reform instantly ignited competition in the Hong Kong securities industry, particularly commission price wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-product-of-fierce-market-competition&#34;&gt;A Product of Fierce Market Competition
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the removal of minimum commission fees, securities firms (particularly emerging internet brokers) have adopted various innovative pricing strategies to attract customers. “Consolidated Commission” is one such highly attractive initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attracting Active Traders:&lt;/strong&gt; For high-frequency traders or investors who prefer to buy and sell the same stock in batches (such as to avoid large single orders impacting market prices), per-trade fees can significantly increase transaction costs. The “Consolidated Commission” policy perfectly addresses this pain point, allowing investors to flexibly establish or liquidate positions within a day without worrying about multiple commission charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing Customer Transaction Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the most direct objective. By consolidating calculations, customer actual commission expenses are reduced, making the broker’s platform more competitive in terms of cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing Customer Experience and Loyalty:&lt;/strong&gt; This customer-friendly policy greatly enhances the user experience, making customers feel that the broker is looking out for their interests, thereby strengthening customer loyalty and retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;business-logic-and-brokerage-interests&#34;&gt;Business Logic and Brokerage Interests
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although superficially, brokerage revenue appears to be declining, from a holistic business logic perspective, it’s a win-win situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Margin, High Volume:&lt;/strong&gt; Reducing the effective cost of each transaction can stimulate customers to trade more frequently, thereby increasing overall trading volume. While brokers “give away” commissions on individual trades, they can compensate by increasing total transaction volume and earning other fees, such as platform usage fees and financing/margin interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Share Acquisition:&lt;/strong&gt; In a fiercely competitive market, particularly for new internet brokerages, low commission rates and promotional policies are the most effective means of quickly acquiring users and capturing market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-points-to-note&#34;&gt;Key Points to Note
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not All Brokers Offer It:&lt;/strong&gt; While “merged commission” has become mainstream, it’s still a broker&amp;rsquo;s business decision and not a mandatory regulation. Some traditional brokers or banks may still charge per trade for their securities services, so investors need to carefully review the broker’s fee schedule when choosing a broker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only Applies to “Commission”:&lt;/strong&gt; Be sure to note that the calculated merged amount only includes the “commission” charged by the broker. Any “fixed fees” collected by the government or exchanges are calculated per trade and cannot be merged. These include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stamp Duty (印花税):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.1% (Paid by both buyer and seller, rounded up to the nearest dollar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SFC Transaction Levy (交易征费):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.0027% (Collected by the Securities and Futures Commission)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HKEX Trading Fee (交易费):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.00565% (Collected by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRC Transaction Levy (会财局交易征费):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.00015% (Collected by the Financial Regulatory Authority)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary, the “merged commission” policy of Hong Kong brokers is rooted in the abolition of the Minimum Commission System in 2003. It was a significant business strategy adopted by brokers in an environment of market liberalization and intense competition – to reduce customer costs, enhance service experience, attract and retain customers – representing a microcosm of Hong Kong’s financial market transitioning from traditional to modern, from high barriers to accessibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 18:57:38 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/daily-musings/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using AI too much, we start thinking of AI for everything – often, learning new developments is more reliable with search engines plus official project documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong stocks entered on the dip, encountered a pullback, and then just randomly traded, resulting in basic losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strategy-trading&#34;&gt;Strategy Trading
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily to actually practice and make money, but rather to improve my own abilities through learning. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in these trading indicators; I mostly trust the national fortune (luck) and investing in broad market indices via a buy-and-hold strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;algorithmic-trading&#34;&gt;Algorithmic Trading
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inspiration from last month’s “AI-less project” didn&amp;rsquo;t prove useful, so I started trying to implement it with AI – and that’s where the problems began. The correct approach should have been to first gather information and see what existing projects were doing. Previously, I hadn’t done any algorithmic trading; I wasn’t familiar with indicators, market data handling, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial plan was unreliable, entirely based on my own speculation (“YY”) through communication with AI. I learned about the backtesting framework this way, and looked at GitHub – the project was quite active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over-reliance on AI led to wanting to use it for everything, even requesting an AI-generated learning resource, a vibrant project, and official documentation that’s well-maintained. Prioritizing official documentation or searching for high-quality blogs is better; the learning plans provided by AI were too weak and didn&amp;rsquo;t keep up with current code versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Structure Adjustments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Download:&lt;/strong&gt; I chose Yahoo Finance – this provides daily candlestick data for price changes (price fluctuations).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backtesting Official Guide:&lt;/strong&gt; Learning the basics of using the official backtesting guide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TA-Lib Installation and Usage:&lt;/strong&gt; Installing and using TA-Lib, calculating common indicators, and displaying the data through backtesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing Alipay’s Fixed Investment Logic:&lt;/strong&gt; This strategy is better suited for long-term ETF investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hong-kong-stock-trading&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Stock Trading
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entering Hong Kong stock trading was roughly two months ago, a simple recap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing and motivation for buying Meituan were straightforward – I saw the net inflow of domestic funds and didn’t delve deeply into Meituan&amp;rsquo;s recent situation; coincidentally, I caught the food delivery war and became a shareholder in Meituan. Buying Xiaomi was also at a high price point, and it was appropriate to reduce my position and exit some shares when an opportunity arose. The four factories were implemented, presenting an opportunity, but one that required persistence – about three years have passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of entry was when Hong Kong’s new consumer and technology stocks were already expensive, coupled with the concept of virtual currencies; when technology stocks retraced, it was a recurring issue – the frequency of adding to positions is not suitable for long-term investment. Today, I thought about betting on a rebound, buying a hand full, but the next day it fell and I couldn’t bear to sell it. When encountering sustained declines, one easily gets trapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a long-term investor, my trading frequency was too high – roughly twice a week would be sufficient.
The Shanghai Composite Index is 3600; domestic large-cap stocks haven&amp;rsquo;t been much invested in through fixed deposits; this missed an opportunity as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>- Significant differences in trading and settlement between stocks and digital currencies</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/significant-differences-in-trading-and-settlement-between-stocks-and-digital-currencies/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 18:28:54 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/significant-differences-in-trading-and-settlement-between-stocks-and-digital-currencies/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the significant differences between traditional stocks and digital currencies in terms of trading and settlement, we need to deeply grasp the core “components” and “rules” that make up each ecosystem. We can view them as two entirely different games: one a rigorous, multi-party collaborative “professional league,” and the other a code-as-law, open-to-all “open world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the previous two questions, are there any foundational knowledge points we could explore to further expand this understanding? Let’s also compile some resources for you to learn more about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-1-the-foundation-of-traditional-stock-markets--a-chain-of-trust-composed-of-professional-institutions&#34;&gt;Part 1: The Foundation of Traditional Stock Markets – A Chain of Trust Composed of Professional Institutions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of traditional financial markets is &lt;strong&gt;“trust”&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;“intermediaries.”&lt;/strong&gt; The entire system is designed as a multi-layered structure, with each stage played by regulated professional institutions to ensure market stability and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-players&#34;&gt;The Players
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You (Investor):&lt;/strong&gt; The starting and ending point of the transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broker:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;sole gateway&lt;/strong&gt; for you to enter the market. You cannot directly go to the Shanghai Stock Exchange or New York Stock Exchange to buy stocks; you must use a broker holding a license to execute your trading instructions and hold your funds and securities (as a nominal holder).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Exchange:&lt;/strong&gt; The market’s &lt;strong&gt;“trading floor”&lt;/strong&gt;. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ. Its primary function is to provide a fair, open venue where buy and sell offers meet (matching), thereby discovering prices. &lt;strong&gt;The exchange only handles order matching; it does not handle subsequent fund and stock transfers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central Counterparty Clearing Corporation (CCP):&lt;/strong&gt; The market’s &lt;strong&gt;“risk guarantor”&lt;/strong&gt;. This is at the core of risk management. After a trade is executed, the CCP intervenes between all buyers and sellers, becoming “all buyers to all sellers” and “all sellers to all buyers.”  This way, any party&amp;rsquo;s default risk is borne by the CCP, preventing risks from spreading through the market like dominoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central Securities Depository (CSD):&lt;/strong&gt; The market’s &lt;strong&gt;“ultimate vault” and “master registry”&lt;/strong&gt;. Examples include DTCC in the US and China’s ZSDEC. This is a crucial institution that electronically centralizes and custodians the vast majority of securities in the entire market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;core-concepts-the-paperless-and-non-moveable-nature-of-securities&#34;&gt;Core Concepts: The “Paperless” and “Non-Moveable” Nature of Securities
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dematerialization:&lt;/strong&gt; The stocks you buy today are not physical paper certificates, but a series of electronic records within a CSD (Central Securities Depository) database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immobilization:&lt;/strong&gt; This is key to understanding settlement. When settlement occurs, there isn&amp;rsquo;t actually an “electronic stock file” being sent from one broker’s server to another. Instead, all the stocks are “fixed” stored in this central vault – the CSD. The settlement process simply involves the CSD making a transfer of shares from the seller broker’s omnibus account to the buyer broker’s omnibus account on its master ledger. Your broker then updates its own internal customer records to reflect that you now hold more shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multi-tiered, clearly defined structure, while introducing time delays (T+N), has established a robust and mature risk isolation and management mechanism – the cornerstone of modern financial markets&amp;rsquo; stable operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-two-the-foundation-of-the-digital-currency-market--a-trustless-system-built-on-code-and-cryptography&#34;&gt;Part Two: The Foundation of the Digital Currency Market – A “Trustless” System Built on Code and Cryptography
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital currencies aim to reduce or eliminate reliance on traditional intermediaries, with its foundation being &lt;strong&gt;“cryptographic proof”&lt;/strong&gt; rather than &lt;strong&gt;“institutional trust.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;core-technology-the-technology&#34;&gt;Core Technology (The Technology)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blockchain / DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology):&lt;/strong&gt; Think of it as a &lt;strong&gt;distributed, globally maintained ledger that cannot be altered, held by countless individuals.&lt;/strong&gt; Every transaction is publicly recorded and verifiable by anyone, but no single person or institution can control it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public &amp;amp; Private Keys:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the &lt;strong&gt;sole proof of ownership for your assets in the digital currency world.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Key:&lt;/strong&gt; Equivalent to your &lt;strong&gt;bank account number&lt;/strong&gt;. You can safely share this with anyone to receive digital currencies. Your wallet address is generated from the public key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Key:&lt;/strong&gt; Equivalent to your &lt;strong&gt;bank password + U盾 + signature combination&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s the only key to access assets associated with that address. &lt;strong&gt;Whoever holds the private key has absolute control over the assets in that address.&lt;/strong&gt; This is also the origin of the encryption world&amp;rsquo;s golden rule: “Not your keys, not your coins” (If you don’t hold the private key, you don’t own the cryptocurrency).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crypto Wallet:&lt;/strong&gt; It &lt;strong&gt;doesn’t store any “coins”&lt;/strong&gt; (coins always reside on the blockchain). The wallet’s essence is a &lt;strong&gt;tool for managing your private key&lt;/strong&gt; and helping you sign transactions with your private key to interact with the blockchain network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Contract:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a piece of code that automatically executes on the blockchain. Its logic is “If…then…” (IF-THEN). For example, a decentralized exchange’s smart contract could be: “If I receive 1 ETH from User A, then automatically send 2000 USDC to User A&amp;rsquo;s address.” The entire process is automatically enforced by code with no human intervention and without requiring trust in anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;core-rules-consensus-mechanism&#34;&gt;Core Rules: Consensus Mechanism
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do thousands of nodes in a network reach agreement on which transactions are valid when there is no central server? That’s the role of a consensus mechanism. The two most common types are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof of Work (PoW):&lt;/strong&gt; As exemplified by Bitcoin. It involves “miners” performing massive hash calculations (like solving an extremely difficult math problem) to compete for the right to record transactions. The first miner to solve the puzzle can package the latest transactions into a block and broadcast it to the entire network, which other nodes verify and accept. This method is highly energy-intensive but provides very high security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof of Stake (PoS):&lt;/strong&gt; Adopted by Ethereum after its upgrade. It no longer relies on a competition of computing power; instead, “validators” who hold and “stake” tokens are selected to create and validate blocks. The more tokens staked, the greater the probability of being chosen to record transactions. If they act maliciously, their staked tokens will be forfeited. This method is more energy-efficient and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-and-comparison&#34;&gt;Summary and Comparison
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand, we can use a table to summarize the fundamental differences between them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| &lt;strong&gt;Asset Type&lt;/strong&gt; | Electronic Ledger (Dematerialized) in CSD | Native Digital Token on Blockchain |&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;The other party in the trade or smart contract&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-and-comparison-6&#34;&gt;Summary and Comparison
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the above additions, you can see that traditional finance relies on establishing a complex “trust chain” to manage risk and complete settlements; while digital currencies attempt to build a system without intermediaries using technological means (cryptography and distributed networks) to achieve self-validation. These two fundamentally different underlying logics determine the stark differences in all aspects of transactions, clearing, and settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why the concept of “settlement” is necessary in traditional stock trading?</title>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/why-the-concept-of-settlement-is-necessary-in-traditional-stock-trading/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s era of the global digital wave, we&amp;rsquo;ve become accustomed to instant transfers and near-instant payments. Therefore, many people are confused: why, after clicking “sell” on a stock, does my funds not immediately clear in full and become available, but instead takes one or two business days? This is precisely a crucial and historically significant concept within traditional stock trading – &lt;strong&gt;settlement&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prompt: Why does traditional stock trading require the concept of settlement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trading” and “Settlement” are two separate steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading:&lt;/strong&gt; This refers to the moment you place a buy or sell order on an exchange that is successfully matched. At this point, you and your counterparty have reached a legally binding contract committing to exchanging stocks and funds at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settlement:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the process of fulfilling the terms of the agreed-upon contract – namely, the ownership of the stock officially and irrevocably transfers from seller to buyer, while the funds are officially and irrevocably transferred from the buyer’s account to the seller’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for these two separate steps and a time lag (such as T+1, T+2 systems) stems from historical evolution and rigorous risk management in finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-roots-originating-in-the-paper-era&#34;&gt;Historical Roots: Originating in the “Paper” Era
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the widespread adoption of computer systems, stocks were tangible &lt;strong&gt;paper certificates&lt;/strong&gt;. Following a trade executed orally or through gestures at an exchange, subsequent work was incredibly laborious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical Transportation:&lt;/strong&gt; The seller’s brokerage firm needed to retrieve the corresponding stock certificate from its vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endorsement Transfer:&lt;/strong&gt; Signing and endorsing the back of the certificate to verify ownership transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Delivery:&lt;/strong&gt; These certificates and associated checks had to be delivered by personnel (couriers) throughout the city to the buyer&amp;rsquo;s brokerage firm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification &amp;amp; Reconciliation:&lt;/strong&gt; The buyer’s brokerage firm needed to verify the authenticity of the certificates and the accuracy of the transaction details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire process involved a significant amount of manual labor and physical transfer, riddled with delays and uncertainty. Consequently, an settlement cycle of several days (initially as long as T+5) was established to complete these complex processes. In the late 1960s, Wall Street was plunged into a “Paperwork Crisis” due to a surge in trading volume; a large number of trades could not be completed on time, even forcing exchanges to shorten trading hours. This directly spurred the establishment of modern electronic clearing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-core-an-unreplaceable-risk-management&#34;&gt;Modern Core: An Unreplaceable Risk Management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all transactions being electronic today, the T+N settlement system remains in place because its core function has evolved from “waiting for logistics” to &lt;strong&gt;managing the massive risks of the financial system&lt;/strong&gt;. This process is primarily carried out by a key player – &lt;strong&gt;Central Counterparty (CCP) Clearinghouses&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the Depository Trust &amp;amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation (CSDC) in the United States and China, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement system is mainly designed to mitigate the following core risks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;counterparty-risk&#34;&gt;Counterparty Risk
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the most fundamental risk. If you sell shares, how can you be 100% certain that the buyer will pay on time? Conversely, how can the buyer be 100% certain that the seller will deliver genuine shares? If either party defaults, it could trigger a chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; The intervention of a Central Counterparty (CCP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a trade occurs, the CCP steps in between the buyer and seller, &lt;strong&gt;acting as both the seller’s “buyer” and the buyer’s “seller.”&lt;/strong&gt; Through this legal arrangement called “novation,” the original buyer-seller relationship is no longer direct; instead, each party is responsible to the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Seller:&lt;/strong&gt; As long as shares are delivered to the CCP, they will definitely receive money from the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Buyer:&lt;/strong&gt; As long as money is delivered to the CCP, they will definitely receive shares from the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, the default risk of a single participant is absorbed by the highly creditworthy central institution – the CCP – and does not spread throughout the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;clearing--netting&#34;&gt;Clearing &amp;amp; Netting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large brokerage firm handles millions of transactions in a single day, involving both buying and selling. If each transaction were processed individually, the system would be overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; “Clearing” is performed before settlement date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the trading day (T-day), clearing agencies consolidate all buy and sell transactions for each broker, known as &lt;strong&gt;“netting” or “clearing &amp;amp; netting.”&lt;/strong&gt; For example, a brokerage firm might have bought $10 billion worth of stock and sold $9.8 billion on a given day. On settlement day, it only needs to pay a net difference of $20 million in cash, rather than engaging in a $19.8 billion exchange. Similarly, securities settlements are also processed on a net basis. This significantly improves the efficiency of the entire market and reduces liquidity requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-complete-lifecycle-of-a-stock-transaction&#34;&gt;The Complete Lifecycle of a Stock Transaction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a simple example to see the entire process from trade to settlement (using a T+2 model):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T Day (Trading Day):&lt;/strong&gt; You click “Buy” 100 shares of a company&amp;rsquo;s stock in the morning and it immediately executes. At this point, you reach an agreement with the seller, but &lt;strong&gt;ownership of the stock and funds has not yet transferred.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T Day Aftermarket ~ T+1 Day (Clearing Period):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exchange sends your trade data to the Central Clearing Corporation (CCP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP confirms the transaction information is accurate and performs a “contract swap,” becoming your counterparty for the trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP calculates the net amount of all your trades on that day through your brokerage firm, and notifies your broker how much money and securities you need to deliver by T+2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T+2 Day (Settlement Day):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the morning, your broker transfers the net settlement funds to the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP confirms receipt of the funds and instructs the Securities Custody Agency to transfer 100 shares of stock from the seller’s brokerage account to your brokerage account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your broker updates your account information internally, showing that you now hold these 100 shares of stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At this point, settlement is complete, and you officially become the legal owner of these 100 shares of stock, with the right to receive dividends, participate in voting, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the traditional concept of “settlement” in stock trading is a product of historical practice combined with modern risk control theory. It evolved from a mechanism to solve the problem of paper-based certificate circulation into a core system that uses a central counterparty and net settlement to ensure the stability and efficiency of the entire financial market. This seemingly &amp;ldquo;delayed&amp;rdquo; design is actually the key firewall protecting every investor from counterparty default risks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Over-the-Counter (OTC) Clearing and Settlement of Digital Currencies: Unveiling the Mechanisms Behind 7x24 Continuous Trading</title>

        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:03:32 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/over-the-counter-otc-clearing-and-settlement-of-digital-currencies-unveiling-the-mechanisms-behind-7x24-continuous-trading/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional stock markets with defined opening and closing times, the digital currency market has attracted the attention of global investors due to its 7x24-hour continuous trading feature. This characteristic has also raised a core question: how are digital currencies cleared and settled in a world without a “market close” concept? Does it completely overturn these concepts in traditional finance? The answer is that digital currencies not only have clearing and settlement, but the way they are implemented and their system design are key to supporting all-day trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;core-difference-from-t2-to-real-time-settlement&#34;&gt;Core Difference: From T+2 to Real-Time Settlement
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional stock trading follows a “T+N” settlement system (e.g., T+1 in China, T+2 in the US), meaning that the actual transfer of funds and securities after a trade is executed (on day T) takes one or more business days to complete. During this period, clearing agencies conduct offsetting, calculate the receivables and payables of each party, and settle differences.
Digital currencies have completely changed this model. Its core settlement and delivery can be summarized as &lt;strong&gt;“Trade-to-Clear, Clear-to-Deliver,”&lt;/strong&gt; primarily due to its underlying blockchain technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockchain-a-natural-real-time-full-settlement-system&#34;&gt;Blockchain: A Natural Real-Time Full Settlement System
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchain itself can be considered a decentralized, immutable public ledger. Each transaction is recorded in a “block” and linked to the previous block through cryptographic methods, forming an irreversible “chain.” This process has the following key characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Time:&lt;/strong&gt; Once a transaction is validated by nodes on the network and packaged into a block, the transfer of assets is completed. Although confirmation times vary depending on the congestion and block generation speed of different blockchain networks (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum), ranging from seconds to several minutes, this is a qualitative leap compared to traditional finance’s “T+N.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Settlement:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike net settlement in traditional clearing systems, each transaction on the blockchain is independent and fully executed. When A transfers a bitcoin to B, it is clearly recorded in the ledger as A&amp;rsquo;s address decreasing by one and B&amp;rsquo;s address increasing by one, without any netting of multiple transactions before transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finality:&lt;/strong&gt; Once a block has been confirmed by enough subsequent blocks, this transaction is considered “final” and irreversible. This means that once settled, no one can undo or modify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, fundamentally, &lt;strong&gt;asset settlement occurs on the blockchain, automatically completed through network consensus, without the need for traditional central clearing counterparties (CCPs) or custodians.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;centralized-vs-decentralized-exchanges-different-clearing-and-settlement-pathways&#34;&gt;Centralized vs. Decentralized Exchanges: Different Clearing and Settlement Pathways
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the underlying technology is decentralized, the primary venues where users conduct digital currency transactions – exchanges – are divided into two types: centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX), which have different clearing and settlement mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;centralized-exchanges-cex-internal-clearing--on-chain-settlement&#34;&gt;Centralized Exchanges (CEX): Internal Clearing + On-Chain Settlement
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When users trade on centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, they are actually operating within the exchange’s internal centralized ledger, rather than directly on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Clearing (Ledgering):&lt;/strong&gt; When users deposit digital currencies or fiat currency into an exchange, the exchange records corresponding balances in its database for the user&amp;rsquo;s account. All buy and sell actions a user takes on the platform, such as buying BTC with USDT, essentially just represents increases and decreases in numbers within different accounts in the exchange’s database. This process is completed quickly by the exchange’s &lt;strong&gt;“matching engine,”&lt;/strong&gt; which can be considered a real-time internal clearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-Chain Settlement (Withdrawal/Deposit):&lt;/strong&gt; The actual settlement that occurs on the blockchain only happens when users &lt;strong&gt;“deposit”&lt;/strong&gt; (transfer from an external wallet into the exchange) and &lt;strong&gt;“withdraw”&lt;/strong&gt; (transfer out of the exchange to an external wallet). At this point, the exchange initiates a chain transaction to truly transfer asset ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Design Key Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Performance Matching Engine:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures rapid order matching under high concurrency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold &amp;amp; Hot Wallet Separation:&lt;/strong&gt; Most user assets are stored in offline “cold wallets” to ensure security, while a small amount of assets is kept in online “hot wallets” to meet users’ daily withdrawal needs. This is the core design for ensuring 7x24 hours of asset safety operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Ledger Database:&lt;/strong&gt; Utilizes a high-performance distributed database to ensure the accuracy and immediacy of internal transaction records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralized-exchanges-dexs-on-chain-atomic-swaps&#34;&gt;Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): On-Chain Atomic Swaps
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and SushiSwap, the trading process is radically different. Users always maintain control over their own wallet private keys, and transactions are executed directly on-chain through “smart contracts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atomic Swap:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the core of how DEXs clear and settle trades. A smart contract is a program that automatically executes on a blockchain, ensuring that the exchange of assets is &amp;ldquo;atomic&amp;rdquo;—either both parties successfully exchange their assets, or neither does—preventing one party from sending assets without receiving confirmation from the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clearing and Settlement Synchronized:&lt;/strong&gt; Users authorize interactions with smart contracts through their wallets. Once a transaction is triggered and confirmed on the blockchain, clearing and settlement are instantly completed in a single step. The entire process requires no trust in any centralized intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Design Key Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Contracts:&lt;/strong&gt; The core logic of the exchange, including trading pairs, liquidity pools, and pricing algorithms (such as Automated Market Makers - AMMs) are all hardcoded into the smart contract, making them public and transparent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-Chain Oracles:&lt;/strong&gt; Used to securely feed external market price information onto the blockchain, providing price references for certain types of DEXs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frontend:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides a web or app interface that allows users to connect their wallets and interact with the backend smart contracts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-the-new-paradigm-for-digital-currency-clearing-and-settlement&#34;&gt;Summary: The New Paradigm for Digital Currency Clearing and Settlement
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence, digital currencies are not without the concepts of clearing and settlement; rather, they have transformed from a multi-party, time-consuming back-office process into an efficient, transparent, and even real-time automated one through blockchain technology and innovative system designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clearing Concepts Remain:&lt;/strong&gt; This is evident in CEXs as real-time matching and ledger accounting, and in DEXs, smart contracts incorporate clearing rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settlement is the Core Transformation:&lt;/strong&gt; Finality of settlement is guaranteed by blockchain consensus, enabling near real-time asset transfers – a cornerstone supporting 7x24 uninterrupted trading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Design Serves Uninterrupted Operation:&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it’s CEX cold and hot wallet architectures or DEX automated smart contracts, the primary design objective is to achieve a transaction environment without manual intervention and never closed, while ensuring security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This disruptive clearing and settlement mechanism is not only a significant distinguishing feature of digital currency markets compared to traditional finance but also provides important insights into the future evolution of financial infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Win11 Pro Professional, Remote Desktop login error: Login failed</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/win11-pro-professional-remote-desktop-login-error-login-failed/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 01:10:10 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/win11-pro-professional-remote-desktop-login-error-login-failed/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The host unexpectedly crashed with a blue screen, preventing it from booting. It’s using UEFI boot format and the system consistently fails to load properly. Switching to an MBR boot format (the older one) allows the system to start normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following standard troubleshooting steps, we enabled remote desktop access, and another machine tested successfully – all network components were functioning correctly. Users log in as usual with their Microsoft accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when attempting to log in via remote desktop, the error message &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Login Failed&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; appears without any further information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this is a system logged in with a Microsoft account, when using Remote Desktop login, it defaults to using the Microsoft account&amp;rsquo;s email address as the username. The system recommends enabling &lt;strong&gt;PIN&lt;/strong&gt; code login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to information found online, the first step is to disable security settings, specifically the &lt;code&gt;To improve security, only allow this device to use Windows Hello sign-in (recommended)&lt;/code&gt; option within the Sign-in Settings.  Disable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-pro-professional-remote-desktop-login-error-login-failed/20250721235800.png&#34;
	width=&#34;470&#34;
	height=&#34;259&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;181&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;435px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key second step is to restart the system. At this point, you will see the login interface with PIN code login removed and an additional &lt;code&gt;Microsoft Account&lt;/code&gt; option. Select account login and manually enter your username and password.  Now, when attempting remote desktop login again, it works normally.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RWA (Real World Assets) and Web3: A New Bottle of Old Wine?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/rwa-real-world-assets-and-web3-a-new-bottle-of-old-wine/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:48:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/rwa-real-world-assets-and-web3-a-new-bottle-of-old-wine/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Driven by the tide of technological innovation, RWA (Real World Assets) and Web3 have become hot topics in the financial industry. Traditional financial institutions – once regarded as conservative and stable giants – are now actively embracing these emerging concepts, vigorously promoting the development of RWA and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). However, behind this technology-driven transformation lies a core question worth pondering: Are these dazzling new concepts truly disruptive innovation, or simply giving traditional financial businesses a “new look”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rwa-and-web3-decoding-core-concepts&#34;&gt;RWA and Web3: Decoding Core Concepts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RWA (Real World Assets), referring to real-world assets,&lt;/strong&gt; are tangible or intangible assets from the physical world that are issued and traded as digital assets on a blockchain through “tokenization” technology. These assets can encompass real estate, bonds, private credit, artwork, carbon credits, and more. Its core value lies in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing Liquidity:&lt;/strong&gt; Dividing illiquid assets (such as real estate) into smaller shares, reducing investment barriers, and enabling them to be traded easily on secondary markets like stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving Transparency and Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; Utilizing blockchain’s immutability and traceability to simplify asset issuance, trading, and settlement processes, reduce intermediaries and human error, ultimately lowering costs and improving efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding Financing Channels:&lt;/strong&gt; Providing asset owners with a globalized, more efficient financing platform, breaking down geographical and traditional financial intermediary restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web3, often referred to as “the next generation internet,”&lt;/strong&gt; has core principles of building a decentralized, user-owned and controlled internet ecosystem. Unlike the Web2 era dominated by a few tech giants, Web3 is based on blockchain technology, aiming to return data ownership and control to users. Its key features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralization:&lt;/strong&gt; Information and applications are no longer stored on single company servers but distributed across numerous nodes in the network, reducing the risk of single points of failure and censorship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Sovereignty:&lt;/strong&gt; Users have greater control over their personal data, choosing with whom to share it and how it is used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permissionless and Censorship-Resistant:&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone can participate in the network, publish applications or use services without needing approval from centralized authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-are-traditional-financial-institutions-embracing-rwa-and-defi&#34;&gt;Why Are Traditional Financial Institutions Embracing RWA and DeFi?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional financial institutions are actively pushing for RWA and DeFi primarily due to the following strategic considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency Gains &amp;amp; Cost Reduction:&lt;/strong&gt; The traditional financial system is characterized by significant manual auditing, complex clearing and settlement processes, and burdensome compliance steps, leading to inefficiency and high costs. Through smart contracts and blockchain technology, DeFi and RWA can automate many of these processes, significantly reducing operational costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating New Revenue Streams &amp;amp; Markets:&lt;/strong&gt; The emergence of RWA has opened up new asset classes and business models for financial institutions. For example, providing tokenized services for real estate or private credit projects, underwriting, and trading can generate new fees and consulting revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responding to Competition &amp;amp; Maintaining Leadership:&lt;/strong&gt; Competition from fintech companies and crypto native enterprises is intensifying. By proactively positioning themselves in RWA and DeFi, traditional financial institutions can demonstrate their innovative capabilities, attract a new generation of clients, and secure a favorable position in the future financial landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing Transparency &amp;amp; Risk Management:&lt;/strong&gt; The transparency offered by blockchain helps improve the visibility of underlying asset information, allowing investors to better assess risks.  Furthermore, standardized token protocols and automated compliance checks can also enhance risk management efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;business-essence-new-wine-in-an-old-bottle&#34;&gt;Business Essence: New Wine in an Old Bottle?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite RWA and DeFi bringing innovation in technology and models, from a core business logic perspective, the current RWA-related businesses undertaken by traditional financial institutions are largely extensions and digital upgrades of their &lt;strong&gt;traditional businesses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking &lt;strong&gt;RWA&lt;/strong&gt; as an example, its core is to tokenize traditional assets. This process bears a striking resemblance to traditional &lt;strong&gt;Asset Securitization (ABS)&lt;/strong&gt;. ABS involves transforming illiquid assets with predictable cash flows into tradable securities in financial markets through packaging and layering. RWA simply shifts the carrier of securitization from traditional electronic certificates to blockchain-based tokens. Its essence remains &lt;strong&gt;credit intermediation and asset management&lt;/strong&gt; – selecting high-quality assets, structuring them, and selling them to investors. For example, packaging the future rental income rights of a commercial property into tokens is no different than issuing Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in terms of its core financial nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in the &lt;strong&gt;DeFi&lt;/strong&gt; sector, although its “decentralized” concept aims to disrupt traditional financial intermediaries, the way current institutions are participating is primarily to &lt;strong&gt;utilize their technological advantages to optimize existing businesses&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, using smart contracts to simplify loan approval and disbursement processes or conducting more efficient cross-border payments and settlements through decentralized exchanges. Its core business of &lt;strong&gt;lending, trading, and payment&lt;/strong&gt; remains the cornerstone of the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can be said that traditional financial institutions driving RWA and DeFi is more like a “self-revolution,” namely, without changing its core financial functions, using new technologies to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and expand markets.&lt;/strong&gt; They are not trying to completely overthrow themselves but rather hope to consolidate and expand their industry position through technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, RWA and Web3 have undoubtedly brought profound changes to the financial industry. They have solved many pain points in traditional finance through technology. However, for traditional financial institutions at this stage, embracing these technologies is more like a cautious and pragmatic strategic choice. Its core business logic has not fundamentally changed, still revolving around assets, credit, and transactions – these ancient financial themes.  As technology matures and regulation improves, we may see more disruptive financial innovations; however, given the current situation, “new wine in an old bottle” is perhaps the most accurate description.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Currency Fundamentals</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/digital-currency-fundamentals/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:30:00 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/digital-currency-fundamentals/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We use an easy-to-understand analogy to explain the relationship between digital currency “mining” and “accounting,” as well as why Bitcoin and Ethereum have different supply caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s use an easy-to-understand analogy to explain the relationship between digital currency “mining” and “accounting,” as well as why Bitcoin and Ethereum have different supply caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mining-and-accounting-a-public-participation-ledger-competition&#34;&gt;Mining and Accounting: A Public Participation Ledger Competition
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine the entire Bitcoin network as a massive, public, and transparent electronic ledger. Every Bitcoin transaction (such as Zhang San sending a Bitcoin to Li Si) that occurs anywhere in the world needs to be recorded onto this large ledger for the transaction to be considered successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who records these transactions? If anyone could just write them down arbitrarily, it would become chaotic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, the Bitcoin system has designed an ongoing “accounting competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounting (Bookkeeping)&lt;/strong&gt;: This involves bundling all transactions that have occurred in the past approximately 10 minutes into a &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo; (which can be understood as a page of the ledger). This block not only includes transaction records but also contains a link to the previous &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo; (the previous page of the ledger), linking one page after another to form an immutable chain, which is called “blockchain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mining&lt;/strong&gt;: The core issue is: who has the right to record this page? The answer is: whoever first solves an extremely complex mathematical problem gets the accounting rights for that time. This solving process is形象地称为“mining”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it called &amp;ldquo;Mining&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/strong&gt; Because this process requires a large amount of computing resources (mining machines) and energy (power), just like real-world mining requires equipment and labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the purpose of solving the problem?&lt;/strong&gt; This mathematical problem itself has no practical meaning; its sole purpose is to increase the difficulty of accounting, ensuring that an average person (or a mining pool) can solve it approximately every 10 minutes. This guarantees stable ledger update speed and ensures system security. Anyone who wants to tamper with the ledger must have twice the computing power of the entire network, which is practically impossible economically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, the relationship between mining and accounting can be summarized as:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Mining” is the process of competing for “accounting rights,” while “Accounting” is the reward and responsibility after successfully “mining.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mining-and-accounting-a-public-participation-ledger-competition-1&#34;&gt;Mining and Accounting: A Public Participation Ledger Competition
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful “miners” who successfully mine a block will perform two tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Package the latest transactions into a new block and connect it to the blockchain (completing the accounting).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receive rewards granted by the system.&lt;/strong&gt; This reward consists of two parts:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block Reward:&lt;/strong&gt; The system automatically generates a batch of newly created Bitcoins as a reward. This is the only way that new Bitcoin is created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transaction Fees:&lt;/strong&gt; The fees paid by the payers of all transactions within the block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-does-bitcoin-have-a-cap-while-ethereum-doesnt&#34;&gt;Why Does Bitcoin Have a Cap, While Ethereum Doesn&amp;rsquo;t?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This involves fundamental differences in the design philosophy and objectives of these two cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bitcoin-digital-gold-limited-supply&#34;&gt;Bitcoin: Digital Gold, Limited Supply
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin was designed from the outset to be a &lt;strong&gt;value storage&lt;/strong&gt; tool like gold. Gold is valuable for one key reason: its scarcity – the amount on Earth is finite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mimic this scarcity, Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, established two immutable rules during design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited Supply:&lt;/strong&gt; The total supply of Bitcoin is permanently limited to &lt;strong&gt;21 million coins&lt;/strong&gt;. Not a fraction more, not a fraction less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Halving Production:&lt;/strong&gt; Approximately every four years (or with every 210,000 blocks mined), the block reward earned by miners will be reduced in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2009 began at 50 BTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2012 halving to 25 BTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2016 halving to 12.5 BTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2020 halving to 6.25 BTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2024 halving to 3.125 BTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…and so on, until approximately 2140, when the new reward will approach zero indefinitely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design gives Bitcoin &lt;strong&gt;deflationary&lt;/strong&gt; characteristics. Over time, the output of new coins decreases, and if demand remains constant or increases, its value theoretically rises. This reinforces its positioning as “digital gold.” Once all bitcoins have been mined, miners’ income will depend entirely on transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ethereum-decentralized-application-platform-more-flexible-supply-strategy&#34;&gt;Ethereum: Decentralized Application Platform, More Flexible Supply Strategy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethereum’s goals differ from Bitcoin. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a digital currency; it’s a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;world computer,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; a platform designed to run smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can imagine Ethereum as a decentralized “app store” and “operating system.” Within this system, you need to pay “gas fees” to run your programs or make transactions, and this gas is Ether (ETH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maintain this vast and complex system, Ethereum continuously incentivizes miners (now validators) to protect the network’s security. If a hard cap were set like Bitcoin’s, with no new coins being mined after it&amp;rsquo;s finished, whether transaction fees alone would be sufficient to guarantee the network’s long-term security is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Ethereum chose a &lt;strong&gt;no-hard-cap&lt;/strong&gt; strategy. However, this doesn’t mean it will experience unlimited inflation. Ethereum’s monetary policy has undergone several significant adjustments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early (Proof-of-Work PoW)&lt;/strong&gt;: Similar to Bitcoin, new coins were generated through mining, but there was no fixed total limit or set halving cycle. This resulted in a relatively high inflation rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;London Upgrade (EIP-1559)&lt;/strong&gt;: Introduced an “burn fee” mechanism. A portion of the base fees paid by users for transactions would be directly “burned” (permanently removed from circulation) instead of going to miners. This meant that when the network was active with transactions, the amount of ETH burned could exceed the newly issued amount, leading to &lt;strong&gt;deflation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Merge (The Merge)&lt;/strong&gt;: Ethereum transitioned from “mining” (Proof-of-Work PoW) to “staking” (Proof-of-Stake PoS). No longer do miners expend electricity solving problems; instead, “validators” earn accounting rights and rewards by staking their own ETH. This shift &lt;strong&gt;significantly reduced the issuance rate of new ETH&lt;/strong&gt; (over 90%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary, here are Ethereum’s key characteristics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Hard Cap&lt;/strong&gt;: Provides flexibility for the network&amp;rsquo;s long-term security and development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Supply&lt;/strong&gt;: Through “burn mechanisms” and “staking rewards,” its total supply can be mildly inflationary or experience deflation during periods of high transaction activity. Its goal isn’t absolute scarcity, but rather to &lt;strong&gt;maintain sufficient security while ensuring ETH remains available as “fuel.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-old-then-new-distribution-method-explained&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;First Old, Then New&amp;rdquo; Distribution Method Explained
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimi: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Existing shareholders first old shares then new&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; is a &lt;strong&gt;common Hong Kong distribution method&lt;/strong&gt;, known in English as &lt;strong&gt;Top-up Placement&lt;/strong&gt;, which you can understand as a two-step operation of “&lt;strong&gt;major shareholders sell old shares first and then subscribe to new shares&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-lets-take-an-example-to-understand-it&#34;&gt;✅ Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example to understand it
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking the case of &lt;strong&gt;Jiutian Intelligence Investment&lt;/strong&gt; as an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Major shareholders sell old shares (First Old)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing shareholders (such as Coreworth Investments) sell their existing holdings of &lt;strong&gt;20,000,000 old shares&lt;/strong&gt; to market investors (the underwriter) at a price of HKD 39.25 per share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This results in the &lt;strong&gt;major shareholder reducing their holding&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;total issued capital remains unchanged&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Company issues new shares to major shareholders (Later New)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company then issues an equal number (&lt;strong&gt;20,000,000 shares&lt;/strong&gt;) of new shares to these major shareholders at a price of HKD 39.25.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The major shareholder uses the proceeds from selling old shares to buy back new shares, &lt;strong&gt;restoring their holding quantity to its original state&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the total issued capital increases (from 448 million shares to 468 million shares), &lt;strong&gt;effectively meaning the company has successfully raised capital&lt;/strong&gt;, while the &lt;strong&gt;major shareholder&amp;rsquo;s shareholding ratio is slightly diluted&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Fundraising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Avoid the lengthy process of issuing new shares, instead selling old shares first and then supplementing with new shares to quickly raise capital.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The majority shareholders will maintain their voting power, and control won&amp;rsquo;t be significantly diluted.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hong-kong-stock-connect-issuance-rules-interpretation&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Stock Connect Issuance Rules Interpretation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimi: Your question is very central: &lt;strong&gt;Why do Hong Kong-listed companies seem to be able to “freely” issue shares? Is the Hong Kong market rulebook particularly relaxed?&lt;/strong&gt;
The answer is: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, HKEX offers significantly more flexibility than the Shanghai A-share market&lt;/strong&gt;, but it’s &lt;strong&gt;not “unlimited,”&lt;/strong&gt; rather there&amp;rsquo;s a system of &lt;strong&gt;“relaxed but limited” rules.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it require shareholder meeting approval?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅ The Board of Directors can authorize share issuance not exceeding &lt;strong&gt;20% of the total equity&lt;/strong&gt; annually at the annual general meeting, and no further meetings are required thereafter.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌ Each issuance must be held with a &lt;strong&gt;separate shareholder meeting&lt;/strong&gt; and pass by a 2/3 majority vote.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it require SEC approval?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌ As long as it’s no more than 20% of share capital + offering price is no more than 20%, it can “flash allocation”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅ Must undergo SEC &lt;strong&gt;case-by-case review&lt;/strong&gt;, which takes longer&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;-why-does-the-hong-kong-stock-exchange-look-casual&#34;&gt;✅ Why Does the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Look “Casual”?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“General Mandate” Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt;
Once a year, shareholders authorize the board to issue up to 20% new shares at their annual general meeting. Afterwards, &lt;strong&gt;no further shareholder meetings are required&lt;/strong&gt;, and the board can selectively issue shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Flash Placement” Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt;
If the issuance does not exceed 20% of the share capital and the discount is no more than 20%, &lt;strong&gt;the issuance can be completed within 24 hours without approval&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No SEC Case-by-Case Approval:
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange only conducts &lt;strong&gt;formative review&lt;/strong&gt;, without substantive intervention in the use of funds or company quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-lets-take-an-example-why-was-jiufang-zhitou-able-to-do-old-and-new-this-time&#34;&gt;✅ Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example: Why was JiuFang ZhiTou able to &amp;ldquo;do old and new&amp;rdquo; this time?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JiuFang ZhiTou obtained a &lt;strong&gt;general authorization&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;strong&gt;2025 June 20th shareholder meeting&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing for up to a 20% increase in new shares (i.e., up to 89,671,400 shares).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This issuance of 20,000,000 shares represents only &lt;strong&gt;4.46% of the capital&lt;/strong&gt;, far below the 20% limit, and &lt;strong&gt;fully complies with the authorization conditions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;no further shareholder meeting is needed&lt;/strong&gt; nor &lt;strong&gt;is approval from the Securities Regulatory Commission required&lt;/strong&gt;; the board of directors can make the decision to implement it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-summary-in-one-sentence-1&#34;&gt;✅ Summary in one sentence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong stocks allow “board of directors + annual authorization” rapid issuance under a streamlined process, provided it doesn’t exceed 20% of the share capital and the price cap, enabling “flash placement,” while A-shares require shareholder approval plus SEC review, resulting in a longer, more restrictive procedure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-summary-in-one-sentence-2&#34;&gt;✅ Summary in one sentence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Jiu Fang Zhi Tu (Nine Fang Intelligent Investment) is not “arbitrary issuance,” but rather &lt;strong&gt;legally and compliantly utilized the relaxed mechanisms of the Hong Kong stock market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/comprehensive-analysis-capital-gains-tax-crs-and-inland-residents-hong-kong-us-stock-investment-tax-guide/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For mainland residents investing in Hong Kong and US stocks, understanding relevant tax regulations is crucial. This article will comprehensively analyze what capital gains tax is, why it applies to investments in Hong Kong and US stocks, and explain the workings of CRS (Common Reporting Standard). Furthermore, this article will also provide detailed answers regarding the tax responsibilities and specific tax rates for mainland residents investing in Hong Kong and US stocks through various channels (Hong Kong brokers, Hong Kong-Shanghai Link, and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Link).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;core-concept-breakdown&#34;&gt;Core Concept Breakdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-capital-gains-tax-cgt&#34;&gt;What is Capital Gains Tax (CGT)?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital Gains Tax (CGT), often abbreviated as CGT, is a tax levied on the &lt;strong&gt;profits realized from selling assets&lt;/strong&gt;. These assets can include stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, and more. When you sell an asset for a price higher than your purchase price, the resulting gains (known as capital gains) may be subject to Capital Gains Tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that not all countries or regions levy Capital Gains Tax. For example, Hong Kong currently does not impose Capital Gains Tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-are-hong-kong-and-us-stocks-subject-to-capital-gains-tax&#34;&gt;Why are Hong Kong and US Stocks Subject to Capital Gains Tax?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Stocks:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States is a country that levies capital gains tax. For non-U.S. taxpayers (such as most mainland investors), while selling US stocks typically qualifies for exemption from capital gains tax, certain conditions must be met (e.g., residency in the U.S. for no more than 183 days within a year). However, dividends received from US stocks are subject to withholding income tax at a rate of usually 30%, but according to the China-U.S. Tax Agreement, mainland Chinese residents can apply to reduce this rate to 10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong Stocks:&lt;/strong&gt; As stated above, Hong Kong does not levy capital gains tax. Therefore, regardless of the channel through which you trade Hong Kong stocks, no tax is payable on the difference between purchase and sale prices. This doesn’t mean that mainland residents don&amp;rsquo;t need to declare this income to the Chinese mainland tax authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-crs-reporting-common-reporting-standard&#34;&gt;What is CRS Reporting (Common Reporting Standard)?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRS, or the “Common Reporting Standard,” is a global standard for the automatic exchange of financial account information. Its primary purpose is to combat tax evasion involving offshore accounts and cross-border tax avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it Works:&lt;/strong&gt; In simple terms, financial institutions (such as banks and brokers) that have signed up to CRS need to identify the non-resident taxpayers’ accounts and report their account information (including names, addresses, taxpayer status, account balances, and annual total income) to their local tax authorities. These tax authorities then exchange this information with the relevant tax authorities of the countries/territories where the account holders are residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Mainland Investors:&lt;/strong&gt; For mainland residents who open accounts with Hong Kong brokers, due to their tax residency being China, Hong Kong financial institutions will exchange their account information through the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department to the Chinese State Taxation Administration. This means that the inland tax authorities can gain access to information about its residents’ overseas financial assets and income, providing a basis for collecting global income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;inland-resident-hong-kong--us-stock-trading-tax-breakdown&#34;&gt;Inland Resident Hong Kong &amp;amp; US Stock Trading Tax Breakdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to China’s Personal Income Tax Law, Chinese tax residents are required to pay personal income tax on their &lt;strong&gt;income sourced globally&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that even if investment gains occur abroad and may be exempt in the local jurisdiction, there is still an obligation to declare and pay taxes to the Chinese tax authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Chinese tax department has intensified its enforcement of taxation regarding individual overseas income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trading-hong-kong-and-us-stocks-via-hong-kong-brokers&#34;&gt;Trading Hong Kong and US Stocks via Hong Kong Brokers
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a mainland resident, trading Hong Kong and US stocks through Hong Kong brokers (such as Futu Securities, Tiger Brokerage, etc.), your tax responsibilities are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Stock Trading:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Gains:&lt;/strong&gt; The profits you receive from the difference between buying and selling US stocks belong to “transfer pricing income.” According to China’s Personal Income Tax Law, it should be declared and paid at a rate of &lt;strong&gt;20%&lt;/strong&gt; to the Chinese tax authorities. Although the United States typically exempts non-residents from capital gains taxes, Chinese tax residents still need to pay taxes on this global income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dividends:&lt;/strong&gt; Dividends received from US stocks will usually have 10% withheld by the broker as estimated income tax (enjoying preferential tax agreements between China and the US). This tax paid abroad can be offset when declaring it in China, but the offset amount cannot exceed the taxable amount calculated according to Chinese tax laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong Stock Trading:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Gains:&lt;/strong&gt; Although Hong Kong does not levy capital gains tax, profits from Hong Kong stock trading (price differences) are also considered “transfer pricing income” and must be declared and paid at a rate of &lt;strong&gt;20%&lt;/strong&gt; to the Chinese tax authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dividends:&lt;/strong&gt; Dividends received from H shares (companies registered in mainland China and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange) will have 20% personal income tax withheld by the company. Dividends received from non-H shares (companies registered in Hong Kong or overseas and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange) will have 10% dividend tax withheld in Hong Kong. This tax paid abroad can also be offset when declaring it in China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To promote capital market connectivity between Mainland China and Hong Kong, the government has introduced targeted tax incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For dividend income received from investing in &lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong H Shares&lt;/strong&gt; via the HKSAR-Mainland China Bond Connect (HK &amp;amp; SH), the H Share company will withhold personal income tax at a rate of &lt;strong&gt;20%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For dividend income received from investing in &lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong Non-H Shares&lt;/strong&gt; via the HKSAR-Mainland China Bond Connect (HK &amp;amp; SH), China Merchants Service Bureau will withhold personal income tax at a rate of &lt;strong&gt;20%&lt;/strong&gt;. Any pre-paid personal income tax paid in Hong Kong can be claimed for tax refund by submitting a valid withholding certificate to the relevant tax authority of China Merchants Service Bureau.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Premium Whole Life Insurance Policy Interpretation</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/premium-whole-life-insurance-policy-interpretation/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 21:13:58 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/premium-whole-life-insurance-policy-interpretation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult for ordinary people to understand a policy document, and traditional financial planning is based on understanding annualized returns. However, the calculation method of an increasing term life insurance policy is Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and there&amp;rsquo;s a difference between these two – what’s the difference and why does it exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When funds are invested in one go, &lt;strong&gt;Internal Rate of Return (IRR)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Annualized Return (Annualized Return)&lt;/strong&gt; produce the same results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;laymans-explanation&#34;&gt;Layman&amp;rsquo;s Explanation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you planted a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lump Sum Investment:&lt;/strong&gt; You invested the money to buy the sapling and the fertilizer for the first year all at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annualized Return:&lt;/strong&gt; This is like measuring how much your tree grows each year, then calculating the average percentage it grows by per year. It measures how much your money grew on average over one year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRR (Internal Rate of Return):&lt;/strong&gt; The IRR concept is broader and can handle situations with multiple cash inflows and outflows. However, in a simple scenario where you have a single investment and a single return, IRR also seeks to find an “average annual growth rate” that makes the money grow at this percentage over time, exactly equaling the amount you finally receive back.
Because in a single investment, single return scenario, there are no intermediate cash flows (like regular dividends or additional investments), the calculation of IRR is simplified into finding a compound annual growth rate, which is exactly what the annualized return expresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-example&#34;&gt;An Example
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Investment:&lt;/strong&gt; On January 1st, 2024, you invested &lt;strong&gt;10,000 yuan&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Term:&lt;/strong&gt; 3 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Return:&lt;/strong&gt; On January 1st, 2027, you received back &lt;strong&gt;13,310 yuan&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-annualized-return&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Annualized Return:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formula for calculating annualized return is:
&lt;/p&gt;
$$\text{Annualized Return} = \left( \frac{\text{Ending Value}}{\text{Beginning Value}} \right)^{\frac{1}{\text{Investment Period}}} - 1$$
&lt;p&gt;
Substituting the data:
&lt;/p&gt;
$$\text{Annualized Return} = \left( \frac{13310}{10000} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} - 1$$
$$\text{Annualized Return} = (1.331)^{0.3333} - 1$$
$$\text{Annualized Return} = 1.1 - 1 = 0.1 = 10\%$$
&lt;p&gt;
Therefore, the annualized return on this investment is &lt;strong&gt;10%&lt;/strong&gt;. This means your money grew an average of 10% per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-internal-rate-of-return-irr&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Internal Rate of Return (IRR):&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;IRR is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows zero. In this example, the cash flows include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 1, 2024: -10,000 (Cash outflow – investment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 1, 2027: +13,310 (Investment recovery)
We need to find a discount rate &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; such that:
$$-10000 + \frac{13310}{(1+r)^3} = 0$$
$$\frac{13310}{(1+r)^3} = 10000$$
$$(1+r)^3 = \frac{13310}{10000} = 1.331$$
$$1+r = (1.331)^{\frac{1}{3}}$$
$$1+r = 1.1$$
$$r = 1.1 - 1 = 0.1 = 10\%$$
Therefore, the internal rate of return (IRR) for this investment is &lt;strong&gt;10%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this simple example of a one-time investment and one-time recovery, you will find that the results of calculating the annualized yield and internal rate of return are identical. This is because in this specific case, the IRR calculation logic is equivalent to the compound interest calculation logic used to determine the annualized yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRR truly comes into play when an investment involves &lt;strong&gt;multiple cash flows&lt;/strong&gt;, such as investing in a fund where you contribute money each month, or investing in a project that pays dividends at different points in time and ultimately recovers a final sum of money. In this complex cash flow pattern, the annualized yield may not accurately measure the true return on investment, while IRR can better reflect the time value of money and the overall rate of return for the investment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where can I find backtest data?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/where-can-i-find-backtest-data/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2025 19:33:56 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/where-can-i-find-backtest-data/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Backtesting requires: proportionate method (price-weighted return method), a simple explanation, and examples. Also, why cannot use add-subtract method for adjustment, and recommendations for Python historical data sources using the proportionate method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s explain the “proportionate method (price-weighted return method)” in an easy-to-understand way, along with why the &amp;ldquo;add-subtract method&amp;rdquo; is not suitable, and we’ll recommend some Python historical data sources using the proportionate method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;core-concepts-why-is-time-weighting-necessary&#34;&gt;Core Concepts: Why is Time-Weighting Necessary?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the world of investing, stock prices don&amp;rsquo;t just fluctuate due to buying and selling. Corporate actions, such as &lt;strong&gt;dividends, stock splits, and cash dividends&lt;/strong&gt;, directly impact share prices, but these changes don’t reflect the company’s true value growth or decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that yesterday your stock closed at a price of 100 yuan. Today, the company decides to pay out a dividend of 5 yuan per share. This process is called “ex-dividend.”  When the dividend is paid, the company&amp;rsquo;s total value decreases, so the exchange will lower the stock price by 5 yuan, opening at 95 yuan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you directly used 95 yuan and yesterday’s 100 yuan to calculate the percentage change, you would arrive at a &lt;code&gt;-5%&lt;/code&gt; conclusion. This is clearly incorrect because you now have 5 yuan in your account, and your total assets haven&amp;rsquo;t decreased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-Weighting (Reinvestment/Adjustment)&lt;/strong&gt; aims to fill in these price “gaps” caused by non-market transactions (such as dividends, stock splits) and restore the true trend of the stock price, allowing you to accurately calculate returns and perform strategy backtesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;percentage-method-earnings-per-share-adjusted-method-a-simple-example-explanation&#34;&gt;Percentage Method (Earnings Per Share Adjusted Method): A Simple Example Explanation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Idea:&lt;/strong&gt; The percentage method assumes that all dividends and stock splits you receive are immediately repurchased at the prevailing price on the date they are received. It focuses on &lt;strong&gt;“the growth rate of total assets”&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
Assume you bought 1 share of “Magic Company” stock for &lt;strong&gt;$100&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;Day 1&lt;/strong&gt;. Your total asset is &lt;strong&gt;$100&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;strong&gt;On Day 2&lt;/strong&gt;, the market hasn’t changed, but Magic Company announces a &amp;ldquo;cash dividend&amp;rdquo; of &lt;strong&gt;$2&lt;/strong&gt; per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the dividend payout, the price automatically drops from $100 to &lt;strong&gt;$98&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, your holding is: 1 share stock (valued at $98) + $2 cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your &lt;strong&gt;total assets&lt;/strong&gt; remain at $98 + $2 = &lt;strong&gt;$100&lt;/strong&gt;, unchanged.
&lt;strong&gt;On Day 3&lt;/strong&gt;, the market rises, and Magic Company’s stock price increases from $98 to &lt;strong&gt;$102.9&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the increase? It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;(102.9 - 98) / 98 = 5%&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much are your total assets now worth?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you didn’t reinvest the dividend: 1 share stock (valued at $102.9) + $2 cash = &lt;strong&gt;$104.9&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we use the &lt;strong&gt;percentage method&lt;/strong&gt; to calculate a “adjusted” price, we assume that the $2 cash was bought back on day 2 at $98. But for simplicity, the percentage method directly multiplies the previous price by today’s rise or fall.
&lt;strong&gt;Percentage Method Calculation Logic:&lt;/strong&gt;
It assumes that the total assets (100) on Day 2 and Day 1 compared to each other have a growth rate of 0%. The total assets on Day 3 compared to Day 2 have a growth rate of 5%.
So, it will construct a continuous, adjusted price sequence:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1 Adjusted Price:&lt;/strong&gt; $100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2 Adjusted Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the total asset hasn’t changed, it will “discount” yesterday’s closing price to reflect today&amp;rsquo;s actual situation. The method is to multiply yesterday’s adjusted price by today’s real rise or fall. On the dividend payout day, the real rise or fall is 0 (because the total assets haven’t changed), so the adjusted price remains unchanged, or we directly look at Day 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3 Adjusted Price:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;Day 1 Adjusted Price * (1 + 0%) * (1 + 5%)&lt;/code&gt; is inaccurate. The correct logic is that it will use the pre-dividend price as a baseline and then perform a “discounting”.
Let’s understand a more clear &lt;strong&gt;pre-adjusted&lt;/strong&gt; perspective:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3&lt;/strong&gt; closing price is &lt;strong&gt;$102.9&lt;/strong&gt;. (Baseline)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2&lt;/strong&gt; closing price is &lt;strong&gt;$98&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1&lt;/strong&gt; closing price is $100, but because Day 2 has a dividend payout (the price drops from $100 to $98, equivalent to a discount of &lt;code&gt;98/100 = 0.98&lt;/code&gt;), we need to adjust the first day’s price according to this proportion.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjusted first day price = &lt;code&gt;102.9 / (1 + 5%) / (100/98)&lt;/code&gt; … This calculation is very complex.
&lt;strong&gt;The simplest way to understand (Percentage Method):&lt;/strong&gt;
The core of the percentage method is to ensure that the rise and fall of any two adjusted prices in a period equals the total return rate you would have obtained if you had reinvested all dividends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Day 1 closing price to Day 3 closing price, your real total return is &lt;code&gt;(104.9 - 100) / 100 = 4.9%&lt;/code&gt;. (Assuming you didn’t reinvest).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the dividend is immediately invested, on Day 3 your total assets will be &lt;code&gt;100 * (1 + 5%) = 105&lt;/code&gt; (because all $100 are in stocks and enjoy a 5% growth).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, the adjusted price sequence’s rise and fall should be 5%.
&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; The percentage method (Earnings Per Share Adjusted Method) adjusts historical prices to ensure that any period&amp;rsquo;s price rises and falls precisely correspond to the total return rate you would have obtained if you had reinvested all dividends. This is the most accurate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-cannot-use-add-subtract-reconciliation&#34;&gt;Why Cannot Use “Add-Subtract Reconciliation”?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Idea:&lt;/strong&gt; Add-subtract reconciliation attempts to simply add the dividend amounts back into the pre-dividend stock price through addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example (Using the previous text):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1&lt;/strong&gt; Closing Price: 100 yuan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2&lt;/strong&gt; Dividend payout of 2 yuan, Closing Price: 98 yuan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3&lt;/strong&gt; Increases by 5%, Closing Price: 102.9 yuan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Flawed Logic of Add-Subtract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will assume that the 98 yuan on Day 2 is because of a 2 yuan dividend deduction, so it should add this 2 yuan “back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It calculates the second day’s “adjusted price” as 98 + 2 = 100 yuan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It calculates the third day’s “adjusted price” as 102.9 + 2 = 104.9 yuan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s use this “adjusted price” sequence to calculate the percentage change on Day 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentage Change = &lt;code&gt;(104.9 - 100) / 100 = 4.9%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where Does the Error Lie?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 4.9% percentage change is incorrect! As we analyzed earlier, the actual percentage increase in the stock price is &lt;code&gt;(102.9 - 98) / 98 = 5%&lt;/code&gt;. The add-subtract method underestimates the true growth potential of the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Does It Underestimate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because add-subtract does not consider the “compound interest” effect.  The proportional method assumes that your 2 yuan dividend also grows at a rate of 5%, while add-subtract crudely assumes this 2 yuan is always 2 yuan, without participating in subsequent investment appreciation. Over time and with increasing dividend payments, this error will become larger, seriously distorting your backtesting results, especially for high-dividend stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In one sentence:&lt;/strong&gt; Add-subtract destroys the “growth rate” information of the price sequence, leading to incorrect yield calculations; proportional method preserves the true “yield,” making it the correct choice for backtesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;python-getting-historical-data-ratio-method-data-source-recommendations&#34;&gt;Python Getting Historical Data “Ratio Method” Data Source Recommendations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, we often don&amp;rsquo;t need to calculate the adjustments ourselves. Professional data providers directly offer already adjusted prices. You simply select the correct price type when calling the API. This is commonly referred to as &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Adjusted Price&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; (Adjusted Pricing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some highly-rated and effective data sources for obtaining back-adjusted historical data through Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;yfinance (Yahoo Finance)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt; Completely free, easy to use, the preferred choice for individual developers and beginners. The data it provides is already back-adjusted using the ratio method (forward-adjusted).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt; Data may have occasional cleaning issues or delays. For very rigorous business strategies, a more professional data source might be needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python Usage Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TuShare&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt; A very popular financial data interface in China, providing rich data for A-shares, Hong Kong shares, US stocks, etc. Data quality is high, with a points system, but basic data is free. It offers clear adjustment factors and back-adjusted行情 (market data) interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires registration to obtain a token; some advanced data or high frequency calls require points.&lt;/li&gt;

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-options-code-analysis-sst1g182500500u-why-is-the-underlying-stock-code-sst-1-instead-of-sst/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This report aims to deeply analyze the U.S. equity options code “SST1G182500500.U,” particularly why its underlying stock code portion is displayed as “SST 1” instead of the original “SST” when sent to Interactive Brokers (IB). By analyzing the standardization structure of option symbols, related company behavior, and broker’s internal processing mechanisms, this report will elucidate the reasons behind this phenomenon and its impact on options traders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;us-equity-options-symbol-standardization-osi&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Equity Options Symbol Standardization (OSI)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the efficient operation and transparency of the options market, the U.S. Option Clearing Corporation (OCC) has established a standardized options symbol system known as the Options Symbol Initiative (OSI). This system employs a unified alphanumeric format to clearly encode key information about the option contract &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Since February 12, 2010, the 21-character OSI standard has been fully implemented in the United States and Canada, replacing the previous chaotic five-character code format &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A standard OSI options symbol typically contains the following four core components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underlying Asset Code (Root Symbol)&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the code for the underlying stock or ETF that the option is based on.  This field can contain up to six characters, and is usually the same as the trading code for the underlying stock. For example, the root symbol for Nike options is “NKE” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If the root symbol is less than six characters, it must be padded with spaces to reach a length of six characters &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expiration Date&lt;/strong&gt;: This portion consists of six digits representing the expiration date in “year year-month month-day day (yymmdd)” format. For example, &amp;ldquo;220624&amp;rdquo; represents an option that expires on June 24, 2022 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call/Put Indicator&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a single-character field indicating the type of option. ‘C’ represents a call option (Call Option), which grants the holder the right to purchase the underlying stock at a specified price; ‘P’ represents a put option (Put Option), which grants the holder the right to sell the underlying stock at a specified price &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strike Price&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the preset price at which the option can be exercised to buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying stock. In the OSI format, the strike price is represented by eight digits, with the last three digits representing the decimal place (“mills,” hundredths of a dollar). To read the actual strike price, you must divide these eight digits by 1,000, or move the decimal point three places to the left. For example, “00099000” represents a strike price of $99.00 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref3:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options, as derivatives, derive their value from the underlying asset. Most U.S. options are traded on exchanges such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and cleared through the OCC. As the world’s largest equity derivative clearing organization, the OCC operates under the supervision of the SEC and CFTC to ensure the stability and integrity of the options market &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref4:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;parsing-option-code-sst1g182500500u&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parsing Option Code SST1G182500500.U&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The option code “SST1G182500500.U” includes some elements of the OSI format, but also contains non-standard representations. This is often due to company-specific adjustments or broker internal display conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sst1-adjusted-underlying-code&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SST1: Adjusted Underlying Code&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“SST1” is the most important part of this option code, directly answering users’ core question about why the underlying code is “SST 1” rather than “SST.” The “1” suffix indicates that this option contract has undergone adjustments due to company actions (such as stock splits or mergers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to OCC’s official memorandum #56689, dated June 11, 2025, which clearly states: “Option symbol: SST changed to SST1,” effective date is June 12, 2025 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This memo provides a clear explanation as to why the underlying symbol is “SST1.” Brokers like Robinhood have also confirmed this convention, stating that “if held option contracts on shares experience a reverse split…the stock code will be appended with a number. For example, if holding ABC options contracts, after a reverse split they will display as ABC1” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This industry standard further confirms the validity and purpose of the “SST1” suffix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;g1825-expiration-date-non-standard-format&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G1825: Expiration Date (Non-Standard Format)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “G1825” portion differs significantly from the OSI standard’s “Year-Month-Day (yymmdd)” format (e.g., 2025 July 18 should be “250718”) &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref5:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
Prior to OSI implementation, option symbols were typically represented by single-letter codes for the month of expiration &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In this older convention, the letter “G” represented the call option for July &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If following this logic, “18” would represent the date, and “25” would represent the year. Therefore, “G1825” most likely represents &lt;strong&gt;July 18, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the OSI standard’s explicit deprecation of this letter-code expiration date representation &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref3:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, “SST1” (a common OSI adjustment convention) persists alongside “G1825,” indicating that Interactive Brokers or its data sources may employ a hybrid or internal representation. This could be a legacy format for adjusting options, or a proprietary display convention used by the broker combining elements of the old symbol system with new adjustment indicators. The inconsistency in option symbols – the core OSI adjustment root symbol coexisting with a non-standard expiration date format – reflects the challenges in financial data standardization at the “last mile.” While central institutions strive for uniformity, brokers may introduce subtle variations or additional identifiers due to compatibility concerns, internal data management considerations, or platform functionality. This results in potential discrepancies between the “official” OSI symbol and the symbols a user might see or need to input on a specific trading platform. Therefore, options traders not only need to understand the general OSI standard but also must be aware of and adapt to any subtle differences in symbol representation employed by individual brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;00500-strike-price&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;00500: Strike Price&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “00500” provided by the user represents a five-digit number, which does not align with the eight-digit strike price field in the OSI standard [1]. If following OSI rules, dividing the eight digits by 1,000 would yield a strike price of $0.50 (as “00000500” equates to $0.50).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that SST stock underwent a reverse split of 10 shares for every 1 share [9], strike prices are typically adjusted according to the split ratio (e.g., a $5.00 strike price would become $0.50 after a 1:10 split), making a very low strike price like $0.50 entirely reasonable for the adjusted options. The five digits “00500” likely represent the value 500, and when converted to “mills” (one-thousandth of a dollar), it equates to $0.50. The discrepancy in digit count may indicate that IB’s internal representation truncates leading zeros for very small strike prices before converting to the full 8-digit OSI format, or utilizes a different internal encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;u-broker-specific-suffix&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.U: Broker-Specific Suffix&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;.U&amp;rdquo; suffix is not part of the standardized OCC/OSI 21 character format ¹. It is highly likely to be an internal identifier or marker used by Interactive Brokers (IB) or its specific market data vendors. Such suffixes are common in proprietary systems, used to convey additional information about contracts, such as their listed exchange, specific trading characteristics, or a unique identifier within their database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-focus-sst1-root-symbol&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Focus: SST1 Root Symbol&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite potential minor deviations from the strict OSI specification for other option symbols, the “SST1” root symbol is undoubtedly the most critical element. It directly addresses the user’s core question and points to the company behavior that led to the symbol changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;company-behaviors-impact-system1-inc-ssts-reverse-split&#34;&gt;Company Behavior&amp;rsquo;s Impact: System1, Inc. (SST)&amp;rsquo;s Reverse Split
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;corporate-actions-universal-impact-on-option-contracts-adjustment&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate Actions&amp;rsquo; Universal Impact on Option Contracts Adjustment&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Options are financial derivatives whose value is directly derived from the underlying asset, such as stock [1]. Therefore, any significant event affecting the underlying security (typically referred to as corporate actions) must be reflected in the terms of open option contracts. This ensures that the economic value and integrity of the derivative remain intact [^13].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate actions encompass a wide range of events, including stock splits (both forward and reverse), mergers, acquisitions, special dividends, and spin-offs [^13]. Each type of action can have a unique impact on option contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearing Corporations (CCs) play a crucial role as the central clearinghouses for options in the United States. They are legally responsible for determining and implementing necessary adjustments to open option contracts in response to these corporate actions [^13]. These adjustments are formally communicated to market participants through detailed OCC Information Notices &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method of adjustment varies depending on the corporate action, but may include changes to the option’s strike price, the number of shares (or other asset, referred to as the deliverable) represented by each contract, or even the option symbol itself. The overall objective of these adjustments is to preserve the total intrinsic value of the option contracts for option holders [^13].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reverse-stock-splits-and-their-typical-impact-on-option-terms&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverse Stock Splits and Their Typical Impact on Option Terms&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reverse stock split is a corporate action designed to reduce the number of outstanding shares while proportionally increasing the price per share&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, a 1-for-10 reverse split means that shareholders previously holding ten shares now own one share, but the value of the new share is theoretically ten times that of the old share&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For options contracts, reverse splits typically require adjustments to contract terms. The OCC (Options Clearing Corporation) is responsible for determining the specific adjustment methods, which may involve changing the number of underlying shares represented by each option contract (e.g., in a 1:10 split, reducing from 100 shares to 10 shares) and/or proportionally increasing the strike price[^13]. The goal is to ensure that the total value represented by the contracts remains consistent with the value before the split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common results of reverse stock splits are changes in option symbols, typically adding a numerical suffix to the original stock code (e.g., “1”). This helps distinguish these adjusted contracts from newly issued standard options after the split&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A significant side effect is that these adjusted options often experience a substantial decline in liquidity[^13].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;system1-inc-sst-1-for-10-reverse-stock-split-details&#34;&gt;System1, Inc. (SST) 1-for-10 Reverse Stock Split Details
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;System1, Inc. (NYSE: SST) is a full-channel customer acquisition marketing platform that announced a 1-for-10 reverse stock split. This corporate action became effective prior to the market open on June 12, 2025 &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary motivation for this reverse split was to increase the per-share trading price of its Class A common stock, allowing the company to regain compliance with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing requirements &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref3:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a direct result of this split, each 10 shares of common stock (including restricted and outstanding shares) automatically converted into 1 new share &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This significantly reduced the total number of issued and outstanding Class A common shares from approximately 79.8 million to 7.98 million &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the reverse split, the company’s Class A common stock continued to trade on the New York Stock Exchange using its existing trading code “SST”, but the CUSIP number was updated &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;occs-role-in-determining-and-implementing-adjustments-the-symbolic-change-from-sst-to-sst1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OCC’s Role in Determining and Implementing Adjustments: The Symbolic Change from SST to SST1&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address System1, Inc.’s reverse stock split, OCC issued memorandum #56689 on June 11, 2025, detailing the specific adjustments for options contracts &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref3:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo explicitly stated that, effective June 12, 2025, “Option Symbol: SST changed to SST1” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref4:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This official instruction from OCC was the direct cause of the “SST1” root symbol appearing in user option codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo further clarified the adjustment terms: “Contract Multiplier: 1. Strike Price Divider: 1. New Multiplier: 100 (e.g., for any dollar extension to premium or strike price, 1.00 would equal $100)” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref5:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This indicated that while the nominal contract multiplier remained at 100, the underlying asset referenced by the “SST1” symbol had been adjusted to reflect a split of 10 shares for every 1 reverse stock split, effectively maintaining the total contract value. The memo explicitly stated, “The price of SST1 will be determined as follows: SST1 = 0.10 (SST)” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref6:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This meant that each “SST1” option contract now represented 100 units, but each unit corresponded to 0.1 shares of the original SST stock, thereby preserving the total contract value after the split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;occ-adjustments-to-sst-option-underlyings&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OCC Adjustments to SST Option Underlyings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, OCC’s adjustments to existing SST options contracts aim to maintain the total economic value of the contracts. OCC did not change the number of shares per contract from 100 to 10 (which could occur in some split scenarios), but instead chose to adjust the &lt;strong&gt;underlying symbol itself to “SST1”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “SST1” symbol indicates that the option contract continues to represent 100 units, but each unit now corresponds to 0.1 shares of the original SST stock &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref7:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, an “SST1” option contract effectively represents 100 * 0.1 = 10 shares after the 10-for-1 split. The strike price remains nominal in the symbol, but is now applied to this revalued underlying. This approach ensures that the total exercisable value of the contract remains consistent with its pre-split value. For example, if an option was exercised at a strike price of $50 before a 1:10 split, the exercise value would be $5,000 (100 shares * $50). After the split, the new issued post-split SST option strike price will be $500. However, the adjusted “SST1” option maintains its original strike price (e.g., $50) and applies it to a value of 1/10 of the underlying, effectively preserving the $5,000 total value [^13].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;occ-adjustments-to-sst-option-deliverable-characteristics&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OCC Adjustments to SST Option Deliverable Characteristics&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company actions, particularly reverse stock splits, while crucial for a company’s finances, often have “unforeseen” impacts on the derivatives market, introducing significant inefficiencies. The creation of unique “post-split options” – characterized by low liquidity, complex pricing and trading – fragments this security&amp;rsquo;s option market. This fragmentation reduces overall market efficiency and can lead to wider bid-ask spreads and difficulty in price discovery. This situation reflects a trade-off between corporate governance needs (such as stock splits to meet listing requirements) and the expectation of a fully liquid and simple derivatives market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) plays a critical role in this process. Company actions fundamentally alter the nature of the underlying security. Without intervention, this would create material discrepancies and potentially unfair outcomes within derivative contracts. The OCC utilizes its regulatory authority and clearing corporation functions to adjust option terms. This ensures that the economic value of the options is preserved and that the market remains orderly and fair. This ongoing adjustment mechanism is crucial for maintaining overall market integrity and ensuring continuity of value for option holders as the underlying company evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-interactive-brokers-requires-sst-1&#34;&gt;Why Interactive Brokers Requires “SST 1”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;brokerage-handling-of-adjustment-post-expiration-option-symbols&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brokerage Handling of Adjustment Post-Expiration Option Symbols&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interactive Brokers (IB) as a leading brokerage firm, adheres explicitly to industry standards for option symbols. Their documentation confirms that IB “utilizes the 21-character ‘Options Symbol Initiative’ (OSI) format” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This commitment signifies their adherence to conventions established by Options Clearing Corporations (OCC) regarding the consolidation and processing of option symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IB also provides clients with mechanisms to understand and view potential impacts on their holdings stemming from company actions. Their Trader Workstation (TWS) and Messaging Center offer tools for monitoring company behavior and its impact on positions [^15].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of appending numerical suffixes (e.g., “1”) to original stock symbols to denote adjustment post-expiration is a common convention within the industry. This practice is often directly enforced by OCC to differentiate these contracts from newly issued, unadjusted underlying options related to company actions &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref8:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other brokerages also follow similar practices. For example, Robinhood explicitly states “If your holding of stock options experiences a reverse split,…the stock code will be appended with a number. For example, if you hold ABC options, after a reverse split, it will display as ABC1” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, Merrill Edge notes that an “A” (representing “Adjusted”) will appear alongside the symbol and that the symbol itself “will include an additional digit – representing the adjustment” [^13]. Questrade also mentions “A” icons or other special indicators [^14].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-suffix-as-an-industry-convention-for-distinguishing-contracts-after-adjustments&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“1” suffix as an industry convention for distinguishing contracts after adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symbol “SST1” is most directly and primarily due to official changes made by OCC. As detailed in OCC Information Memorandum #56689, following the 1-for-10 reverse stock split conducted by System1, Inc., the memorandum explicitly stated: “Option Symbol: SST changed to SST1” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref9:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is not an internal naming convention of IB, but rather a standardized industry protocol for identifying options contracts post-adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This convention is crucial because new, &lt;strong&gt;unadjusted&lt;/strong&gt; option series will be listed and begin trading on the underlying stock after reverse stock splits like those undertaken by companies. These new options will continue to use their original symbols (e.g., “SST”). To prevent confusion between these new standard contracts and older, adjusted contracts (where the underlying asset or effective exercise value relative to the post-split stock has been changed), adjusted contracts are assigned a modified symbol, such as “SST1” [^13].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the “SST1” symbol is a clear identifier indicating that the terms of the option contract have been amended by OCC to reflect System1, Inc.’s 1-for-10 reverse stock split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-does-this-convention-maintain-clarity-in-trading-systems-and-prevent-confusion&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this convention maintain clarity in trading systems and prevent confusion?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this unique symbol system, traders might inadvertently trade a “SST” option, mistakenly believing it represents the standard contract for 100 shares post-split. In reality, it would be an older, adjusted contract, potentially representing a different number of shares (e.g., effectively representing 10 shares post-split SST) or having a revalued strike price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using adjusted symbols like “SST1” ensures that trading systems, clearinghouses, and all market participants can accurately identify, price, process, and settle these contracts. This precision is crucial in preventing errors in order routing, pricing, exercise, and assignment, which could otherwise lead to significant financial discrepancies and disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this convention facilitates the simultaneous listing and trading of adjusted (legacy) options contracts and newly issued standard contracts on the same underlying security, with each contract identifiable by its unique symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-brokers-integrate-these-adjusted-symbols-into-their-platforms&#34;&gt;How Brokers Integrate These Adjusted Symbols into Their Platforms
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interactive Brokers, along with other brokers like Interactive Brokers, seamlessly integrates these OCC-mandated symbol changes into their trading platforms, including Trader Workstation (TWS). When corporate actions occur and the OCC publishes adjustments, IB updates the symbols for options contracts affected in client portfolios and option chains &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the underlying stock itself continues to use its original symbol (“SST”) for trading, existing adjusted option positions will be displayed with their new symbol (“SST1”).  For any order entry or queries related to these specific adjusted contracts, traders must use the “SST1” root symbol, which explains why users need to send “SST 1” to IB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a key observation: The underlying stock, System1, Inc., continues to use its original symbol “SST” for trading &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref3:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, for &lt;strong&gt;existing, adjusted option contracts&lt;/strong&gt;, the underlying root symbol within the option contract is “SST1” &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref10:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This creates a subtle situation where when trading &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; options (these options will be based on the split-adjusted “SST” stock going public), the underlying is “SST”; but when trading &lt;strong&gt;existing, adjusted&lt;/strong&gt; options, the underlying in the option symbol is “SST1”.  This is a nuanced yet crucial distinction that can easily confuse traders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon highlights a significant operational complexity within option trading, extending beyond simply understanding OSI formats. It underscores the need for continuous vigilance and a deep understanding of how corporate actions fragment the options market. Simply knowing the current stock code isn’t enough; traders must differentiate between the standard option on the underlying asset and its adjusted counterpart with a changed symbol. This further emphasizes the importance of carefully reviewing option chain details, company action notifications, and broker-specific guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation of adjusted option symbols (such as “SST1”) is clearly an &amp;ldquo;operational necessity&amp;rdquo; for exchanges and brokers. It’s a powerful mechanism to manage the complexity of corporate actions, maintain market integrity, and ensure accurate clearing and settlement &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref4:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, from the end-user perspective, this change can be a significant source of confusion, as evidenced by direct user queries. While brokers attempt to mitigate this confusion through visual indicators like an “A” icon 13 or automatic adjustments within client portfolios &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref4:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, potential complexities remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reveals the ongoing tension and trade-off between robust financial market infrastructure technical requirements and user-friendly interface demands.  While the “SST1” convention is efficient and necessary from a systems perspective, it places an additional burden on individual traders to understand its implications. This highlights the enduring value of expert analysis and detailed educational reports in bridging this knowledge gap, ensuring that market participants can effectively and confidently navigate these complexities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;impact-on-traders--best-practices&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Traders &amp;amp; Best Practices&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-identify-adjusted-options&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Identify Adjusted Options&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbol Suffixes:&lt;/strong&gt; The most direct and immediate indicator of adjusted options is the numerical suffix appended to the option root symbol (e.g., “1”, “7” for mini options, or other numbers) &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, seeing “SST1” instead of “SST” in an option held within System1, Inc. is a clear signal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Indicators on Trading Platforms:&lt;/strong&gt; Many well-known trading platforms, including Merrill Edge and Questrade, include specific visual cues. Traders should look for prominent “A” icons (representing “Adjusted”) or other special indicators alongside the option symbol in the option chain, quote window, or portfolio view [^13]. Interactive Brokers also uses icons (e.g., “C” representing company behavior) within its tax optimizer and messaging center to highlight affected positions [^15].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Liquidity:&lt;/strong&gt; A strong practical signal of an adjusted option is a significant decrease in trading volume and open interest compared to other options in the same series or newly issued, unlevered standard options based on the underlying asset [^13]. This activity reduction can lead to wider bid-ask spreads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discrepant Strike Prices:&lt;/strong&gt; Adjusted options may appear “out of whack” or inconsistent with other parts of the underlying stock option chain in terms of their strike prices [^13]. Furthermore, the presence of multiple put or call options with the same expiration date and strike price can indicate that an adjusted option is coexisting with newly issued standard options [^13].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing Anomalies:&lt;/strong&gt; If an option’s price appears unusually low or “priced incorrectly” (or vice versa – “too good to be true”), investigation is warranted, as an adjustment may have altered its intrinsic value or the deliverable asset [^13].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-importance-of-reviewing-occ-information-memorandums-and-broker-notices&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance of Reviewing OCC Information Memorandums and Broker Notices&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) is the final authority for determining and implementing adjustments to U.S. option contracts[^13]. Their “Information Memorandums” are the official and authoritative source for understanding the precise terms of any corporate action adjustment&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref11:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These memorandums provide key details regarding the deliverable (such as the number of shares per contract), strike prices, and changes in new option symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokers such as Interactive Brokers have a legal obligation and operational capability to notify their clients of upcoming corporate actions that may impact their positions. These notices are typically available through client messaging centers, corporate action tools, or platform alerts[^15]. They provide information on how the broker will process adjustments within its systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying solely on visual cues or general understanding of corporate actions may be insufficient and can lead to costly misunderstandings. To ensure accurate position management and trading decisions, it is essential to review these official and broker-specific sources to determine the precise adjustment terms (such as cash in lieu of fractional shares, specific deliverable changes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;post-adjustment-option-considerations&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Adjustment Option Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant Reduction in Liquidity:&lt;/strong&gt; The most significant impact of post-adjustment options is a severe reduction in liquidity[^13]. This typically leads to wider bid-ask spreads, making it more difficult and costly to enter or exit positions at fair market prices. Traders may find it challenging to locate counterparties willing to transact at the desired order size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Pricing Complexity:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to changes in the deliverable asset, valuing post-adjustment options becomes more complex. Standard option pricing models (such as the Black-Scholes model) may not directly apply unless carefully manual adjustments are made to account for the new number of shares or effective exercise prices. This complexity can lead to inefficient pricing and increase trader risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restricted Trading Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Certain brokerage platforms, such as Robinhood, may impose restrictions on trading post-adjustment options, typically limiting them to “only sell” positions&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref2:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This means traders can sell existing adjusted contracts but are prohibited from opening new positions, significantly restricting strategy flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambiguity Regarding Exercise/Settlement:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the exact deliverable asset at exercise or settlement is crucial. According to OCC’s specific adjustment terms, post-adjustment options may deliver a combination of shares, stock and cash, or even solely cash[^13]. Misunderstanding these terms can lead to unforeseen financial outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recommendations-for-options-traders&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for Options Traders&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactively Collect Information:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop a habit of regularly monitoring financial news media and your broker’s corporate actions section to understand any announcements regarding the underlying stocks held in your options positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Official Documentation:&lt;/strong&gt; Immediately upon learning of company action, consult relevant OCC information memorandums (available on the OCC website or through your broker&amp;rsquo;s resources) as well as your broker’s specific notices. These are the authoritative sources for understanding precise adjustment terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reassess Your Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Carefully evaluate how the adjustments affect the intrinsic value, breakeven points, and their role within your overall trading strategy for your specific option contracts. Determine if the adjusted contracts still align with your original investment thesis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider Position Management:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the inherent complexity and typical liquidity constraints, it’s generally advisable to consider exiting positions if the adjustments render your options positions no longer aligned with your trading objectives or if liquidity issues become unmanageable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor New Contracts:&lt;/strong&gt; As a best practice, avoid establishing new positions in adjusted option contracts. Instead, focus on newly issued standard option series on the underlying stock following company action, as these options typically offer better liquidity and more direct pricing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company actions have an impact on derivative markets, which is an inherent part of corporate finance; however, they often introduce significant inefficiencies. The creation of adjustments to options, with their lower liquidity and more complex pricing and trading dynamics (such as liquidity and pricing behavior), fragment the option market for a particular security. This fragmentation reduces overall market efficiency and can lead to wider bid-ask spreads and difficulty in price discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User queries perfectly illustrate that simply recognizing standard OSI format option symbols is insufficient when dealing with company actions. The seemingly minor “1” suffix (making it “SST1”) within the “SST” symbol – does not merely represent a superficial change; it foreshadows a series of fundamental changes to the contract terms, underlying asset, and market dynamics (such as liquidity, pricing behavior). This requires traders to go beyond simple symbol recognition and delve into the reasons behind these changes. This proactive research is an indispensable part of effective risk management and trading execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Option code “SST1G182500500.U” clearly indicates a tailored post-split option contract for System1, Inc. (SST). The key “SST1” root symbol was not arbitrarily assigned but is the direct result of an official adjustment enforced by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). This adjustment was necessary due to System1, Inc.’s 2025 June 12 effective one-for-ten reverse stock split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This corporate action fundamentally altered the underlying deliverable of existing option contracts. While the nominal contract multiplier remains at 100, the “SST1” reference symbol now represents that each contract effectively corresponds to 10 shares of the post-split SST stock, thereby preserving the original economic value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactive Brokers, like other major brokers, follows these OCC-enforced symbol conventions. By requiring the “SST1” (or “SST 1”) reference code, IB ensures accurate identification, processing, and display of these adjusted contracts within its trading systems, preventing potential errors and maintaining market integrity. The “G1825” and “.U” elements in user symbols may represent specific broker-defined or legacy expiration dates and internal identifiers, but they do not alter the fundamental reason for the “SST1” root symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any serious options trader, a thorough understanding of option symbols, particularly within this complex corporate context, is not just beneficial – it’s absolutely critical. Corporate actions can fundamentally change the terms, deliverable, and liquidity characteristics of outstanding option contracts, transforming them into “post-split option contracts” with unique symbols and trading behavior. Therefore, proactively monitoring company announcements, diligently reviewing official OCC information memoranda, and being acutely aware of broker-specific symbol conventions are essential best practices. These measures are crucial for accurately interpreting option contract terms, effectively managing risk exposures, and making informed strategic trading decisions in a dynamic market environment. Ignoring these key adjustments could lead to unforeseen financial consequences, operational complexities, and potentially significant losses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;AI has been integrated into daily development workflows, and recent investments have shifted focus from external funds to internal stocks and ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-source-projects&#34;&gt;Open Source Projects
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-log&#34;&gt;Project Log
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was bored and tried to obtain GitHub badges, starting to use the Issue module. Previously, when writing code, I always wanted to find a place to record the content of each AI modification, but creating a separate document to record it felt disorganized. Now that we have the Issue module, tagging them to distinguish between bugs, features, enhancements, etc., has made the records clear and efficient. Even if I might not need them in the future, recording them is still a form of accumulation.
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/comic-reader/issues?q=is%3Aissue&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;View Issue List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;release-notes&#34;&gt;Release Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Release record, find the most recent related commits. Since all commits are AI-generated, copy all recent commit records from the web interface and give them to AI to organize – this is a good release record.
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/comic-reader/releases/tag/v1.9.0&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/ttf248/comic-reader/releases/tag/v1.9.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;engagement&#34;&gt;Engagement
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That time it was featured on GitHub’s personal page, it passively increased the motivation to write code – after all, the data visualization made things quite fascinating. Even simple positive feedback could provide the impetus to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trae&#34;&gt;Trae
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paid for a monthly trial, honestly, it’s better in VSCode using Claude4. The practical effect is also better. Sometimes, even with the same problem, Trae gives better answers. Should I buy an annual subscription later? Given my current chaotic usage frequency, Trae might not be enough; don&amp;rsquo;t think about it too much, we’ll see when we run out. Byte should still have other paid plans and purchase more call volumes.
&lt;del&gt;Simple small issues can be solved using Microsoft, GitHub Copilot, and various models can also be called.&lt;/del&gt;
The plan is to fail – GitHub Copilot is now starting to limit the number of calls &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/zh/copilot/about-github-copilot/plans-for-github-copilot#models&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;618 opened restrictions&lt;/a&gt;

    &gt;current usage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investment&#34;&gt;Investment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I couldn’t resist. Since the Hong Kong Connect channel was opened, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t traded in the Hong Kong market, and I bought some Xiaomi stock thinking about their upcoming new car launch. It rose a bit, so I sold it, and when it fell, I bought it back again, repeating this process several times before the new car was released, making a small profit on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, I didn’t know what to do but look at the cross-border capital flows of Hong Kong Connect, watching Meituan&amp;rsquo;s net inflow of funds, and followed suit by buying it in, successfully becoming a shareholder, forgetting to look at the overall capital flow, only a part of the domestic purchases, and there were still many foreign investors in the Hong Kong market. This time it was just an opportunity to practice with blue-chip stocks, slowly holding on to the final gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling positions and losses are &lt;strong&gt;contrary to human nature&lt;/strong&gt;, slow down, slow down, don’t rush. If Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s new car doesn’t perform well, should I sell? That’s a question. My investment cognition is still insufficient, and I need to read more books and learn more. The Fed isn’t planning on cutting interest rates, and the Hong Kong market plunged once, if I missed the entry time? That wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be right, what if the news came out that interest rates were being cut and the Hong Kong market soared? This is investment, testing human nature.
&lt;code&gt;A phrase I often repeat: buying is for national fortune, but I don’t really believe in national fortune.&lt;/code&gt;
Aside from the belief in national fortune, &lt;strong&gt;another one is attention&lt;/strong&gt;. Since you&amp;rsquo;re going to do long-term investing, frequent monitoring of the market is pointless. Ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes at the close are enough. What is the final expected return rate? There’s still no clear stop-loss position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the market falls sharply, Tencent is a hot commodity, with capital flocking to it.

        <title>Cross-machine computation time difference</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cross-machine-computation-time-difference/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 09:45:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cross-machine-computation-time-difference/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The existing communication protocol within the group uses &lt;code&gt;steady_clock&lt;/code&gt; as a timestamp to calculate the latency for each individual node. In a specific scenario, a message packet’s built-in timestamp was used, and this timestamp originated from another machine – &lt;strong&gt;resulting in&lt;/strong&gt; an anomalous latency calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note: Gemini2.5 Pro shows promise of completely surpassing GPT-4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay attention to the issue with the base layer timestamp calculation at the beginning, so I just shut down all services and accessed locally to analyze the logs. I found that one service kept failing to stop, continuously sending business data, and there was nothing I could do. I used packet capture on the communication port to locate the machine&amp;rsquo;s position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo tcpdump -nni any -B 4096 -s 0 -w tmp.pcap port 13100
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal network situation was complex, and messages were being forwarded through proxies. First, I captured packets on port 13100 from the service&amp;rsquo;s local machine using &lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt;. Then, I switched to capturing packets on the proxy server on port 13100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis revealed that requests with excessive latency originated from the Shenzhen office. When troubleshooting the affected services, they were deployed in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;steady-clock-and-system-clock-differences&#34;&gt;Steady Clock and System Clock Differences
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::steady_clock&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;std::system_clock&lt;/code&gt; are the two primary clocks in C++ for time handling. They have the following key differences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stdsystem_clock&#34;&gt;std::system_clock
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Represents &amp;ldquo;Wall Clock Time&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;: It represents the actual, real-world time within the system. This time is consistent with the time displayed by the operating system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can be Adjusted&lt;/strong&gt;: The time of this clock can be adjusted by a user or a system service (such as NTP Network Time Protocol) forward or backward. For example, if you manually modify the system time or the system synchronizes with a time server, the value of &lt;code&gt;system_clock&lt;/code&gt; will jump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Suitable for Measuring Time Intervals&lt;/strong&gt;: Because it can jump backward, using it to calculate the difference between two time points may result in a negative number or inaccurate results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Use&lt;/strong&gt;: To obtain the current calendar time, used in scenarios where it needs to correspond to real-world time (e.g., logging timestamp).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stdsteady_clock&#34;&gt;std::steady_clock
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monotonic Clock:&lt;/strong&gt; This clock starts from a certain point and will only steadily move forward, never decreasing. Its rate may be fixed or not (although it&amp;rsquo;s usually fixed).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unadjustable:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;steady_clock&lt;/code&gt; is unaffected by system time changes. Even if the user modifies the system time, it will continue to advance steadily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Measuring Time Intervals:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to its monotonicity, it’s the best choice for measuring code execution time, timeout waits, etc., ensuring accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncertain Startpoint:&lt;/strong&gt; Its starting point (epoch) is typically when the system starts, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed by the standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-steady_clock-values-the-same-across-different-machines&#34;&gt;Are &lt;code&gt;steady_clock&lt;/code&gt; values the same across different machines?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No.&lt;/strong&gt;
The value of &lt;code&gt;steady_clock&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;not comparable&lt;/strong&gt; between different machines. Even between two different startup instances on the same machine, its value is not comparable.
This is because it was designed to precisely measure a time interval &lt;strong&gt;during a single program execution&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than representing an absolute point in time. Its epoch (start) is undefined and is almost always different across systems or different startup sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

        <title>Breadcrumb Navigation</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/breadcrumb-navigation/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 14 Jun 2025 23:34:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/breadcrumb-navigation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing AI&amp;rsquo;s random writing, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/comic-reader&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Local Comic Browser&lt;/a&gt;, at the end, I discovered there was no return to homepage function; I extracted the issue and fed it to AI. The solution was to add &lt;strong&gt;breadcrumb navigation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-breadcrumb-navigation&#34;&gt;What is Breadcrumb Navigation?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breadcrumb navigation is a common user interface design pattern typically used to help users understand their location within a website or application and provide quick paths to return to the previous level or homepage. Its name originates from the fairy tale &lt;em&gt;Hansel and Gretel&lt;/em&gt;, where the protagonists used breadcrumbs to mark their path home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical applications, breadcrumb navigation is usually presented in a hierarchical path format, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;Homepage &amp;gt; Category &amp;gt; Subcategory &amp;gt; Current Page
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This navigation method not only improves user experience but also helps users quickly locate and jump to specific content, especially within deep, hierarchical content structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-other-navigation-schemes-exist-besides-breadcrumbs&#34;&gt;What other navigation schemes exist besides breadcrumbs?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While breadcrumb navigation is a good option, there are several other common navigation solutions depending on the different application scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;back-button&#34;&gt;Back Button
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest and most direct solution, typically placed in the top of the page or toolbar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;← Return  or  ⬅ Back
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;: Simple and clear, low cognitive cost for users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;: Can only return to the previous level, cannot directly jump to higher levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;navigation-bar&#34;&gt;Navigation Bar
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixed navigation menu located at the top or side of a page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;Home | Categories | Settings | About
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Always visible, allowing direct jumps to any major page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Occupies screen space, may need to be collapsed on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sidebar&#34;&gt;Sidebar
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically displayed on the left or right side of a page to show a hierarchical structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;📁 Home
├── 📂 Anime
│   ├── 📖 One Piece
│   └── 📖 Naruto
└── 📂 Settings
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Clearly displays the complete structure, supports multi-level navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Occupies significant screen space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;floating-action-button&#34;&gt;Floating Action Button
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A floating action button is typically a circular, floating button that’s fixed to a specific location on the screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;🏠 (Floating in the bottom right corner)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;: Doesn&amp;rsquo;t occupy layout space, always accessible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;: Single function, may obscure content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gesture-navigation&#34;&gt;Gesture Navigation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigate using hand gestures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;Swipe right to go back one level
Double tap to return to the homepage
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt; Smooth operation, aligns with mobile usage habits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt; High learning curve, poor discoverability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-choose-the-right-navigation-scheme&#34;&gt;How to Choose the Right Navigation Scheme?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When selecting a navigation scheme, consider the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application Type:&lt;/strong&gt; Desktop application, web application, or mobile application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Group:&lt;/strong&gt; Technical proficiency, usage habits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Hierarchy:&lt;/strong&gt; Depth of hierarchy, structural complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen Space:&lt;/strong&gt; Available space size, layout restrictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage Frequency:&lt;/strong&gt; Frequency of navigation feature use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For scenarios like a local comic browser, it’s recommended to combine schemes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Scheme:&lt;/strong&gt; Breadcrumb Navigation (clearly displays the path)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auxiliary Schemes:&lt;/strong&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts (improves efficiency) + Floating Home Page Button (quickly returns to the starting point)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, you can meet the habits of different users while providing a convenient navigation experience in various scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WeChat Backup Tool Local Network Recognition Failed</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wechat-backup-tool-local-network-recognition-failed/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 23:04:42 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wechat-backup-tool-local-network-recognition-failed/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I regularly clear out data on my phone, including photos and WeChat chat logs, backing them up to my computer. Previously, it worked seamlessly, allowing me to easily identify both my mobile phone and desktop PC within the same local network and directly back up the chat records to my computer. However, today everything has been failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tried-solutions&#34;&gt;Tried Solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer connected to WIFI, phone connected to WIFI, both devices are within the same local network, but still cannot be recognized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone turned on hotspot, computer connected to phone hotspot, still cannot be recognized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions&#34;&gt;Solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desktops use a wired network, mobile phones use a wireless network, and when restoring WeChat backups, it cannot recognize this as a local area network. I have tested it, and the desktop can normally access the mobile phone&amp;rsquo;s IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions-1&#34;&gt;Solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought it was something from Tencent, so I asked “Junhun,” to see if he had any ideas. The results he provided were not helpful. I casually tossed it over to “Dubao,” and he offered a surprise – prompting me to realize that my local environment might have many virtual networks or multi-NIC environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was indeed correct; my desktop has several virtual network cards, such as VMware, ZeroTier, Hyper-V, and Docker Desktop. My desktop also has multiple physical network cards, the primary network card connected to the router and a 2.5G network card forming a sub-local network for another machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I disabled all virtual network cards and extra physical network cards on my desktop, retaining the primary network card, and reattempted the backup – it was successful!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>What is a Stablecoin?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/what-is-a-stablecoin/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 23:43:19 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/what-is-a-stablecoin/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins have already gained legal status in the United States and Hong Kong. This allows for more efficient capital flows globally, and gray areas are bound to exist if not regulated – similar to how the US manages opioid addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins are crypto assets pegged to fiat currencies (such as the US dollar or Hong Kong dollar) or precious metals, designed to maintain their value stability. They are primarily divided into three categories: fiat-backed (such as USDT, USDC), commodity-backed (like stablecoins backed by gold reserves), and algorithmic (which do not rely on physical reserves but instead use algorithms to maintain their peg)([zh.wikipedia.org][1])&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-why-should-legislation-support-stablecoins&#34;&gt;🛠️ Why Should Legislation Support Stablecoins?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-enhance-payment-efficiency-and-reduce-costs&#34;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Enhance Payment Efficiency and Reduce Costs&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins can provide instant, low-cost cross-border payment services, particularly in areas where banks are not covered. Their settlement speed is fast, fees are low, and they offer significant value for international trade and remittances ([ft.com][2]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-strengthening-the-internationalization-of-the-us-dollar--currency&#34;&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Strengthening the Internationalization of the US Dollar / Currency&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an American perspective, the rise of stablecoins can increase demand for short-term assets like U.S. Treasuries, thereby solidifying the dollar’s position and simultaneously driving financial innovation. The EU is also taking advantage of this opportunity to accelerate the launch of a digital euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-addressing-regulatory-gaps-and-mitigating-risks&#34;&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Addressing Regulatory Gaps and Mitigating Risks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, stablecoins have largely operated in the “shadow financial” system, lacking transparency and plagued by market irregularities, even involving risks such as money laundering and fraud. The U.S. proposed STABLE Act and GENIUS Act require clear regulation, disclosure of reserves, and capital/liquidation rules to ensure financial security and investor protection ([morganlewis.com][3]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong, meanwhile, has begun implementing the “Stablecoins Ordinance” from August 2025, requiring stablecoin issuers to obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and meet standards for reserves, redemptions, and anti-money laundering (AML/CFT), as well as prohibiting unlicensed institutions from advertising promotions ([morganlewis.com][4]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-stablecoin-companies-make-money&#34;&gt;How Do Stablecoin Companies Make Money?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest Income on Reserve Assets&lt;/strong&gt;
For example, Circle’s USDC reserves are largely held in short-term US Treasury bonds, benefiting from current interest rates. In 2023, profits increased significantly, and approximately $5 billion in profit was projected for 2025 (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ft.com/content/eb588992-ece3-4254-b2ea-721a20bf1180?utm_source=chatgpt.com&#34;  title=&#34;Lessons from a stablecoin IPO: tech turns on a dime&#34;
     target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ft.com&lt;/a&gt;) . Tether’s report showed earnings of $5.2 billion in the first half of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transaction Fees and Developer Tool Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;
In addition to minting/redemption fees, stablecoin platforms generate stable revenue by providing APIs, SDKs, settlement tools, etc., for DeFi, wallets, and corporate clients (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stablecoin-supply-is-growing-fast-heres-how-it-compares-to-cash-66f12bc1?utm_source=chatgpt.com&#34;  title=&#34;Stablecoin supply is growing fast. Here&amp;#39;s how it compares to cash.&#34;
     target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;marketwatch.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Expansion Services&lt;/strong&gt;
Some stablecoin issuers profit through additional products (such as interest redemption, investment features, corporate settlements, etc.), but this may lead to regulatory restrictions on “interest-bearing stablecoins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-summary&#34;&gt;✅ Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; are payment tools designed to mitigate the volatility of cryptocurrencies, maintaining value through reserves or algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory legislation&lt;/strong&gt; aims to promote compliance, protect consumers, maintain financial stability, and foster innovation and international competitiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue models&lt;/strong&gt; primarily derive from interest on reserve assets, fees, and value-added services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, if regulated effectively, stablecoins could play a significant role in global payment systems and compete with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>- Four people in a university dormitory, and ten years later they went in four different directions.</title>

        <pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 21:37:30 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/university-dormitory-four-people-ten-years-later-they-went-in-four-different-directions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lightstone debuted today, and a former roommate from university has been working inside for many years, leading the hardware development of a particular product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding expertise, Lightstone’s core business is sports cameras, which is most closely related to his undergraduate major: &lt;strong&gt;Automation&lt;/strong&gt;. Automation is a broad field; during his sophomore year, it was divided into smaller specializations. Regarding his former roommate, there were two groups – the first group were freshman roommates, and the second group were sophomore roommates, who were re-assigned when the majors were split up. Our specialization covers embedded systems, engineering automation control, and circuit design—basically a very diverse range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating from university, four people went in four different directions. Although they were all majoring in automation, each person’s choice was unique. It happened to be a fortunate coincidence that the four roommates – myself and three others – had briefly reunited in Shenzhen for two years. I was assigned to the Shenzhen branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myself&lt;/strong&gt; As I&amp;rsquo;ve written in previous articles, I started working in financial IT immediately after graduation, always focusing on Hong Kong and US stocks. The related business content updates on the site are relatively infrequent. To put it another way, while I understand the business and have some knowledge of it, it’s not deep enough. I’ve consistently done transactional-related work, and later expanded to maintaining and monitoring system bottom-layer communications, doing a lot of miscellaneous tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roommate A&lt;/strong&gt; It seems he started in Ningbo, working on HVAC hardware sales, then moved to Shenzhen. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the details of his previous jobs, but he jumped to ZTE once, leaving during his probation period before it even ended, and then worked at Yijing Technology for several years, leading the R&amp;amp;D of a certain sports camera’s hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roommate B&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know his background experiences, currently involved in automotive hardware R&amp;amp;D in Wuhan, having done so for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roommate C&lt;/strong&gt; Currently working at Vanke in Shenzhen, doing construction supervision for real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-choices&#34;&gt;Life Choices
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not really sure about the regrets of the other two, as we haven&amp;rsquo;t been in much contact – the last time I spoke to them was when they were leaving Shenzhen. We had a chaotic dinner with three “idiots” (a playful term) for our friend from Wuhan, and I made him a video call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back during university, several of us always said, &amp;ldquo;I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have gone into automation; I should have gone straight to the computer science department. I really loved writing code here, and we won’t go into detail about why I didn’t choose computer science – I’ve written about it in previous articles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I’m this age, money is an unavoidable topic. When I left Shenzhen, it was because of the high housing prices, with the intention of settling down in Hangzhou. Due to a lucky coincidence, I never settled in Hangzhou and instead worked in Shanghai for income. It was fortunate that I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy a property at a high level when Hangzhou’s houses were being absorbed. When I left Shenzhen, it coincided with the hottest period for Chinese-American stocks. I jumped from one company to another and received a salary increase, but lacked clear industry understanding: &lt;strong&gt;domestic lead flow is a gray area, with policy risks.&lt;/strong&gt; Simply put, I circumvented the Hong Kong Connect and traded directly in Hong Kong and American stocks. In 2021, the government abruptly shut down domestic lead flow, causing Chinese brokerage firms to transform and their Hong Kong and American stock businesses to shrink significantly. Basically, in finance, you must comply with regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the reason for writing this article, Jieson Group surged dramatically – &lt;strong&gt;270%&lt;/strong&gt; – leading to an offer from within the company to subscribe. The specific amount here is not discussed. I can only say that Roommate A’s down payment on a house in Shenzhen was likely secured. Although we didn&amp;rsquo;t delve deeply into this subscription matter, I was also tempted to subscribe through his channels, but the scale of the investment was too large and I couldn’t handle the risk. Ultimately, Roommate A chose a safer subscription scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have much capital, so we can’t withstand large losses; even if we could endure it, what good would it do to throw in fifty and try our luck? This kind of opportunity might not come around again in a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-choices-1&#34;&gt;Life Choices
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To say I haven’t made any money in the past ten years is a lie – I do occasionally envy those who make more, and this decade has been happy because I&amp;rsquo;ve done what I wanted to do, without experiencing any workplace bullying or manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real estate inevitably brings up the topic of money; after all, a 30% down payment is sitting there, and whether you can make money depends not only on your effort but also on the industry’s cycle and whether it can trend upwards. That would have been an opportunity to invest in Jushi (影石), as they were early on, focusing on overseas products while their domestic reputation was still lacking. The circle of Hong Kong-American stocks had become accustomed to a relaxed lifestyle, and I&amp;rsquo;d essentially given back most of my specialized skills to the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a rambling mess; it’s hard for young people to understand an entire industry, let alone formulate ten-year career plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;going-global-with-products&#34;&gt;Going Global with Products
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make money in foreign trade, the same products can sell for 1,000 RMB domestically, 3,000 RMB abroad, and even more. Considering the current intense price competition within China, it’s even more advantageous. Jingjie (JingShi) and DJI have already started focusing on the panoramic camera sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Jingjie and DJI, aside from leveraging the advantages of the Shenzhen industrial chain, product going global is also a crucial factor. The domestic market is fiercely competitive with severe price wars, while foreign markets offer higher prices and larger profit margins, making it easier to survive in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Memory Layout and Binary Compatibility</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/memory-layout-and-binary-compatibility/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 18:53:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/memory-layout-and-binary-compatibility/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;C++ service crashed. The service depends on a static library for compilation.
The static library made modifications, adding members to the header file and re-publishing the binary static library file.
The service relies on the new binary library file, compiles and runs normally, but then crashes. The crash point appears fine, similar to the crashes caused by compiler upgrades – undefined behavior, an untrustworthy stack trace.
Updating the service’s dependent header files allows it to mutate correctly, and running also works normally.
A detailed explanation is needed, involving computer science knowledge, I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s related to memory layout, with examples for a thorough explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a typical crash caused by mismatches between static library header files and binary library files. It’s indeed related to memory layout. Here’s a detailed explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-analysis&#34;&gt;Problem Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Static libraries’ header files define the structure of classes (including member variables and methods), while their binary files contain the implementation code. During compilation, the compiler generates code based on the class definitions in the header files, including memory layout and access patterns. If the header file and the static library&amp;rsquo;s binary file are not compatible, it can lead to undefined behavior at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-concepts&#34;&gt;Key Concepts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Layout:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In C++, the layout of class member variables in memory is determined by the compiler based on the header file definition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a header file adds member variables, the memory layout of the class will change. For example, adding a new member variable may increase the size ( &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt; ) of the class or change the offset of the member variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binary Compatibility:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static library binary files are generated based on the header files. If a service is compiled using older header files and links to a new static library binary at runtime, the service&amp;rsquo;s code will access class member variables according to the old memory layout, while the implementation code of the static library operates on the new memory layout. This inconsistency leads to undefined behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undefined Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undefined behavior may manifest as crashes, incorrect stack traces, or even abnormal program execution results. This is because when the program accesses memory, it may access an incorrect address or an uninitialized region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;examples&#34;&gt;Examples
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a static library whose header file originally defined the following class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;class MyClass {
public:
    int a;
    void func();
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binary file of the static library is compiled based on this definition.
Later, the header file was modified to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;class MyClass {
public:
    int a;
    int b;  // Added member variable
    void func();
};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new static library binary file is compiled based on the modified header file.
If the service compiles using the old header file, the following problems may occur:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inconsistent Memory Layout:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The service assumes that &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s size is &lt;code&gt;sizeof(int)&lt;/code&gt;, while the static library assumes it’s &lt;code&gt;sizeof(int) * 2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When accessing members of the &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; object, the service may access an incorrect memory address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method Call Issues:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the implementation code in the static library depends on the new member variable (e.g., &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;), and the service&amp;rsquo;s code does not correctly initialize &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, a crash may occur at runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions&#34;&gt;Solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain Consistency Between Header Files and Binary Files:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During service compilation, ensure you are using header files that match the binary file of the static library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Incompatible Modifications to Binaries:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When modifying class definitions, try to avoid directly adding member variables; instead, use inheritance or other methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recompile All Dependent Components:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a static library is modified, recompile all services that depend on it to ensure consistency between the header files and binary files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The root cause of this issue is inconsistency between the header file and binary file, leading to errors in memory layout. The C++ compiler generates code based on the header file during compilation, while runtime behavior depends on the binary file. If these two don&amp;rsquo;t match, it results in undefined behavior. Ensuring consistency between the header file and binary file can prevent similar problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>2025 Major Events</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/2025-major-events/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 23:36:01 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/2025-major-events/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Record some scattered thoughts and fragments, so as not to need to write them up separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by friends, I also wanted to create a similar sharing page, and &lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt; has already been developed. However, the homepage display and historical data processing all have minor issues, which led me to think about creating an annual article to achieve a similar effect, and subsequently &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; was developed to implement the article pinning function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;february-2025&#34;&gt;February 2025
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;deepseek-goes-viral&#34;&gt;DeepSeek Goes Viral
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 2025-02-07&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the eve of Chinese New Year, DeepSeek had become a hot topic, attracting widespread attention on social media in just a few days. This sudden surge in popularity was surprising and triggered a chain reaction in the market. Meanwhile, NVIDIA’s stock plummeted, raising concerns among many investors, who conducted large-scale short selling during this period, seemingly pointing to a “carefully orchestrated” situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-of-political-elements-in-films-during-the-spring-festival&#34;&gt;Analysis of Political Elements in Films During the Spring Festival
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 2025-02-10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I went to the Spring Festival film release for the crowds, and this time I watched two movies that felt quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the new changes in 2025&amp;rsquo;s Spring Festival films, focusing on &lt;em&gt;Shanghai Detective 1900&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nezha: The Devil’s Child&lt;/em&gt;. The former utilizes the backdrop of San Francisco Chinatown in 1900 to depict the discrimination and oppression faced by Chinese people, reflecting the social and political environment. The latter, as an animated film, employs rich metaphorical elements to subtly criticize the current international political landscape – such as the resemblance of Yu Huang Palace to the Pentagon mirroring the American political system, the dollar symbol on the Tian Yuan Ding symbolizing U.S. dollar hegemony, the jade amulet resembling an American green card representing status levels, and the Soul-Destroying Potion like a biochemical weapon reflecting malicious actions. Both films offer a new viewing experience and prompt reflection on the relationship between cinematic art and political expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;online-vs-offline-movie-ticket-price-differences-were-astonishing&#34;&gt;Online vs. Offline Movie Ticket Price Differences Were Astonishing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 2025-02-11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Spring Festival, a family of seven or eight people wanted to see a movie and initially planned to purchase tickets on platforms like Tao Piao Piao and Maoyan. They saw prices of 60 yuan. Luckily, they had a cinema recharge card, which required them to buy tickets at the cinema&amp;rsquo;s front desk, so they asked the staff if there were any discounts available. Surprisingly, the same showtime cost only 35 yuan when purchased directly at the front desk – this price difference was truly astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nezha-goes-viral&#34;&gt;Nezha Goes Viral
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 2025-02-15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosive popularity of Nezha during the Spring Festival box office has evoked a strange sense of national pride, reminiscent of films like &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; and patriotic themes. While there’s been significant progress, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t reached this level. As gamers, many aspects feel overly greasy, and the combat scenes heavily resemble those found in online games. There are already numerous reports of people buying movie tickets for Nezha but not watching the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;march-2025&#34;&gt;March 2025
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;trump-administration-imposes-tariffs-triggering-trade-turmoil&#34;&gt;Trump Administration Imposes Tariffs, Triggering Trade Turmoil
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 2025-03-04&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, triggering significant volatility in the North American trade chain. Canada announced retaliatory measures against U.S. goods worth $15.5 billion, while Mexico accelerated its signing of a free trade agreement with China to mitigate risks. This led to further diversification of global supply chains, presenting a window for Chinese steel companies to capitalize on domestic substitution of high-end steel materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;may-2025&#34;&gt;May 2025
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tiangong-and-dong-xiyi-effect-a-butterfly-phenomenon&#34;&gt;The Tiangong and Dong Xiyi Effect: A Butterfly Phenomenon
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date:&lt;/strong&gt; 2025-05-07&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Peking Union Medical College “4+4” Project (4 years of non-medical undergraduate + 4 years of medical doctorate) focuses on interdisciplinary elite cultivation. In 2025, the Dong Xiyi incident exposed its use of family background (medical/scientific research lineage) to enter the project, with questions regarding the validity of its degrees and allegations of plagiarism in her thesis, exposing contradictions between its elite recruitment model and fairness, as well as unresolved issues surrounding shortened study periods and internship training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some say it’s a corner of Tiangong (the Space Palace), others claim it&amp;rsquo;s a case of class decline. Dong Xiyi didn’t need to be a doctor; it was her family’s unwillingness to settle for a life less than their own that led her to pursue the Peking Union College 4+4 project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;special-teacher-recruitment--a-sudden-decline&#34;&gt;Special Teacher Recruitment – A Sudden Decline
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 2025-05-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruitment of special teachers in Jiangxi Province has shown a significant reduction trend from 2020-2025: the number of special teacher recruits plummeted from 6,617 to just 32 (a decrease of 99.5%), while the number of national cadre teachers decreased from 11,324 to 2,146 (a decrease of 81.1%). The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, Mathematics, and English) remained stable but declined in total numbers, while the proportions of music, art, and physical education increased but in limited absolute quantities (e.g., in 2025, they only recruited 2 people each). Policy changes have implemented “retire one, replenish one” personnel adjustments to tighten teacher resources, which are being directed towards vocational training and remote areas, leading to a significant reduction in traditional primary and secondary school positions. In 2025, some subjects planned for recruitment were zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-trade-war-suddenly-paused&#34;&gt;The Trade War Suddenly Paused
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 2025-05-12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade war tariffs have followed a “escalation – retaliation – negotiation” cycle, with the US-China rivalry shifting from tariff confrontation to competition over rules. Although the short-term easing has alleviated market pressure, long-term uncertainty remains, and it’s crucial to monitor WTO rulings, supply chain adjustments, and geopolitical changes&amp;rsquo; sustained impact on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals aren’t making money beyond their own expectations; the stock market crash triggered by the initial trade war this year is now largely recovered, although countless small investors have been buried along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;june-2025&#34;&gt;June 2025
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;super-hot-susuper-public-sports-economic-value-emerges&#34;&gt;Super Hot SuSuper: Public Sports Economic Value Emerges
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 2025-06-09&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jiangsu Super League (SuSuper) third round of matches saw an average attendance of over 10,000 people, with the “Chu Han Clash” match in Xuzhou Olympic Center drawing 22,198 spectators, breaking the record for amateur events in China. Short videos on platforms like Douyin created buzz and drove cross-city consumption for over 180,000 people, boosting hotel occupancy rates by 20%-30%. Innovative sports commercialization models saw a surge in brand exposure for sponsors such as Jiangsu Bank and Jinshilu, validating the multiplier effect of “Sports + Tourism.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 18:46:55 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/102435268-also-belongs-to-the-local-area-network/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the previous discussion, today we’ll be talking about local area network IP addresses. Last time, in order to synchronize code, the server configured a proxy, and the server and the desktop computer in the house were able to connect to the network. Within a local area network, the proxy program was deployed on the desktop, and the server accessed the internet through the proxy. Code synchronization was very slow, so it was abandoned. Half a month later, when verifying the code on the server, the &lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt; code synchronization failed with a network error. Without much thought, I examined the error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;incident-scene&#34;&gt;Incident Scene
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fatal: unable to access &amp;lsquo;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cnb.cool/ttf248/learn/cpp.git/%27&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://cnb.cool/ttf248/learn/cpp.git/’&lt;/a&gt;: Failed to connect to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://10.243.52.68&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;10.243.52.68&lt;/a&gt; port 7897 after 7 ms: Couldn’t connect to server&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;incident-scene-1&#34;&gt;Incident Scene
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, they assumed that there was no network isolation between Alibaba Cloud services and the Tencent Cloud Native Development Platform, leading to code synchronization failures and error messages being thrown into the group. Smart people in the group saw the port information and said, &amp;ldquo;Is this a proxy IP? Then immediately someone said, &amp;lsquo;You&amp;rsquo;re using a local network, and the domain name resolution is incorrect,&amp;rsquo; and it was in the midst of memory loss, completely forgetting that they had configured a proxy.&amp;rdquo;
Seeing the word &lt;strong&gt;local network&lt;/strong&gt;, their brains returned to normal, and they remembered configuring the proxy. The error address was the local network address of their home desktop computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habitual thinking: 192.168.x.x is a local network address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In computer networking, a &lt;strong&gt;Local Area Network (LAN) IP address&lt;/strong&gt; refers to a private IP address used within a local network. These addresses are not directly exposed on the public internet and are primarily used for internal device communication. The &lt;code&gt;10.243.52.68&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;192.168.x.x&lt;/code&gt; you mentioned both belong to &lt;strong&gt;private IP address ranges&lt;/strong&gt;, but they belong to different address ranges, and their application scenarios and logical planning also differ. Here&amp;rsquo;s a detailed comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;private-ip-address-classification-and-ranges&#34;&gt;Private IP Address Classification and Ranges
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc1918/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;RFC 1918&lt;/a&gt;, private IP addresses are divided into three ranges, each suitable for different sizes of local area networks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| &lt;strong&gt;10.0.0.0/8&lt;/strong&gt; | 255.0.0.0 | Approximately 16 million | Large enterprises, campus networks |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;private-ip-address-classification-and-ranges-1&#34;&gt;Private IP Address Classification and Ranges
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Address Range&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Subnet Mask&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Number of Available IPs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Application Scenario&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;172.16.0.0/12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255.240.0.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Approximately 1 Million&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Medium-sized Enterprise Networks&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;private-ip-address-classification-and-ranges-2&#34;&gt;Private IP Address Classification and Ranges
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Address Range&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Subnet Mask&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Number of Available IPs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Application Scenario&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;192.168.0.0/16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255.255.0.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Approximately 65,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Small Local Networks (Home, Office)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ip-address-resolution-in-your-query&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IP Address Resolution in Your Query:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;10.243.52.68&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
Belongs to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;10.0.0.0/8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; range, a typical address for large private networks, often used in enterprise local area networks or wide area networks (such as internal networks across multiple branches).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;192.168.x.x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
Belongs to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;192.168.0.0/16&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; range, the most common address for small private networks, widely used in home routers and small offices etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-differences&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Differences&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;address-space-size&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address Space Size&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;10.0.0.0/8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:
The address range of the subnet is &lt;code&gt;10.0.0.0 ~ 10.255.255.255&lt;/code&gt;, containing &lt;strong&gt;16,777,216 available IP addresses&lt;/strong&gt;, suitable for large networks (such as enterprises, schools, and data centers) that require a large number of IP addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;192.168.0.0/16&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:
The address range is &lt;code&gt;192.168.0.0 ~ 192.168.255.255&lt;/code&gt;, containing only &lt;strong&gt;65,536 available IP addresses&lt;/strong&gt;, suitable for small networks with a low number of devices (such as home networks typically having fewer than fifty devices).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;subnetting-flexibility&#34;&gt;Subnetting Flexibility
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;10.0.0.0/8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to the large address space, it can be further divided into multiple subnets (such as &lt;code&gt;10.1.0.0/16&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;10.2.0.0/16&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) using a &lt;strong&gt;subnet mask&lt;/strong&gt; for layered network management and traffic isolation in larger networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;192.168.0.0/16&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Typically uses the default subnet mask &lt;code&gt;255.255.0.0&lt;/code&gt;; subnetting requirements are less frequent, suitable for simple flat network structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;common-use-cases&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Use Cases&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;10.xxx.xxx.xxx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise Internal Networks: such as multiple branches of multinational companies connected via VPN, each branch can be assigned a separate subnet (e.g., &lt;code&gt;10.1.1.0/24&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;10.1.2.0/24&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Service Provider Internal Networks: private cloud environments like AWS and Alibaba Cloud often use the &lt;code&gt;10.&lt;/code&gt; address range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industrial Control Networks: some industrial equipment defaults to using the &lt;code&gt;10.&lt;/code&gt; address range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;192.168.xxx.xxx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home/Small Office: default addresses assigned by routers (e.g., &lt;code&gt;192.168.1.1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;192.168.0.1&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small Local Area Networks for Sharing: such as WiFi networks built through a router, the number of devices is typically less than 200.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;network-isolation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Isolation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are private addresses and &lt;strong&gt;cannot be directly accessed from the public internet&lt;/strong&gt;. They require a connection to the public network via &lt;strong&gt;NAT (Network Address Translation)&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;VPN&lt;/strong&gt;. However, in practical usage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;10.&lt;/code&gt; segment is commonly used for scenarios requiring more complex network architectures (such as subnets and VLAN segmentation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;192.168.&lt;/code&gt; segment is preferred due to its smaller address space, making it suitable for plug-and-play simple networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-are-you-seeing-addresses-in-the-10-segment&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are you seeing addresses in the &lt;code&gt;10.&lt;/code&gt; segment?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you encounter addresses like &lt;code&gt;10.243.52.68&lt;/code&gt; on your local network, possible reasons include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise Network Environment:&lt;/strong&gt;
Your company or organization may use the &lt;code&gt;10.&lt;/code&gt; segment as an internal IP address to differentiate between departments or devices (such as servers and office computers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual Machine or Container Networks:&lt;/strong&gt;
Cloud platforms (like VMware, Docker) often default to using the &lt;code&gt;10.&lt;/code&gt; segment for assigning IP addresses to virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Device Default Configuration:&lt;/strong&gt;
Some network devices (such as industrial switches and firewalls) may be pre-configured with the &lt;code&gt;10.&lt;/code&gt; segment by the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-how-to-choose&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: How to Choose?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Networks (Home/Office):&lt;/strong&gt; Prioritize &lt;code&gt;192.168.x.x&lt;/code&gt;, simple configuration and sufficient for use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medium to Large Networks (Enterprise/Campus):&lt;/strong&gt; Use &lt;code&gt;10.x.x.x&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;172.16.x.x&lt;/code&gt; for subnetting and managing a large number of devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are fundamentally local area network addresses, the difference lies in address space and applicable scenarios, with no technical superiority – it depends on the networking planning needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Git Single Configuration Proxy</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-single-configuration-proxy/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 18:29:46 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-single-configuration-proxy/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Accessing GitHub domestically is slow, and you can speed it up by configuring a proxy. There’s also another way: find a domestic hosting platform like CodeOcean or Coding. Configure the corresponding build pipeline to sync your code to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using ‘coding’ for many years – its interface is simple, and they recently released an announcement that the free version can no longer be used, requiring migration to Tencent’s new platform, &lt;code&gt;cnb&lt;/code&gt;.  Let me also complain a bit about Alibaba’s hosting platform; the entire interface design feels very dated/stuffy. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like eating a bowl of congee (班味 - ban wei)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cnb.cool/ttf248&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://cnb.cool/ttf248&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;repository-migration&#34;&gt;Repository Migration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;cnb&lt;/code&gt; website provides migration tools that can batch migrate code from &lt;code&gt;github&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;cnb&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.cnb.cool/zh/guide/migration-tools.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://docs.cnb.cool/zh/guide/migration-tools.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;git-proxy-configuration&#34;&gt;Git Proxy Configuration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid slow synchronization due to the lack of an accelerator, tools will first synchronize code to your local machine and then upload it to the remote repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git can be configured for HTTP proxies independently using the following commands, without affecting system-wide settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# Set HTTP proxy
git config --global http.proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080

# Set HTTPS proxy
git config --global https.proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080

# Optional: Configure proxy for a specific domain
git config --global http.https://github.com.proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remove the proxy configuration, use the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view your current proxy configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git config --global --get http.proxy
git config --global --get https.proxy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Prometheus Monitoring System Histogram and Summary</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/prometheus-monitoring-system-histogram-and-summary/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 19:00:28 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/prometheus-monitoring-system-histogram-and-summary/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Business systems designed monitoring metrics of type Summary, calculating the average duration: &lt;code&gt;request_duration_milliseconds_sum / request_duration_milliseconds_count&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the data, a particular interface was found to have very high average duration, and when examining the time series chart, the average duration suddenly increased – effectively, one request took a long time, which pulled up the overall average.  The goal was to identify exactly when this request occurred, but due to the low number of requests within the period, the data retrieved remained empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;qa&#34;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;-why-does-_sum-and-_count-have-data&#34;&gt;✅ Why does &lt;code&gt;_sum&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_count&lt;/code&gt; have data?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;_sum&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_count&lt;/code&gt; are the &lt;strong&gt;core metrics&lt;/strong&gt; of the Summary type, and Prometheus always collects and records these values;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are &lt;strong&gt;cumulative counters&lt;/strong&gt;, suitable for use with &lt;code&gt;rate()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;increase()&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regardless of request latency changes, as long as there are requests, &lt;code&gt;_sum&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_count&lt;/code&gt; will always have data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-why-quantile099-might-not-display-in-a-time-series-chart&#34;&gt;❌ Why &lt;code&gt;{quantile=&amp;quot;0.99&amp;quot;}&lt;/code&gt; might &lt;strong&gt;not display&lt;/strong&gt; in a Time Series Chart
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Summary is configured with &lt;code&gt;quantile=&amp;quot;0.99&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, this time series may not exist or be missing:
Metrics are definitely configured, and the data hasn&amp;rsquo;t expired. 📉 The request volume is too small, preventing quantile calculation, due to the sliding window mechanism; after this period of time, it will no longer be included in the statistical range.
Quantiles (such as p99) are calculated through sampling statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the request count over a certain period is too low (e.g., 1~2 requests), the calculation of p99 is &lt;strong&gt;unstable or lacks representativeness&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prometheus &lt;strong&gt;client SDK will choose not to expose this quantile time series&lt;/strong&gt; to avoid misleading;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, you&amp;rsquo;ll see &lt;code&gt;_sum&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;_count&lt;/code&gt; accumulating normally, but &lt;code&gt;quantile=&amp;quot;0.99&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; has no data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;histogram-and-summary-differences&#34;&gt;Histogram and Summary Differences
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;histogram&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Histogram&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it Works:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A histogram will bucket data, recording the number of samples falling into each bucket.
For example, if buckets are defined as &lt;code&gt;[10ms, 50ms, 100ms, 500ms, 1s]&lt;/code&gt;, each request latency would be assigned to the corresponding bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can aggregate data from multiple instances (e.g., multiple service node request latencies) in Prometheus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suitable for calculating percentiles (such as P50, P95, P99) and observing latency distributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides flexible querying capabilities, supporting dynamic percentile calculation through PromQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires predefining the bucket range; an inappropriate choice can lead to uneven data distribution (e.g., all requests falling into one bucket).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more buckets you have, the greater the storage and computational overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suitable Scenarios:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregating data from multiple instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamically adjusting percentiles or analyzing latency distributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it Works:&lt;/strong&gt;
The Summary component calculates percentiles (such as P50, P95, P99) directly on the client and reports the results to Prometheus.
It also records the total number and sum of samples for calculating averages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does not require predefined buckets, providing percentile results directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suitable for precise percentile calculations in single instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentile calculation is performed on the client side, preventing aggregation of data from multiple instances in Prometheus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjusting percentiles (e.g., changing from P95 to P99) requires modifying the code and redeploying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Cases:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single instance monitoring where precise percentile accuracy is a high priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When aggregation of data from multiple instances is not required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-difference-comparison&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Difference Comparison&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Depends on the number of buckets&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fixed overhead&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-differences-comparison-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Differences Comparison&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Histogram&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Summary&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;High (dynamically adjustable bins)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Low (requires code modification to adjust bins)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-1&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need to aggregate data from multiple instances or require flexible quantile adjustments, choose &lt;strong&gt;Histogram&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you only need the precise quantiles for a single instance and the quantiles are fixed, choose &lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your scenario, given that the service is distributed, it’s recommended to prioritize using &lt;strong&gt;Histogram&lt;/strong&gt; so that all instance data can be aggregated in Prometheus and dynamically calculate quantiles and distributions of latency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sliding-window-concept-and-its-relationship-with-histograms-and-summaries&#34;&gt;Sliding Window Concept and Its Relationship with Histograms and Summaries
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;sliding-window-concept&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sliding Window Concept&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sliding window is a time-windowing mechanism used to analyze changes in data over a period. It dynamically reflects the system&amp;rsquo;s real-time state by continuously moving a temporal range. The key characteristics of a sliding window are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed Time Range:&lt;/strong&gt; The length of the window is fixed, such as the last 1 minute or 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Time Updates:&lt;/strong&gt; As time passes, the window slides, old data is removed from the window, and new data is added to the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Uses:&lt;/strong&gt; Used for calculating real-time metrics (such as request rates, averages, percentiles, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Prometheus, sliding windows are typically implemented using query functions (like &lt;code&gt;rate()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;avg_over_time()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sliding-window-and-histogram-relationship&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sliding Window and Histogram Relationship&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Histogram Data Structure:&lt;/strong&gt;
A histogram will bin sample data and record the count for each bucket. Prometheus periodically scrapes these counts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sliding Window Implementation:&lt;/strong&gt;
In Prometheus, sliding windows can be applied to histogram data using query statements. For example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])&lt;/code&gt;: Calculates the request rate within each bucket over the past 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))&lt;/code&gt;: Calculates the 95th percentile of the request duration over the past 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sliding windows can dynamically reflect the recent request latency distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The binning mechanism of histograms combined with sliding windows allows for efficient calculation of percentiles and distributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sliding-window-and-summary-relationship&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sliding Window and Summary Relationship&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary Data Structure:&lt;/strong&gt;
Summary calculates percentiles directly on the client side and reports them to Prometheus. It also records the total sample count and sum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sliding Window Implementation:&lt;/strong&gt;
In Prometheus, sliding windows can be applied to Summary data using query statements. For example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) / rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m])&lt;/code&gt;: Calculates the average request duration over the past 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary percentiles are calculated on the client side and cannot be recalculated in Prometheus, therefore support for sliding windows with percentiles is limited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sliding windows cannot directly operate on Summary percentiles when aggregating data from multiple instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sliding-window-applicability&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sliding Window Applicability&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-time Monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Sliding windows are suitable for monitoring system real-time status, such as request rates over the last minute and latency distributions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anomaly Detection:&lt;/strong&gt;  By using a sliding window, it’s possible to quickly identify short-term anomalies (e.g., sudden increase in request latency).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Sliding windows can dynamically reflect changes in system trends rather than static global statistics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-2&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Histogram&lt;/strong&gt; combined with a sliding window can dynamically calculate percentiles (such as P95, P99) and request latency distributions, suitable for monitoring distributed systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt; combined with a sliding window can calculate simple metrics such as averages, but lacks flexibility regarding percentiles and does not support multi-instance aggregation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your scenario, due to the need to monitor extreme request latencies (such as P99) and the average latency of most requests, it is recommended to use &lt;strong&gt;Histogram&lt;/strong&gt; and combine it with a sliding window query to dynamically analyze system performance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog Translation Project Musings: Cultural Transmission, AI Programming</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Cultural Propagation: Its ideological influence, subtle and pervasive.
AI Programming: Not performing software design, resulting in a lot of rework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cultural-propagation&#34;&gt;Cultural Propagation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the project only supported English, Japanese, and Korean. Thinking it was just AI translation, we wondered if supporting more languages wouldn’t be a good idea. So, French, Russian, and Hindi were added. At this point, no problems were detected; when the program executed translations, formatting issues arose due to historical code problems, requiring re-translation of archived articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical timing reminders indicated that it would take nearly 20 hours to complete all translations, given that it was a large local model with 12b parameters. Considering reducing translation time, we deleted French, Russian, and Hindi. This is when things started to feel wrong – why did I instinctively choose Korean and Japanese among the initially supported languages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to global population distribution, these two languages had relatively small audiences, especially Korean, which had approximately 80 million users worldwide. Japanese was slightly more prevalent, with around 1.2 billion people. In contrast, French, Russian, and Hindi had user populations exceeding 100 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we realized that the popularity of Korean and Japanese wasn’t due to the sheer number of language speakers, but rather the influence of cultural propagation. Korean and Japanese cultures have a wide-reaching impact globally, particularly in Asia. K-pop, anime, and television dramas attracted a large fanbase, leading these fans to naturally develop an interest in the corresponding languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at our growth history, I frequently watched Japanese anime and manga as a child, and later watched many Korean films and TV series. This led me to instinctively choose these familiar languages when setting up the project’s initial language settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;software-design-and-ai-programming&#34;&gt;Software Design and AI Programming
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial translation assistant was initially just a simple tool, but after experiencing Claude4’s coding capabilities, it gradually expanded its functionality, adding modules for article translation and tag translation. As the features increased, so did the code complexity. Although AI refactored the codebase to appear more organized, in expanding new functionalities or fixing bugs, AI-generated code often suffered from repetition issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI lacks a holistic understanding of overall structure and design principles when generating code. It typically modifies and extends existing code rather than effectively reusing existing modules, leading to redundant code. Manual cleanup of duplicate code is then required, which inadvertently increases development costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while AI-generated code is syntactically correct, it often suffers from problems in logic and design. For example, a slight adjustment to the prompt in another project resulted in completely different webpage structures lacking consistency. This reflects a lack of proper initial design, with new features added arbitrarily and haphazardly, leading to a chaotic codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also reminds us that core software engineering experience remains indispensable. A rational design not only reduces rework but also enhances code maintainability and extensibility. While AI is a powerful tool, it cannot replace human deep understanding and planning of systems.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog Translation Project Musings: Historical Conversations</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-translation-project-musings-historical-conversations/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 21:16:24 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-translation-project-musings-historical-conversations/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The initial design of the blog translation project was overly complex – first parsing Markdown format, then using placeholders to protect the content, and finally sending it to a large model for translation. This was entirely unnecessary; large models inherently possess the ability to recognize Markdown syntax and can directly process the original content while maintaining formatting during translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work shifted from debugging code to debugging the &lt;strong&gt;prompting&lt;/strong&gt; of the model.
Model: &lt;code&gt;google/gemma-3-4b&lt;/code&gt;
Hardware: &lt;code&gt;Nvidia 3060 12GB&lt;/code&gt;
Indeed, we chose a non-thinking model – thinking models were inefficient when executing translation tasks. We compared the performance of 4b and 12b parameters, and for translation purposes, gemma3’s 4b parameter was sufficient; there was no significant advantage in terms of 12b parameters.
12b parameter speed: &lt;strong&gt;11.32 tok/sec&lt;/strong&gt; , 4b parameter speed: &lt;strong&gt;75.21 tok/sec&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-introduction&#34;&gt;Background Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite adding various constraints within the &lt;strong&gt;system&lt;/strong&gt;, the output translation results still presented some issues, such as: lack of formatting protection, inclusion of extraneous explanatory content. When defining roles, it was already stated to protect Markdown format and only output translation results; ultimately, the translation remained unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I remembered encountering a comic translation project previously, which also leveraged the capabilities of large models. Its translation effect seemed better than mine. Upon reviewing the code and comparing the request data, the comic translation project would include a set of context with each request, in addition to the current translation content, it would also include previous translation content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What were the benefits? Not only did this improve the coherence between preceding and following translations, but it also ensured the stability of the output format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-historical-conversations&#34;&gt;The Importance of Historical Conversations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As large AI models (such as the GPT series, Claude, Gemini, etc.) become more prevalent, an increasing number of businesses and developers are accessing these models via APIs to build intelligent customer service, content generation, code assistant, and other applications. However, many people encounter a common issue during initial access: &lt;strong&gt;model outputs are disjointed, lack contextual understanding, and even answer the wrong questions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key reason for this phenomenon is – &lt;strong&gt;not including historical conversation content in API requests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-history-dialogue&#34;&gt;What is a History Dialogue?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A history dialogue refers to the exchange records between a model and a user within a single conversation session. In most large language model APIs (such as OpenAI’s Chat Completions API), developers need to construct the complete &lt;code&gt;messages&lt;/code&gt; array themselves, passing the historical dialogue in turn as &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;assistant&lt;/code&gt; message format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;model&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;gpt-4&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;messages&amp;quot;: [
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Write me a resignation letter&amp;quot;},
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;assistant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Okay, what do you want to write about as the reason for your resignation?&amp;quot;},
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;I want to pursue personal career development&amp;quot;}
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you only send the last sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;I want to pursue personal career development&amp;quot;}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model won&amp;rsquo;t know you are writing a resignation letter, and its output quality will be very poor because it doesn’t understand the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-historical-dialogue-is-so-important&#34;&gt;Why Historical Dialogue is So Important?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-build-context-enhance-coherence&#34;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Build Context, Enhance Coherence&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI models are inherently “context-driven.” They cannot remember anything that has happened “previously,” unless you explicitly tell it. By passing in the dialogue history, the model can better understand your intent and topic context, resulting in outputs more aligned with expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-reduce-misunderstanding-rate&#34;&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Reduce Misunderstanding Rate&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want the model to complete a multi-turn instruction, such as writing, summarizing, or debugging code, historical context allows the model to gradually accumulate understanding and avoid going off-topic or losing focus midway through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-simulating-realistic-human-dialogue-behavior&#34;&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Simulating Realistic Human Dialogue Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical applications such as customer service systems, educational assistants, and health consultations, user questions often unfold gradually rather than being expressed clearly in a single instance. Preserving dialogue history allows the AI to behave more like a “memoryful assistant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-correctly-add-historical-conversations-in-an-api&#34;&gt;How to Correctly Add Historical Conversations in an API?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s API as an example, we recommend following the structure below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;messages = [
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;You are a professional legal assistant&amp;quot;},
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;What are the essential conditions for a contract?&amp;quot;},
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;assistant&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Contract validity requires fulfilling several conditions: ...&amp;quot;},
    {&amp;quot;role&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Does an oral agreement count?&amp;quot;}
]

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model=&amp;quot;gpt-4&amp;quot;,
    messages=messages
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt; message to set the model&amp;rsquo;s behavior and identity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only retain recent key conversations, not necessarily the entire history (to avoid exceeding token limits).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In long sessions, truncate early content and maintain core information summaries to control token consumption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practical-recommendations&#34;&gt;Practical Recommendations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue State Management&lt;/strong&gt;: The backend needs to design caching mechanisms to record each user’s conversation history (e.g., Redis, database).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Length&lt;/strong&gt;: OpenAI GPT-4 has a context length of 128k tokens, Claude 3 can reach 200k~1M, and requires reasonable truncation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Summarization of History&lt;/strong&gt;: When the historical content is too long, use a model to first summarize the old conversations before adding them to the dialogue context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI large model capabilities are powerful, but developers need to “feed” it sufficient contextual information. &lt;strong&gt;By adding historical conversations within API requests, not only can the quality and coherence of the model’s output be significantly improved, but users can also experience a more natural and realistic conversation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you&amp;rsquo;re building AI customer service, writing assistants, coding helpers, or educational applications, this is an optimization technique that cannot be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Find all functions not referenced in the Go project.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/find-all-functions-not-referenced-in-the-go-project/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 21:10:47 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/find-all-functions-not-referenced-in-the-go-project/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a Go language project, using &lt;code&gt;staticcheck&lt;/code&gt; to find unused functions is an efficient static analysis method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-install-staticcheck&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Install staticcheck&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that Go (version 1.16+) is installed, and then execute the following command to install &lt;code&gt;staticcheck&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-basic-usage-finding-unused-functions&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Basic Usage: Finding Unused Functions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run the following command in the project root directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;staticcheck ./...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Check Rules:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U1000&lt;/strong&gt;: Detects unused functions, methods, variables, or types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U1001&lt;/strong&gt;: Detects unused parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-filter-specific-check-rules&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Filter Specific Check Rules&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you only want to check unused functions, you can specify the rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;staticcheck -checks=U1000 ./...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-output-format&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Output Format&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Default output format is &lt;code&gt;{path}:{line}:{column}: {message}&lt;/code&gt;, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;main.go:10:2: func UnusedFunction is unused (U1000)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-configuration-file-optional&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Configuration File (Optional)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;.staticcheck.conf&lt;/code&gt; file in the project root directory to customize inspection rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;checks&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;U1000&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;-ST1000&amp;quot;]  // Enable U1000, disable ST1000 (string formatting rule)

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a comment &lt;code&gt;//lint:ignore U1000 reason&lt;/code&gt; above the function to ignore the check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-go&#34;&gt;//lint:ignore U1000 Used by generated code
func UnusedButNeeded() {}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;frequently-asked-questions&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How do I handle unused functions in test files?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A: &lt;code&gt;staticcheck&lt;/code&gt; defaults to checking test files. To exclude them, use the &lt;code&gt;-tests=false&lt;/code&gt; flag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How do I integrate it into CI/CD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A: Add to GitHub Actions:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

cmd/server/main.go:23:2: func initConfig is unused (U1000)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;staticcheck&lt;/code&gt; rule &lt;code&gt;U1000&lt;/code&gt;, you can quickly identify and clean up unused functions, improving code quality.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Zhejiang financial circle collapsed, and the anti-corruption efforts over the past two years have not been limited to government departments.</title>

        <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 20:57:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/the-zhejiang-financial-circle-collapsed-and-the-anti-corruption-efforts-over-the-past-two-years-have-not-been-limited-to-government-departments/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw a report on Douyin about an anti-corruption investigation in the Zhejiang financial sector. I had written about the prelude to financial corruption once before, but didn&amp;rsquo;t follow up on related reports afterward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still check financial news every day, and previously I rarely saw any reports about financial corruption. However, there have been increasing reports of financial corruption over the past two years, with more and more senior executives from banks, securities firms, and other financial institutions being investigated.
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain-rise/&#34; &gt;Financial Anti-Corruption Curtain Rise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent systemic anti-corruption storm in the Zhejiang financial sector is one of the most iconic events in China’s financial field in recent years. This anti-corruption campaign, which began in 2023, centered around the collective downfall of the former presidents of Zhejiang branches of four major state-owned banks, exposing long-standing issues of power abuse and collusion between government and businesses within local financial systems. The following outlines the event timeline, core problems, underlying causes, and subsequent impacts from four dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-event-timeline-from-the-zhu-xiaoyu-case-to-the-collapse-of-the-gang-leaders-of-the-four-major-banks&#34;&gt;I. Event Timeline: From the Zhu Xiaoyu Case to the Collapse of the “Gang Leaders” of the Four Major Banks
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Spark: The Zhu Xiaoyu Case Unearths a Rotten Financial System Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In May 2023, Zhejiang Provincial Vice Governor Zhu Xiaoyu was investigated, and his corrupt pattern of &amp;ldquo;eating off finance&amp;rdquo; became a breakthrough point. During his tenure, he obtained massive profits through interfering in corporate IPOs and loans, and formed an alliance of interests with financial institution executives. In November 2023, Zhu Xiaoyu was expelled from the Communist Party and public office, and the numerous clues provided during the investigation directly triggered subsequent seismic events within the financial system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Corruption Storm Intensifies: Original Heads of Zhejiang Branches of the Four Major Banks Fall&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; Guo XinGang, the former Chairman of the China Bank’s Zhejiang Branch, was investigated. After retiring, he made money through low-priced property purchases and equity premiums, abusing his authority in mineral loan approvals, resulting in significant losses of state assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; Gao Qiang, the former Chairman of the Construction Bank’s Zhejiang Branch, was investigated. During his tenure, he illegally approved loans leading to multiple projects going bankrupt and receiving “consulting fees” exceeding tens of millions of yuan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; Feng Jianlong, the former Chairman of the Agricultural Bank’s Zhejiang Branch, voluntarily confessed, and during his tenure, he transformed the Zhejiang branch of the Agricultural Bank into a &amp;ldquo;family industrial business,&amp;rdquo; with relatives holding illegal positions and serious misconduct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 30, 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; Shen Rongqin, the former Chairman of ICBC’s Zhejiang Branch, was investigated. After retiring, he controlled institutions such as Changtang River Jinran Academy through “political rotation,” forming a network of interests with eight private enterprises.  Within 15 months, all the original heads of the four major banks&amp;rsquo; Zhejiang branches fell, creating a closed-loop anti-corruption effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory System Also Shakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In January 2025, Pan Guang’en, former Deputy Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee’s Financial Bureau, voluntarily confessed, using his privileged position to facilitate corporate equity reforms and investments, illegally receiving massive amounts of money. This marked a shift in the anti-corruption campaign from financial institutions to regulatory departments, revealing the deep entanglement of the “regulatory-financial institution-private enterprise” three-party interest chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-core-issues-credit-corruption-and-rotating-door-interest-chains&#34;&gt;II. Core Issues: Credit Corruption and Rotating Door Interest Chains
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misappropriation of Lending Power: The Core Tool of Corruption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All four former heads of the major banks utilized their lending power to transfer interests: Guo XinGang violated regulations by issuing mineral loans, Gao Qiang manipulated credit through “consulting fees,” Feng Jianlong’s family-style lending led to bad debts, and Shen Rongqin used the Golden Research Institute platform to channel funds to related enterprises. Data shows that 68% of individuals investigated within the banking system in 2024 were involved in illegal lending or loan approvals, highlighting a deeply concerning loss of control over lending power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotational Corruption: Retirement is Not a Safe Deposit Box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All four individuals continued to wield power through “identity transformation” after retirement: Guo XinGang served as the president of an industry association to intervene in credit lending, Gao Qiang transitioned to a securities dealer director to manipulate capital, and Shen Rongqin established a “financial-academic-research” platform to connect with private enterprises. This “retire and continue” model allowed retired executives to evade regulation and form hidden interest chains. The 2024 Financial Anti-Corruption White Paper revealed that 68% of cases involved retired executives, with the Zhejiang case serving as a typical example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurred Boundaries Between Government and Business: Interest Transfer from Banks to Private Enterprises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Changtang River Golden Research Institute, led by Shen Rongqin, was established with investments from eight private enterprises including Zhentai and Chuanhua, ostensibly an academic institution but in reality a political-economic nexus. Through this platform, Shen Rongqin directed banking resources towards related enterprises, forming a “banking institution – private enterprise think tank” binding model. Similar models were also evident in the cases of Guo XinGang and Gao Qiang, exposing the deep distortion of political-economic relations within local financial ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;three-root-causes-institutional-loopholes-and-regulatory-failures&#34;&gt;Three. Root Causes: Institutional Loopholes and Regulatory Failures
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Absence of Local Financial Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a major province for private economy, Zhejiang has been active in financial innovation, but the regulatory system hasn’t kept pace. Officials such as Zhu from Ju and Pan Guang&amp;rsquo;en have long dominated local financial policies, acting as both “athletes” and “referees,” leading to ineffective regulation. For example, during his tenure at the Financial Bureau, Pan Guang&amp;rsquo;en illegally interfered in corporate financing and share reform, but was not effectively restrained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure of Internal Controls within Financial Institutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internal supervision mechanisms of the four major banks’ Zhejiang branches were essentially empty. When Feng Jianlong served as the chairman of Zhejiang Branch of Agricultural Bank, his relatives quickly rose through the system, and the “one-voice” credit approval phenomenon was prominent. Shen Rongqin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Employee Care Plan&amp;rdquo; ostensibly provided welfare, but actually consolidated power by controlling frontline employees to cover up corrupt behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak External Supervision Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enabling of cross-provincial investigations (such as the Shen Rongqin case being handled by the Liaoning Provincial Supervisory Commission) demonstrated that local protectionism had severely hindered anti-corruption progress. Furthermore, the complex equity relationships between financial institutions and private enterprises (such as half of the top ten loan customers of Zhejiang Merchants Bank were real estate companies) made risk transmission hidden, making traditional regulatory measures difficult to penetrate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;four-subsequent-impacts-regulatory-upgrading-and-industry-restructuring&#34;&gt;Four. Subsequent Impacts: Regulatory Upgrading and Industry Restructuring
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normalization of Anti-Corruption and Systemic Plugging of Leaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Provincial Supervision and Penetrating Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;: The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection adopted remote case handling to cut through local protection networks, and extended the scope of scrutiny from on-duty behavior to interest chains after retirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological Anti-Corruption Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;: Zhejiang piloted AI risk control models for credit approval, automatically identifying “people-based loans” and “political-business loans,” effectively curbing corruption at its source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restrictions on Departing Executives&lt;/strong&gt;: Zhejiang Province is drafting the &amp;ldquo;List of Financial Executive Post-Employment Restrictions,&amp;rdquo; stipulating that bank chairpersons are prohibited from serving affiliated companies within three years after retirement, cutting off chains of power options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restructuring of the Financial Ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systemic Risk Clearance in Banks&lt;/strong&gt;: Institutions such as Zhejiang Business Bank and Hangzhou Bank were initiated internal restructuring due to the downfall of senior executives, and high real estate loan ratios (such as Zhejiang Business Bank’s real estate non-performing asset rate reaching 2.48%) forced business transformation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimization of Financing Environment for Private Enterprises&lt;/strong&gt;: Following anti-corruption actions, Zhejiang Province launched policies such as “Zheke Loan,” providing 450 billion yuan in loans to 32,000 technology SMEs in 2024, driving finance back to its original purpose of serving the real economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Warning Effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The collective downfall of former branch managers of the four major banks in Zhejiang shattered the illusion of “safety after retirement,” conveying a signal of “zero tolerance and no blind spots” in financial anti-corruption. This event also provides a mirror for the entire Chinese financial system: only by strengthening power constraints and improving regulatory systems can we safeguard financial security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the Zhejiang financial circle was fundamentally a concentrated outburst of long-term loss of control over local financial power. This storm not only cleared out a number of “financial pests,” but also drove profound changes in regulatory models, institutional design, and industry ecosystems. In the future, how to balance financial innovation with risk management, and how to build “clean” government-business relationships will continue to be subjects of ongoing exploration for Zhejiang and even the entire Chinese financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Git Submodule Merge History Lost</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-submodule-merge-history-lost/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 16:44:58 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-submodule-merge-history-lost/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a Git repository locally where submodules were in temporary branches during the initial pull. I made commits on that temporary branch, and then switched back to the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch. However, those committed changes seem to be lost and cannot be found within the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch. I also can&amp;rsquo;t find any record of that temporary branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions&#34;&gt;Solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After committing to a temporary branch within the Git submodule and switching back to the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch, these commits are no longer found. This situation can be resolved by following the steps below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verify Commit History&lt;/strong&gt;: Navigate to the submodule directory and use &lt;code&gt;reflog&lt;/code&gt; to find the lost commits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a New Branch to Save Commits&lt;/strong&gt;: Create a new branch based on the lost commit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merge or Cherry-Pick Commits to Main&lt;/strong&gt;: Integrate the code into the main branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the specific steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;# Enter the submodule directory
cd path/to/your/submodule

# View reflog records all HEAD changes (including commits not associated with branches)
git reflog

PS F:\dev\notebook\scripts\hugo-content-suite&amp;gt; git reflog
de05175 (HEAD -&amp;gt; main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from c8d070651310e90d283cb64d98da088c5fe05e73 to main

# Create a new branch based on the lost commit (e.g., using 456def commit)
git checkout -b saved-work 456def

# Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the saved work into main (or use cherry-pick to select specific commits)
git merge saved-work
# Or
git cherry-pick 456def

# Return to the parent project directory and commit submodule updates
cd ..
git add path/to/your/submodule
git commit -m &amp;quot;Update submodule to include new changes&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-operational-instructions&#34;&gt;Key Operational Instructions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git reflog&lt;/strong&gt;: Displays the entire history of HEAD, including commits not associated with any branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git checkout -b&lt;/strong&gt;: Creates a new branch from any commit and saves your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;git merge/cherry-pick&lt;/strong&gt;: Integrates saved commits into the target branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the reflog doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain records, you may need to try using &lt;code&gt;git fsck --lost-found&lt;/code&gt; to find orphaned commits, but this is a rare occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GitHub Pages Easter Egg: Deploying Multiple Pages</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/github-pages-easter-egg-deploy-multiple-sites/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 02:55:54 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/github-pages-easter-egg-deploy-multiple-sites/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, my biological clock has been a bit off, still tinkering with GitHub Pages deployments around 2 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to eat after work, and I just wanted to sleep when I finished, then came back around 8:30 PM, feeling drowsy, thinking I’d take a nap, and ended up falling asleep immediately. When I woke up, it was already past 2 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;facepalm&#34;&gt;Facepalm
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we said there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be much frontend development, but today it’s not frontend – it’s the experience of UI/UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project&#34;&gt;Project
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please join our old friend, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&lt;/a&gt;.
That’s the original self-selected stock project – we&amp;rsquo;re restructuring the overall project structure, and all subsequent AI programming content will be housed within this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploying-multiple-pages&#34;&gt;Deploying Multiple Pages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project is hosted domestically at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cnb.cool/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://cnb.cool/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&lt;/a&gt;. Due to well-known reasons, pages cannot be published within China, so we need to publish them on GitHub outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog is published on the external GitHub. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried this before, and also, the current project I’m working on isn’t a traditional blog site; it simply contains a lot of documentation layered with several static HTML design mockups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/github-pages-easter-egg-deploy-multiple-sites/20250528030230.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right – this page is where I discovered that deploying multiple pages using pages won&amp;rsquo;t affect the blog’s publication, but instead adds a new path under the blog’s domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/ai-coding-demo/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;I was absolutely thrilled when I saw this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-study-group&#34;&gt;AI Study Group
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I created a new category and thought about using AI to learn many computer courses, such as algorithms and LeetCode practice problems.
Each learning record is published on the blog to form a knowledge base. A new category was created: AI Study Group.
Now it seems that different courses require creating separate projects, and all learning notes are written in the project&amp;rsquo;s Readme.md file.&lt;/p&gt;

Alternatively, a more literal translation could be: “Old ailments, beautiful eyes like blooming flowers.” However, the first option is generally preferred for its aesthetic quality.</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;For many years, I’ve focused on backend development, and recently started to explore &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; programming while dipping my toes into some frontend-related content. However, during this period of tinkering, I gradually realized I was falling back into an old habit – being dazzled by shiny new things. I constantly try to use &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; to create a frontend interface, but in reality, these attempts haven’t provided much practical benefit for my current work and are actually wasting my energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-use-cases&#34;&gt;AI Use Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In small projects, AI tools can truly shine, particularly when writing independent functions with low coupling to the system and simple business logic. These tasks typically have clear inputs and outputs, and rely less on context – making them well-suited for the current capabilities of AI-assisted programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when facing complex system architectures or deep business logic, AI’s limitations begin to emerge. It may generate code that appears reasonable but is actually detached from the project&amp;rsquo;s real needs, or even introduce potential issues that are difficult to debug. In these scenarios, AI is best suited as an assistive tool rather than a fully autonomous code generator. We need to conduct rigorous review and testing of the generated code to ensure it meets actual requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;errors-and-the-cost-of-learning&#34;&gt;Errors and the Cost of Learning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While attempting to generate frontend code using AI, I encountered numerous challenges. As frontend development isn&amp;rsquo;t a domain I’m familiar with, troubleshooting often proved time-consuming and frustrating. Even after adjusting prompts to have the AI rewrite the code, it was difficult to avoid the appearance of some low-level errors. This iterative process not only wasted time but also highlighted that my current focus should be on backend business logic rather than groping around in unfamiliar territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the project completed over the weekend, I’m even more convinced that focusing on backend development and user interaction logic, implementing functionality through a console, is the most efficient approach currently. Perhaps systematically learning frontend knowledge would be a better strategy when I have more time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;frontend-learning-plan&#34;&gt;Frontend Learning Plan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frontend technology stack is complex and diverse, so it’s unrealistic to quickly master it. I plan to first choose a framework, such as Vue.js or React.js, and deeply learn its core concepts and usage methods. Only after becoming familiar with the fundamentals will I attempt to use AI to generate frontend code, which can effectively avoid errors and wasted time caused by unfamiliarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the focus for this stage should be on backend development, steadily building my core skills. When the timing is right, I’ll then explore the combination of frontend and AI – potentially yielding greater rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Claude4 released, attempting to develop: Hugo tags, hyperlink translation assistant</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/claude-4-release-hugo-tags-hyperlink-translation-assistant/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 03:05:31 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/claude-4-release-hugo-tags-hyperlink-translation-assistant/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This site is developed using Hugo, but I’ve always used Chinese titles, which results in less friendly generated article links. In simpler terms, when shared, they don&amp;rsquo;t look as good because the Chinese characters are escaped into formats like %E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD within the links. While you can solve this by setting a slug, it’s tedious to do manually every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I decided to try using Claude4 to develop a translation assistant that automatically converts Chinese titles to English slugs and adds hyperlinks within the articles. This would eliminate the need for manual setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude4 is amazing – its contextual understanding has significantly improved, as has its efficiency in handling complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-address&#34;&gt;Project Address
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestic Project Address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cnb.cool/ttf248/hugo-content-suite&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://cnb.cool/ttf248/hugo-content-suite&lt;/a&gt;
International Project Address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/hugo-content-suite&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/ttf248/hugo-content-suite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-implementation&#34;&gt;Code Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s first discuss the implementation approach: We need to scan all articles, extract tag information and article titles, and then call on our local large model (such as gemma-3-12b-it) for translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In actual development, Claude4 showcased several significant advantages compared to previous generation large models. Due to the diverse functional requirements, Claude4 automatically designed an interactive menu, comprehensively considering various usage scenarios. For example, in tag processing, Claude4 not only supports tag statistics and analysis but also includes classification statistics and can even detect &lt;strong&gt;unlabeled articles&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, it provides &lt;strong&gt;preview&lt;/strong&gt; and tag page generation functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s integrating with local large models, adding translation caches, or performing large-scale code refactoring, Claude4 completes everything in one go, with almost no issues. Despite the relatively small project size, it includes many minor features. In previous development processes, large models often forgot earlier content, but Claude4 performed exceptionally well this time, &lt;strong&gt;virtually without any context forgetting issues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, intelligence has increased, and we plan to switch to Claude4 for more development work as our primary coding model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;translation-cache&#34;&gt;Translation Cache
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach, besides reducing the number of calls to large models, performs quite efficiently when running a 12b model locally – it doesn’t waste much time. However, if you need to call the large model every time, it will still be somewhat slow. Furthermore, to fix the connections within articles, if a full update operation is executed and the article title is very long, there&amp;rsquo;s occasionally a situation where the two translated results differ, causing the link to change – which is quite awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;feature-optimization&#34;&gt;Feature Optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire project was handed over to &lt;code&gt;Claude4&lt;/code&gt; to analyze the space for optimization and obtain the following suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Externalize Configuration - Improve maintainability and flexibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structured Logging - Facilitate troubleshooting and monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance Monitoring - Understand system running status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Experience - Visual feedback such as progress bars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error Handling - A more robust exception handling mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Organization - Clearer module division&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code was reviewed, and there were no major issues, such as the configuration files. The original code&amp;rsquo;s configurations were converted to default settings, and if a corresponding configuration file wasn’t found during reading, a default one would be automatically generated to prevent user errors.
Requirement: When translating text into English, dynamically calculate the current translation efficiency, estimate the remaining time, and output relevant information to the console: Now it has obtained the character count of the article, the character count for each line being translated, the translation time, and fits the calculation of the translation time for every 100 characters. Simultaneously, it calculates the estimated remaining translation time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code was completed, but the effect wasn&amp;rsquo;t very satisfactory, so I asked AI to provide a new design solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide multiple efficiency calculation methods: Real-time efficiency, average efficiency, sliding window efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve display method: Progress bars, segmented statistics, dynamic refresh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more useful metrics: API call counts, success rates, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the code was completed, a new surprise was discovered – translation efficiency statistics flooded in in real time, but without endless scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, the control program wasn&amp;rsquo;t written with many features, so I was curious about how it was implemented and looked at the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-golang&#34;&gt;// Clear screen and redisplay (dynamic refresh effect)
if translationCount &amp;gt; 1 {

        <title>Multi-dimensional impacts of the family planning policy: deep transformations from social structure to economic and political changes.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-family-planning-policy-impacts/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 02:36:49 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-family-planning-policy-impacts/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;China’s population control policies, while limiting growth and curbing family-style development, have disrupted traditional social structures, suppressed the expansion of family-owned businesses and political dynasty power, presenting a unique case compared to South Korean conglomerates and Indian family monopolies. Now that birth restrictions are being relaxed, despite facing challenges such as low fertility rates, it’s crucial to be wary of new monopoly risks and seek balance through multiple avenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;one-the-disjunction-between-population-control-and-family-style-development&#34;&gt;One: The Disjunction Between Population Control and Family-Style Development
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family planning policy, which has been a fundamental national strategy in China for nearly forty years, has achieved significant direct results. Data shows that from 1978 to 2007, the natural growth rate of China’s population declined from 12‰ to 5.2‰, resulting in a reduction of over 40 million people, and the proportion of the Chinese population worldwide decreased from 22.2% to 20.1%. This sharp decline in population growth profoundly reshaped family structures within Chinese society. Taking family-owned enterprises as an example, after the implementation of the family planning policy, the number of children born by business owners declined significantly: before the policy, the proportion of those having three or more children reached 40.63%, and after the policy it plummeted to 18.46%, the proportion of single sons born increased from 6.25% to 32.31%. This structural change directly reduced the range of potential internal successors for family-owned enterprises, objectively suppressing their generational expansion capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Korea and India, the differences are significant. Although Korea did not implement strict family planning policies, its birth rate has remained low (0.7 in 2023), however, its chaebols have maintained control over the national economy through cross-shareholdings and tax avoidance mechanisms. The total revenue of the top five chaebols accounts for more than 50% of Korea’s GDP, with Samsung Group alone accounting for 20% of the country&amp;rsquo;s GDP. India, on the other hand, presents a different picture: 79% of economic output is contributed by family-owned enterprises, and six major conglomerates control key sectors such as telecommunications and steel, with twenty top companies earning 80% of national corporate profits. The core of this difference lies in the fact that China’s family planning policy, through limiting family size, has weakened the human resources base for family-owned enterprise expansion from the source, while Korea and India have been able to sustain their influence in economic sectors due to different policy environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;two-monopoly-restraint-and-social-structural-transformation&#34;&gt;Two. Monopoly Restraint and Social Structural Transformation
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the economic sector is particularly evident in its suppression of monopoly phenomena. Due to the reduced number of children within Chinese family businesses, the formation of Han-Indian style conglomerates like those led by chaebols was difficult. Taking Korea as an example, chaebols maintained control through “circular investment,” with the Samsung family holding only 2% of the group’s shares but controlling the entire operation through complex equity structures. In China, after the family planning policy, family businesses generally faced the dilemma of “passing down from father to son,” often necessitating the introduction of professional managers or implementing equity diversification reforms. According to a湃新闻 (Papare News) study, the proportion of female successors in family businesses after family planning increased from 13.85% to 34.21%, and the education level of these successors significantly improved, with the percentage of college graduates rising from 43.75% to 98.46%. While this transformation has not completely eliminated family control, it has significantly reduced the possibility of a single family monopolizing the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the social structural level, the family planning policy accelerated the disintegration of traditional family core models. The average household size in China decreased from 4.41 people/household in 1982 to 2.62 people/household in 2020, weakening the family’s functions in areas such as economics, education, and social support. In contrast, India maintains a family size of around 4 people, with the caste system deeply intertwined with family power, leading to low social mobility. China&amp;rsquo;s transformation of household structure created space for individualism, with the number of single adult citizens reaching 240 million in 2023, and a trend of “one-person economy” emerging in the consumer market – further diminishing the influence of family economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;three-decentralization-of-power-in-the-political-sphere&#34;&gt;Three. Decentralization of Power in the Political Sphere
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the political landscape has been profound. Traditionally, family power structures had infiltrated grassroots politics through bloodlines and kinship relationships. For example, the 161 political families in Henan’s Xinye County virtually controlled all government departments, with 20% of cadres at deputy-level or above belonging to “officer’s children.” However, after the implementation of the family planning policy, shrinking family sizes limited the expansion of family networks. Research from Peking University showed that the number of offspring of officials decreased after family planning, and the complexity of family political networks significantly declined. Furthermore, the policy-driven promotion of education (the average years of schooling increased from 5.2 in 1982 to 10.9 in 2023) facilitated social mobility, weakening the monopoly of family power over political resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison with South Korea and India, the deep entanglement between Korean conglomerates and politics (such as Samsung Group executives engaging in bribery with government officials) and the hereditary family politics under the Indian caste system highlighted the uniqueness of China’s policy. China objectively reduced the possibility of power succession through the family planning policy. Despite the presence of family phenomena in county-level politics, the overall trend is towards the decentralization of the power structure. During the 2025 National People&amp;rsquo;s Congress meeting, a CPPCC member proposed renaming “The Law on Population and Family Planning” to “The Law on Population and Reproduction,” fully opening up childbirth – a move that may further influence the future evolution of the political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;four-challenges-and-opportunities-following-policy-adjustments&#34;&gt;Four, Challenges and Opportunities Following Policy Adjustments
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the 2016 comprehensive two-child policy and the 2021 three-child policy marked a significant shift in China’s birth policies. However, the effects were limited: In 2022, the birth rate was only 1.18, far below the replacement level (2.1). The relaxation of birth restrictions had a dual impact on family-owned enterprises: On one hand, some entrepreneurs may strengthen their family succession capabilities through multiple births, such as Zong Qinghui, the daughter of Zhong Quehui of Wahaha Group in Zhejiang, who took over as the sole heir; on the other hand, high childcare costs (the average cost of raising a child to 18 years old in first-tier cities reaches 10 million yuan) and declining fertility intentions among professional women limited the expansion of family size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the economic sphere, relaxing birth restrictions may give rise to new monopoly forms. The three-child policy has accelerated the concentration of the maternal and childcare industry, with the market size of infant and toddler care expected to reach 1621.3 billion yuan in 2025. Leading companies have consolidated smaller manufacturers through mergers and acquisitions, resulting in a CR5 market concentration exceeding 55%. This increase in concentration may bring efficiency, but it also needs to be wary of new monopoly risks. The government must seek a balance between encouraging births and preventing market concentration, such as strengthening regulation through antitrust laws while providing childcare subsidies (such as Hangzhou’s three-child families receiving a monthly milk powder subsidy of 3000 yuan) to reduce family burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the political sphere, relaxing birth restrictions may have subtle impacts on family power structures. Although it is unlikely to restore traditional family political networks in the short term, from a long-term perspective, multi-child families may form new influence in grassroots politics. Therefore, improving personnel selection mechanisms and strengthening supervision (such as establishing a cadre relative appointment avoidance system) are still crucial for preventing hereditary power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;five-international-mirroring-and-future-outlook&#34;&gt;Five. International Mirroring and Future Outlook
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiences of South Korea and India demonstrate that the ebb and flow of family power is closely linked to policy orientations. South Korea achieved economic takeoff by supporting conglomerates, but at the cost of social inequality; India’s failure to implement effective policies to curb family monopolies has exacerbated wealth disparity. China&amp;rsquo;s population control policy effectively suppressed the expansion of family powers while simultaneously creating problems such as an aging population and labor shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, China needs to find a new balance between population policy and socio-economic development. On one hand, it should increase birth rates through fertility support policies (such as extending maternity leave and building accessible childcare institutions); on the other hand, it must strengthen antitrust enforcement to prevent family businesses from forming new monopolies through capital operations. In the political sphere, further progress is needed in grassroots democracy construction, strengthening oversight mechanisms, and ensuring transparency in governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, population control policies were a key driver of social change in China, with impacts far exceeding the realm of population. They reshaped family structures, economic models, and the political landscape, providing a path for China to avoid falling into the trap of family monopolies seen in Korea and India. As policies are adjusted, balancing efficiency and equity, freedom and order within the new demographic context will be a long-term challenge facing China.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AI overuse can lead to some lingering effects.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-overuse-side-effects/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 19:39:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-overuse-side-effects/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since we’ve established “AI Inspiration Collision Forum,” there’s been a lot of random content being created, with people experimenting with AI to record and publish things, but thoughtful reflection is becoming increasingly scarce. Moving forward, it would be beneficial to slightly control the output of this section and consolidate it into a monthly magazine format – releasing one article per month would suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feels like a sort of aftereffect or side effect; efficiency has increased, but the depth and breadth of thought have declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;efficiency-boost-undeniable&#34;&gt;Efficiency Boost: Undeniable
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Seven-Second Fish Sightseeing” column used to be poorly maintained, with only a few hot events covered. Due to laziness, I hadn’t searched the internet for relevant materials or compiled records. Now that various AI tools are available, all it takes is outlining the key points, and AI can automatically search for related events, generate articles as needed, simply format them, and publish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like a blessing for lazy people – efficiency has increased significantly, almost to the point of doubling efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond writing articles, efficiency gains are real when coding. Previously, writing code often required detailed reading of API interface documentation. Now, I can skip this entirely. This is incredibly valuable because familiarizing oneself with APIs is “physical labor,” not “mental labor.” AI handles this part perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spam-content&#34;&gt;Spam Content
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many articles have poor quality content, not to say that there’s nothing there; it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t read well, lacking a sense of reality and what people actually experience. It’s a style I didn’t enjoy before – like chewing wax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From another perspective, AI-generated content really does feel like products of a流水线 (liú shuǐ liàn - assembly line) production, lacking soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Era Internet Spam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forgetting&#34;&gt;Forgetting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of document is entirely AI-generated, and the reader’s context is unclear. However, over time, my own impressions will become blurred, or even forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar issues occur when writing code – without reviewing commit records, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember how I originally thought about it, or why I wrote it that way. This is particularly evident with code generated through repeated communication with AI, where the final code differs significantly from the initial ideas, sometimes drastically so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;search&#34;&gt;Search
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the number of times I’ve opened Google and Baidu has noticeably decreased. Many questions are now being answered by AI for searching and interaction, and the results are much better than traditional search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s mourn the &lt;code&gt;bing ai&lt;/code&gt;, which may no longer be active, a pioneering AI tool from a major company that could connect to the internet and search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using Google less, and the number of times I visit &lt;code&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/code&gt; has decreased as well. Many questions are now simply asked of AI – this website is gradually being phased out by the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My maintained blog, originally with very little traffic, is now even less expected of; it’s primarily a place for self-reflection and recording.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;github-readme-stats&lt;/code&gt; is a GitHub profile statistics generator that allows users to display various statistics and charts within their GitHub profiles. It offers multiple customization options to tailor it to user needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I manage my repository habits by grouping them by project; GitHub doesn&amp;rsquo;t support repository grouping, so I have to achieve this by splitting repositories across different organizations. The latest branch of &lt;code&gt;github-readme-stats&lt;/code&gt; cannot support statistics for repositories spanning different organizations; I forked a branch and merged the corresponding code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;merging-a-pull-request-into-your-forked-repository&#34;&gt;Merging a Pull Request into Your Forked Repository
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To merge a &lt;strong&gt;Pull Request (PR)&lt;/strong&gt; into your &lt;strong&gt;forked repository&lt;/strong&gt;, there are several ways to do this, depending on whether you want to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge the PR from the &lt;strong&gt;upstream repository&lt;/strong&gt; into your fork, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge a PR from another person’s fork into your fork, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge a PR that was opened on your fork (e.g., someone forked and created a PR for you)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll first give you a common scenario: &lt;strong&gt;You have forked a repository and want to merge a PR from the upstream into your fork&lt;/strong&gt;.  Here’s the workflow below 👇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-method-one-command-line-most-universal&#34;&gt;✅ Method One: Command Line (Most Universal)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-1-clone-your-own-fork&#34;&gt;Step 1: Clone your own fork
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-2-add-upstream-original-repository-address&#34;&gt;Step 2: Add Upstream (Original Repository Address)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-author-username/repository-name.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-3-fetch-the-upstream-pr-branch&#34;&gt;Step 3: Fetch the Upstream PR Branch
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the PR number you want to merge, for example PR #123.
You can then checkout the code for that PR like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git fetch upstream pull/123/head:pr-123
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-4-switch-and-merge-branches&#34;&gt;Step 4: Switch and Merge Branches
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git checkout main    # Or your own target branch
git merge pr-123
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything goes well, you can push to your forked GitHub repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git push origin main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-method-two-github-web-interface-simple-but-limited&#34;&gt;✅ Method Two: GitHub Web Interface (Simple but Limited)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see a PR on GitHub’s web interface that is against the upstream repository, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the PR page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click “&lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt;” or “&lt;strong&gt;Files changed&lt;/strong&gt;” in the top-right corner to see which branch this PR is based on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On your fork page, create a new branch and then manually cherry-pick the PR’s commit (requires Git knowledge).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or, click “&lt;strong&gt;Open in GitHub Desktop&lt;/strong&gt;” and use the GUI tool to merge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-if-someone-has-created-a-fork-and-submitted-a-pr-to-it-simply-navigate-to-the-pr-page-click-the-merge-pull-request-button-and-youre-done&#34;&gt;🚀 If someone has created a fork and submitted a PR to it, simply navigate to the PR page, click the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Merge pull request&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; button, and you’re done.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like me to walk you through it step-by-step based on your specific scenario (e.g., PR link, whether you&amp;rsquo;re using a web interface or the command line)? Or, please provide the link and I can analyze the simplest approach for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Script for batch modifying Git history commit author information, rewriting Git history records using &lt;code&gt;git filter-branch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You provided the script to modify the author information in the Git repository history in bulk. The overall approach is correct, but using an array (e.g., &lt;code&gt;OLD_EMAILS=(&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;) within the &lt;code&gt;git filter-branch&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code&gt;--env-filter&lt;/code&gt; might cause compatibility issues because some shell environments (such as &lt;code&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;) do not support array syntax.
To improve compatibility, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to replace the array with space-separated strings and use a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop to iterate through each old email address. Here is an example of the modified script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;#!/bin/sh

git filter-branch --env-filter &#39;
OLD_EMAILS=&amp;quot;TianlongXiang51@gmail.com nick@qq.com tianlongxiang51@gmail.com&amp;quot;
CORRECT_NAME=&amp;quot;tianlong.xiang&amp;quot;
CORRECT_EMAIL=&amp;quot;tianlong.xiang@foxmail.com&amp;quot;

for OLD_EMAIL in $OLD_EMAILS
do
    if [ &amp;quot;$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;$OLD_EMAIL&amp;quot; ]
    then
        export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_NAME&amp;quot;
        export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_EMAIL&amp;quot;

        <title>No coding, design and develop a self-selected stock module.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/design-develop-custom-stock-module-no-code/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:20:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/design-develop-custom-stock-module-no-code/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last month, we experimented with cursor, but due to the limitations of the free quota, we didn&amp;rsquo;t develop overly complex features; we just did some basic testing. We discovered then that Byte also released similar products, both using the same large models – Claude-3.5 – at their core.
Byte’s product is called Trae, initially launched in the Mac version and finally released its Windows version in February of this year. Big companies are good because you can freely “white嫖” (literally translates to &amp;ldquo;free-eat&amp;rdquo;), without having to pay, with unlimited use of Claude-3.5 – this model performs quite well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we got stuck on the development of candlestick charts. As I don’t understand React at all, I had to give up. To continue developing, I would need to supplement my knowledge of front-end basics, breaking down the task into smaller, more manageable pieces instead of directly giving me a large task: developing candlestick charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;issues-found&#34;&gt;Issues Found
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the lack of training data caused by using foreign AI models and Vue3 + Element-Plus, React was chosen as the frontend framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasional syntax errors may exist and require manual fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solutions for some complex problems require manual guidance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code structure optimization requires manual instruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most time-consuming part was packaging the frontend code into a container, due to my zero foundation in &lt;code&gt;.env.production&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt;, I had no concept of these either; I only straightened out the corresponding logic by asking for help from bean sprouts halfway through. There are significant differences between the dev mode and build mode of frontend development, and the checks performed on the code. Backend database and service container scripts were completed in a total of five minutes.
&lt;strong&gt;Currently, AI mainly improves the efficiency of development; having a foundation is best, not that AI will solve all problems for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;repository-address&#34;&gt;Repository Address
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the title indicates, this time we’re going to try a chat-based approach with AI instead of writing code, aiming to design and develop a self-trading module. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what results we can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repository address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/trae-demo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/ttf248/trae-demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the README.md file in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository contains numerous submission records, most of which are dialogues between me and Trae, along with my testing of Trae’s functionalities, and notes on whether manual intervention was required to implement each feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt&#34;&gt;Prompt
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project is to develop functionality from scratch, based on the following project prototype diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;Based on the project prototype diagram, develop features: stock selection (watchlist), which needs to support adding, deleting, modifying, and querying contracts. The watchlist interface should display basic market data. Support multiple different market switches.

Frontend: react
Backend: golang gin gorm
Database: PostgreSQL

The backend needs to support cross-origin requests, while also considering data validation and error handling. If the backend service is unavailable, the frontend should display an alert message.

The backend needs to display request and response logs; the frontend also prints communication logs for troubleshooting purposes.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ui-and-interaction-optimization&#34;&gt;UI and Interaction Optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design of the front-end interface relies entirely on Grok. We initially created a prototype within Trae, but it lacked aesthetics. Because the model used has strong coding capabilities but weaker other abilities, we need to use Grok to optimize the front-end UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking screenshots of the current interface and uploading them to Grok, we can receive numerous optimization suggestions at once. We then manually evaluate these suggestions and copy them into Trae to execute and observe the results of the optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;technology-stack&#34;&gt;Technology Stack
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend: React + TypeScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backend: Golang + Gin + GORM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database: PostgreSQL 17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;system-architecture&#34;&gt;System Architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;backend-architecture&#34;&gt;Backend Architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backend utilizes the Gin framework (Go) to implement RESTful APIs, with the following key modules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database Module&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilizes GORM as an ORM framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports database connection configuration via environment variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically performs database schema migrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routing Module&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESTful API design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A unified error handling mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in request logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Origin Handling&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports cross-origin requests from local development environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configurable CORS policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports cookie-based cross-origin access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;frontend-architecture&#34;&gt;Frontend Architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frontend was built using React + TypeScript, implementing the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock list display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watchlist management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-time quote data display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error handling mechanism&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>AI Development Over Two Years: Somewhat similar to the state before a Docker release – fragmented and rapidly evolving.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-like-docker-pre-release/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:16:37 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-like-docker-pre-release/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been one of the most hotly debated topics in the technology field in recent years, particularly over the past two years, with AI technology experiencing rapid advancements. Whether it’s deep learning, natural language processing, or computer vision and automated decision systems, the application scenarios for AI are constantly emerging. However, despite continuous technological breakthroughs, AI still faces a bottleneck similar to that of a Docker release – a lack of a killer app to truly ignite the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article: AI has developed for two years, which is somewhat like the state of Docker’s pre-release, lacking a killer application, based on existing technologies, create a perfect landing scenario, Docker did not use too many new technologies, but the overall solution is reasonable, and it changes the workflow of operations and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-development-status-the-technology-is-mature-but-applications-still-need-breakthroughs&#34;&gt;AI Development Status: The Technology is Mature, but Applications Still Need Breakthroughs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, AI has made significant progress in the past two years. Whether it’s OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT series models or Google’s BERT and DeepMind’s Alpha series, AI processing capabilities have far exceeded previous expectations. Particularly in the field of natural language processing, models like GPT-4 not only possess powerful generative abilities but also demonstrate astonishing performance in understanding and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite technological advancements, AI&amp;rsquo;s implementation in practical applications faces certain challenges. Similar to Docker’s state before its release, although AI has enormous potential, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet been a truly widespread and industry-changing killer app. People are talking about the prospects of AI, but they may not be able to find an application that can directly bring about revolutionary changes. Many AI applications remain in their initial stages of experimentation, and most require further integration and optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker-and-ai-parallels-technology-doesnt-have-to-be-innovation-its-about-the-solution&#34;&gt;Docker and AI Parallels: Technology Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Have to Be Innovation, It’s About the Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at Docker’s release history, we can readily see many similarities between the technological environment at the time and the current state of AI development. Before Docker, container technology wasn’t a new concept; early technologies like LXC (Linux Containers) and virtualization already possessed the basic capabilities for containerization. However, Docker didn&amp;rsquo;t introduce disruptive technology itself. Instead, it presented a simpler, more intuitive, and efficient solution through the clever integration and optimization of existing technologies. This solution didn’t rely on revolutionary technological breakthroughs, but rather addressed many pain points in software deployment, scaling, and management processes, significantly simplifying the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the AI field is facing a similar situation. While current AI technology isn&amp;rsquo;t “new,” achieving truly large-scale applications still requires a perfect implementation scenario – just like Docker, integrating and optimizing existing technologies to form a reasonable application solution. Killer AI applications may not rely on entirely new technological breakthroughs, but rather on how to integrate existing technologies to solve practical business pain points and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-ais-docker-moment&#34;&gt;How to Find AI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Docker Moment&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly enable the widespread adoption of AI technology, we need to focus on several key areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Exploration of Practical Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;
Currently, many AI applications are still largely experimental and lack large-scale real-world implementation.  For example, while AI customer service and intelligent recommendations are widely used, their functionality is often limited and hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet broken through industry bottlenecks. True breakthroughs may come from industries that have been struggling with traditional methods for a long time, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics. AI can help these companies improve efficiency and reduce costs in complex scenarios through more efficient data processing and predictive analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productization and Ease of Use&lt;/strong&gt;
Just like Docker simplifies containerization processes to boost operational efficiency, the ease of use of AI products is equally crucial. The widespread adoption of AI isn&amp;rsquo;t just about technological proliferation; it’s also about product proliferation. Integrating AI into daily workflows, allowing users to easily utilize these tools without needing to deeply understand the technology, is a key step in AI implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecosystem Building and Standardization&lt;/strong&gt;
Any new technology’s widespread adoption relies on ecosystem building. Docker&amp;rsquo;s rapid rise was due to its openness and compatibility, enabling developers to seamlessly integrate with various cloud platforms, tools, and services. Similarly, the future of AI depends on the construction of an ecosystem.  Standardization of AI, model sharing, data openness, and technological interoperability will all influence whether AI can form widespread industry applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-the-future-of-ai-is-full-of-possibilities-but-requires-more-refined-implementation&#34;&gt;Conclusion: The Future of AI is Full of Possibilities, but Requires More Refined Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant advancements in AI technology over the past two years, it remains in the stage of “lacking killer applications” at present. Similar to containerization technology before Docker’s release, AI needs a reasonable application scenario that deeply integrates existing technologies with business requirements to truly achieve large-scale adoption and widespread use. While technological innovation is important, solutions that simplify processes and improve efficiency are more likely to drive the popularization and development of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, AI may evolve like Docker – not through disruptive technological breakthroughs, but by integrating existing technologies to create a perfect application scenario, ultimately changing the way we work and live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Protobuf Zero Value Pitfalls: When Default Values Become an Invisible Killer of Business Logic</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/protobuf-zero-value-trap/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:26:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/protobuf-zero-value-trap/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The US stock market has three trading sessions: pre-market, live market, and post-market. The logic for pushing data – whether it’s full data or numerical increments – is optimized to conserve bandwidth (sending as little data as possible). Initially, only the full dataset is sent in the first transmission; subsequent transmissions are incremental updates of all fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not use the optimal solution? This involves multiple project teams, some of which have been live for many years. As we’re a new integration, we can only strive for compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-series-of-issues&#34;&gt;A Series of Issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just from the summary, it might seem like there aren&amp;rsquo;t any problems, but once the system architecture is brought in, a series of issues arise. Immediately after resolving the previous issue, a new one emerged – this problem was caused by the prior one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unable-to-identify-trading-intervals&#34;&gt;Unable to Identify Trading Intervals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market phase is defined in &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; as 0, but due to incremental push data delivery, the business side cannot effectively identify whether this &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; represents the default value or a genuine business value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms: Each time a &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; is received, it’s impossible to determine if it’s the new market phase setting or the &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; default value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introducing-optional&#34;&gt;Introducing Optional
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since protobuf release 3.15, proto3 supports using the optional keyword (just as in proto2) to provide presence information for a scalar field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group’s communication protocol is based on &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;, but due to historical reasons, the version selected was older and did not support the &lt;code&gt;optional&lt;/code&gt; keyword. As you know, because we introduced &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; from the ground up, publishing the project as a static library, this resulted in needing to upgrade the entire build chain, which was a very high cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gcc-version-issues&#34;&gt;GCC Version Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After painstakingly devising a solution, we planned to release two different underlying versions to control the propagation of dependencies for the new &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; version as much as possible. However, during compilation, we discovered that the &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version was too low and did not support the new features of &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commonly used server types in our team are CentOS7 and CentOS8. The default &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version on CentOS7 is 4.8, while the default &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version on CentOS8 is 8.3. Since the new features of &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; require a &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version of 7.4 or higher, CentOS7 could not support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=82461&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bug 82461 - [7 Regression] Temporary required for brace-initializing (non-literal-type) member variable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, after a lot of troubleshooting, we moved the deployments of related services and the compilation server to CentOS8, resolving this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reasonable-enumeration&#34;&gt;Reasonable Enumeration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the entire problem, there’s a simpler and more efficient solution: adjust the enumeration definition to start numbering from 1 instead of 0. This effectively distinguishes between default values and business values, avoiding all the aforementioned issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-starting-from-1-is-more-reasonable&#34;&gt;Why Starting from 1 is More Reasonable?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;, enum types have a default value fixed to 0. If we define meaningful business values as 0 (e.g., &amp;ldquo;Market Open&amp;rdquo;), in incremental pushes, the business side cannot determine whether the received 0 is a business value or an unset default value. However, if the enum starts from 1, 0 can be reserved for a meaningless default value or “Unknown” state, solving the problem directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended Practice:
When designing &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; enums, always define 0 as a meaningless default value (e.g., &lt;code&gt;UNKNOWN&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;RESERVED&lt;/code&gt;).
Assign actual business values starting from 1 to ensure they are distinguished from the default value of 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this small adjustment, we not only resolved the issue of identifying market hours but also provided a valuable lesson for future protocol design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Long time no see bull market in stocks</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/long-time-no-see-bull-market-in-stocks/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:42:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/long-time-no-see-bull-market-in-stocks/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the eve of the 2024 National Day holiday, China’s stock market experienced a remarkable surge, attracting considerable attention. However, following the holiday, the market unexpectedly turned to a dramatic plunge. This “polarization” of the stock market – a rollercoaster ride between soaring highs and plummeting lows – not only subjected investors to a thrilling yet nerve-wracking experience, but also prompted deep reflection within the market regarding policy, economic conditions, and fundamental market rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-national-day-stock-market-surge-a-policy-driven-frenzy&#34;&gt;Pre-National Day Stock Market Surge: A Policy-Driven Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the five trading days leading up to National Day, China’s stock market surged from a slump into “boiling mode.” On September 30th, the A-share market saw a full-scale rally with all indices hitting historic highs. The Shanghai Composite Index rose by 8.06%, the Shenzhen Component Index increased by 10.67%, and the Innovation Board China Advanced Index soared by 15.36%, while the STAR 50 Index achieved its largest single-day rise in history, jumping 22.84%. Market sentiment was extremely exuberant, with daily trading volumes across the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Northern Exchanges reaching RMB 2611.5 billion, a significant increase of RMB 11559 billion compared to the previous trading day. More than 5300 stocks on the main board rallied collectively, creating a “sea of red.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core driver behind this rally was the concentrated release of a series of unexpectedly positive policies by the government and the resulting changes in market expectations. On September 24th, the People’s Bank of China announced a cut in the reserve requirement ratio and interest rates, reducing existing mortgage loan interest rates and standardizing the minimum down payment ratios. The Politburo Standing Committee’s meeting on September 26th emphasized the need to intensify counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policy adjustments to boost capital markets and actively guide medium and long-term funds into the market. On September 30th, a series of real estate support policies were released. These measures conveyed the government&amp;rsquo;s determination to stabilize the market and promote growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-national-day-stock-market-plunge-calm-and-adjustment-after-the-frenzy&#34;&gt;Post-National Day Stock Market Plunge: Calm and Adjustment After the Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, market sentiment plummeted sharply after the National Day holiday. On October 8th, the A-share market opened strongly with nearly a limit-up rise, but following a significant high opening, the market experienced violent fluctuations before closing down. Since then, the market’s center of gravity has continuously shifted downwards, and as of October 16th, the Shanghai Composite Index rose and fell by more than 15%, cumulatively falling by over 470 points. From October 8th to 10th, core A-share indices all declined, with the Shenzhen Component Index down 6.21%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this plunge are multifaceted. On one hand, it was a digestion of risks accumulated from the rapid rise in the previous period; on the other hand, it was also related to adjustments in market expectations regarding policy. Some investors believed that the short-term effects of policies were already evident, but the long-term effects still needed to be observed. Furthermore, volatility in global markets also impacted A-shares. On October 9th, the Hang Seng Index fell by 9.41%, and A50 futures fell by 10.4%, further exacerbating market declines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflection-and-outlook-on-the-market&#34;&gt;Reflection and Outlook on the Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dramatic volatility in the stock market around National Day highlighted a deep reflection among investors regarding policy, economics, and market fundamentals. On one hand, the short-term stimulus effects of policies were significant, but their long-term impact remains to be observed. On the other hand, the rapid rise and fall of the market served as a reminder for investors to maintain rationality and avoid emotional investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, whether A-shares can usher in a genuine “long bull” trend depends on whether policy can effectively transmit to the real economy and ultimately drive substantive improvements in economic fundamentals. Investors should closely monitor the specific implementation of policies and changes in economic data to rationally adjust their investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp rises and falls in the stock market around National Day were a game between policy and the market, and also a test of investors’ mentality. In this “two-pronged” market environment, we saw the power of the market and the influence of policy. How the market will unfold in the future remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Background Service TCP Communication Anomaly Troubleshooting</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:54:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Business Model: The backend service establishes a connection with the group’s market data gateway using TCP. Each time a connection is established, it must first send an authorization request and then continuously send heartbeat packages to maintain the connection status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one day, an alert message was received indicating that the service had disconnected. After carefully examining the logs, it was discovered that the backend service was continuously sending heartbeat packages, but the other party did not respond at all, yet the connection remained open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;field-summary&#34;&gt;Field Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was originally working in the office, pushing project progress, when an alarm message suddenly popped up in the company group. At first glance, I thought it was just a recurring issue – likely due to network timeouts causing heartbeat failures, leading to service disconnection. However, after careful log examination, the actual situation turned out to be different. The backend had sent an authorization login message, but hadn’t received a response; meanwhile, heartbeat packets continued to send persistently, yet the other party never replied with any heartbeat data. After in-depth analysis of the logs, several key issues were exposed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Response to Authorization Message:&lt;/strong&gt; This was likely due to the other system being in the process of restarting, preventing the authorization message from being processed promptly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sending Heartbeat Data Without Successful Authorization:&lt;/strong&gt; Upon investigation, it was found that this was a logical flaw in the program’s logic. The heartbeat sending function&amp;rsquo;s judgment logic had a defect; it only checked the connection status but missed verifying the authorization status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Did Not Disconnect:&lt;/strong&gt; If the service could have disconnected, it would have triggered a reconnection mechanism and re-sent the authorization message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there’s one remaining critical issue that needs to be resolved – why didn&amp;rsquo;t the service disconnect? Solving this problem requires more in-depth and detailed troubleshooting work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analyzing-network-packets&#34;&gt;Analyzing Network Packets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; is a very powerful network packet capture tool that can be used to capture network packets. By analyzing network packets, we can gain a more intuitive understanding of the details of network communication. Here, we can use &lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; to capture network packets for further analysis.

		data-flex-basis=&#34;1337px&#34;
	
&gt;
Analyzing the data in the diagram, I see that the heartbeat is constantly being sent normally, and the other server did not respond with any data, but it sent an &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;, which prevents the connection from disconnecting proactively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;common-flag-bit-explanations&#34;&gt;Common Flag Bit Explanations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the TCP protocol, &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; (Push) and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; (Acknowledgment) are two important flag bits used to control data transmission and traffic confirmation, respectively. Their functions are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-psh-push-flag&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. PSH (Push Flag)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; flag’s purpose is to &lt;strong&gt;request that the receiver immediately push data from its buffer to the upper-layer application&lt;/strong&gt; (rather than waiting for the buffer to fill). This means that once a data segment with the &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; flag is received, the receiver will process and transmit it as quickly as possible to the application, rather than storing it in an operating system buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical Scenarios:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP/HTTPS Requests:&lt;/strong&gt; Clients setting the &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; when sending requests (e.g., &lt;code&gt;GET /index.html&lt;/code&gt;) to ensure immediate response from the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSH Protocol:&lt;/strong&gt; Each keystroke triggers a &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt;, ensuring real-time transmission of input characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Time Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; Low-latency scenarios like video streaming or online games may utilize &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; to reduce latency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; is not mandatory; the receiver can choose to ignore this flag (but still process the data normally).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sender may not set &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt;, in which case the receiver will determine when to push data based on its own buffering strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-ack-acknowledgment-flag&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. ACK (Acknowledgment Flag)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function:&lt;/strong&gt; The ACK flag indicates that &lt;strong&gt;the previous data segment has been correctly received&lt;/strong&gt;. Each ACK contains an acknowledgment number (Acknowledgment Number), which represents the next byte sequence expected to be received. It is the core mechanism of TCP reliable transmission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Principle:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the sender sends a data segment, it carries the expected ACK value from the receiver (e.g., &lt;code&gt;ACK = Sequence Number + Data Length&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon receiving the data, the receiver generates an ACK message to confirm the received byte sequence number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sender only retransmits unacknowledged data after receiving the corresponding ACK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the sender sends a data segment with sequence numbers &lt;code&gt;100~199&lt;/code&gt;, then the expected ACK from the receiver should be &lt;code&gt;200&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the receiver has not received some of the data in &lt;code&gt;100~199&lt;/code&gt;, it will inform the sender to retransmit via &lt;code&gt;ACK=150&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-combination-of-psh-and-ack&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Combination of PSH and ACK&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the TCP header, &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; can appear simultaneously, commonly seen in the following scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP Request Response&lt;/strong&gt;:
When a client sends a &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request (including data), it sets both &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; (to acknowledge previous responses).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command Transfer after SSH Handshake&lt;/strong&gt;:
After the client enters a command, it sends a data segment with &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; to ensure that the command is immediately transmitted and processed by the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-other-flagged-associations&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Other Flagged Associations&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;td&gt;SYN&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Synchronize&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Initiate connection (three-way handshake)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Reset&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Forcefully terminates the connection (exceptional circumstances)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-other-flagged-associations-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Other Flagged Associations&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Flag&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Brief Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;URG&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Urgent&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Marks an urgent pointer (rarely used)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-other-flagged-associations-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Other Flagged Associations&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSH&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on &lt;strong&gt;data arriving at the application layer as quickly as possible&lt;/strong&gt;, reducing latency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACK&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on &lt;strong&gt;reliable data transmission&lt;/strong&gt;, avoiding packet loss or out-of-order delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two work together to balance TCP protocol efficiency and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>“Making an investment and making money isn’t urgent, and getting anxious won’t help either.”</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:30:24 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on years of stock trading experiences, although I didn’t make a fortune, I also didn&amp;rsquo;t lose too much. The biggest issue was an unreasonable allocation of funds and an unstable mindset. Currently, my primary source of income is work, earning a fixed salary each day through part-time jobs, and my ability to withstand financial fluctuations remains at the level of bonds and bank deposits. However, people are inherently greedy; if you buy too little, even when prices rise, you won’t make money; and if you buy too much, you will lose money. At this point, maintaining a stable mindset is particularly important, as it can help us keep our wealth afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-loss-cases&#34;&gt;Historical Loss Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from when I first entered the market, I’ve encountered small-cap and near-new stocks. Later, my focus shifted to blue-chip large-cap stocks: Industrial Bank, China Unicom, Hisense Electronics, ZTESC, and various large index funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in blue chips is like aligning with “old money”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Evergrande’s problems arose, bank stocks plummeted alongside it, successfully identifying the exit point. This reflected a lack of understanding regarding the broader economic market; real estate accounted for too much of China&amp;rsquo;s economy, and the implications were too extensive to simply “land” – the subsequent continued decline in the stock market saw blue-chip stocks like Industrial Bank continue to rise for about two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the initial stages of the trade war, ZTESC suffered a severe blow, with its share price also falling dramatically. It has since gradually recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hisense Electronics is an old veteran; after Ant Financial withdrew, its stock price also plummeted significantly. However, this stock had a controlling shareholder manipulating it, and it could surge several times each year. With reasonable position sizing, you wouldn’t lose much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bond-investment&#34;&gt;Bond Investment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s just say it was a lucky outcome, essentially benefiting from falling interest rates. There were changes at my job in Hangzhou, leading me to abandon the idea of buying a house and liquidate my existing bank term deposits. I then focused on reinvesting previously held bonds, significantly increasing my bond investment ratio. Fortunately, interest rates have been declining for several years, allowing me to capitalize on the “bull market” in bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my six months back in Hangzhou, I had plenty of time to reflect and gain clarity. Real estate isn’t a necessity, nor is staying in a particular location – my ability to handle stress was thus improved. If I were to lose my job, the mortgage would be like a mountain to climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;investment-return-expectations&#34;&gt;Investment Return Expectations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The expected annualized oral commitment is comparable to a three-year fixed bank deposit,” but in reality, it’s greedy and wants more. From the initial frantic increase (adding positions), to later exhausting cash flow. Purchases of insurance, real estate, and weddings represent significant outflows of capital, and overall, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough capital flow left over, leading to insufficient funds later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subsequent plan is to long-term hold &lt;strong&gt;brokerage ETFs&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Hang Seng Tech Index&lt;/strong&gt;, with an asset allocation that still includes insurance as a base, medium-to-long term bonds, and stock funds.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Echoes of bygone years, offering unconventional fantasies and emotional solace.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 22:12:57 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the earliest web novel readers entered middle age, the type of “revenge” stories catered to them also evolved. The protagonists often appeared as fathers, mentors, or elderly figures, meeting the different needs and demands of middle-aged readers for life and emotion. These works no longer solely focused on upgrades and reversals; instead, they emphasized emotional resonance and life reflections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;target-audience-shifting-reader-base-amidst-the-passage-of-time&#34;&gt;Target Audience: Shifting Reader Base Amidst the Passage of Time
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former web novel readers have largely transitioned into middle age. They’ve experienced the trials and tribulations of life, leading to shifts in their mindset and values. The passionate, adventurous elements they once chased are no longer the sole focus for them. Instead, they seek emotional resonance with their current lives and a sense of nostalgia for past years, as well as aspirations for the future. Middle-aged爽文 (shuangwen - a popular genre) emerged specifically to meet this psychological need. It utilizes plot settings that closely align with the lives and attitudes of middle-aged readers, attracting this particular demographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;role-shift-from-young-hero-to-middle-aged-guardian&#34;&gt;Role Shift: From Young Hero to Middle-Aged Guardian
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Students Are All Villains:&lt;/strong&gt; The protagonist, Lu Zhou, after becoming a master, faces a group of disciples with diverse personalities and formidable strength. They teeter between good and evil, and Lu Zhou needs to guide them towards the right path. This novel showcases the challenges and confusion faced by middle-aged individuals when educating the next generation through interactions with their disciples. Furthermore, the growth and transformation of the disciples offer hope and a glimpse into the future, mirroring expectations for one’s children or younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emotional-resonance-life-reflections-and-family-responsibilities&#34;&gt;Emotional Resonance: Life Reflections and Family Responsibilities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sixty-Year-Old Birthday System:&lt;/strong&gt; The protagonist gained a system upon turning sixty, embarking on a new life journey. This setting allows middle-aged readers to feel a sense of “it’s never too late” hope and inspiration. Even having reached old age, the protagonist can still realize their value and dreams through the system. This plot encourages readers to reflect on missed opportunities and unfulfilled dreams in their own lives, while also conveying an optimistic attitude, encouraging them not to give up pursuing their goals at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-design-aligning-with-the-rhythm-and-humor-of-middle-age-life&#34;&gt;Plot Design: Aligning with the Rhythm and Humor of Middle Age Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot designs for middle-aged “revenge” novels often place a greater emphasis on the details of life and the nuanced expression of emotions. Unlike young adult revenge novels that prioritize rapid upgrades and adventures, they focus more on relationships between characters and emotional entanglements. For example, in &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Master Craftsman&lt;/em&gt;, the protagonist’s friendship with his apprentice, their brotherhood with fellow disciples, etc., are all depicted in detail. This plot design allows middle-aged readers to feel a sense of warmth and familiarity, as if they were seeing their own family relationships, friendships, and love lives.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ollama local deployment of deepseek-R1</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ollama-local-deployment-deepseek-r1/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:41:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ollama-local-deployment-deepseek-r1/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ollama is an open-source AI tool designed to enable users to run and deploy large language models (LLMs) locally. Its goal is to provide a convenient and efficient way for developers to use models like GPT on their local machines without relying on cloud services. Ollama supports multiple models and focuses on optimizing performance, allowing even resource-constrained devices to smoothly run these models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Ollama, users can utilize text-based AI applications and interact with locally deployed models without worrying about data privacy or high API usage fees. You can invoke different models via a command-line interface (CLI) for tasks such as natural language processing and question answering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ollama is suitable for experimenting with various models; after testing the Windows version, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t fully leverage the hardware’s performance, possibly due to the Windows version. When deploying 32b parameter models, with low memory and GPU load, the response speed is slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hardware-overview&#34;&gt;Hardware Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating System: Windows 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU: i7-10700K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory: 40GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics Card: RTX 3060 12GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;environment-setup&#34;&gt;Environment Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the system environment variable to facilitate subsequent use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_MODELS=E:\ollama&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
This variable specifies the location where Ollama models are stored. &lt;code&gt;E:\ollama&lt;/code&gt; is a folder path indicating that all local model files will be stored in this directory. Ollama will load and use the language models you download or deploy based on this path. You can store model files in other locations by simply changing this path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:8000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
This environment variable sets the host and port for the Ollama service.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; is the localhost address, meaning the Ollama service will only listen for requests from the local machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;8000&lt;/code&gt; is the specified port number, indicating that the Ollama service will wait for and process requests on port 8000. You can change the port number if needed, but make sure it&amp;rsquo;s not already in use by another application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
This environment variable controls which origins are allowed to access the Ollama service.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; indicates that all origins (i.e., all domains and IP addresses) can access the Ollama service. This is typically used in development and debugging environments, and in production environments, it&amp;rsquo;s usually necessary to specify stricter origin control, limiting only specific domains or IPs to access your service for enhanced security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deepseek-r1-model-deployment&#34;&gt;DeepSeek-R1 Model Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ollama installation is straightforward, so we won&amp;rsquo;t detail it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-installation verification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;C:\Users\core&amp;gt;ollama -v
ollama version is 0.5.11
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deploy the model, refer to the official model page and select the appropriate parameter model: &lt;code&gt;ollama run deepseek-r1:14b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 14b parameter version effectively remembers conversation context; smaller parameter versions cannot retain context. The 32b parameter version is very sluggish when deployed locally and hasn&amp;rsquo;t been further tested.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;“I’d gotten used to using zsh on Linux, and when I was writing a blog post the other day, I suddenly realized that PowerShell 7 also supports persistent command-line prediction views, so I tried it out. It turned out to be pretty useful after all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I did to enable this feature, but it just appeared—that’s all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;powershell-7-a-powerful-tool-across-platforms&#34;&gt;PowerShell 7: A Powerful Tool Across Platforms
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;cross-platform-features&#34;&gt;Cross-Platform Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 breaks down platform limitations, allowing you to perform enterprise-level server management on Windows systems, system administration in Linux environments, or daily development tasks on macOS – all with a unified PowerShell 7 tool. This significantly increases productivity and reduces the learning curve and operational complexity associated with platform differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;powerful-features&#34;&gt;Powerful Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It possesses powerful scripting capabilities, supporting object-oriented programming, functions, modules, and other advanced programming features. Through PowerShell 7, users can easily operate the file system, create, delete, copy, move, and perform other operations on files and folders; it can access and modify the registry to deeply adjust system configurations; it can manage processes and services to effectively monitor and control the system&amp;rsquo;s running status. Furthermore, PowerShell 7 can interact with various Windows and non-Windows technologies, such as user and permission management in Active Directory and resource allocation and management on the Azure cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-source-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Open Source Ecosystem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 is open source, a feature that allows developers and enthusiasts worldwide to actively participate in its development and improvement. A large number of open-source modules and tools are constantly emerging, enriching the functionality and application scenarios of PowerShell 7. Users can find suitable modules within the open-source community to extend the capabilities of PowerShell 7 or contribute their own code to drive the overall development of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compatibility-and-stability&#34;&gt;Compatibility and Stability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 maintains compatibility with older versions of PowerShell while introducing many new features and improvements. These enhancements not only improve performance but also increase stability, allowing users to complete various tasks more smoothly and reducing disruptions caused by software failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enable-command-line-prediction-view&#34;&gt;Enable Command-Line Prediction View
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the many useful features of PowerShell 7, the &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt; command is a practical tool that enhances the user&amp;rsquo;s command-line input experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the command itself isn’t necessary to achieve auto-completion, it only provides in-line completion; once enabled, it allows for prediction view, displaying all possible completion options in a list format. Users can then select the desired option using the up and down arrow keys, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of command input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;methods-to-make-commands-persistent&#34;&gt;Methods to Make Commands Persistent
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt; command takes effect every time PowerShell starts, we can add it to PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s profile. A PowerShell profile is a special script that automatically executes its commands when PowerShell launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;determine-configuration-file-path&#34;&gt;Determine Configuration File Path
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In PowerShell, we can use the &lt;code&gt;$PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; variable to view the path of the configuration file. If the file does not exist under that path, users can manually create one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;echo $PROFILE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-configuration-file&#34;&gt;Open Configuration File
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a text editor, such as the powerful Notepad++ or the lightweight Visual Studio Code, to open the file corresponding to the configuration file path obtained through the &lt;code&gt;$PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-command&#34;&gt;Add Command
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the opened configuration file, add the command &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt;. Ensure that the command is written accurately to guarantee that the configuration file takes effect correctly when executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;save-configuration&#34;&gt;Save Configuration
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adding the command, save the configuration file and close the text editor. At this point, the configuration file contains the commands we want to execute every time PowerShell starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;verification-settings&#34;&gt;Verification Settings
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the current PowerShell window and restart PowerShell. In the newly launched PowerShell, when entering commands, the command-line input prediction view style should already be displayed in list view according to our settings, indicating that our settings have been successfully applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these steps, we not only gained a deeper understanding of the powerful features and characteristics of PowerShell 7 but also learned how to use the command-line input prediction view style to enhance the user experience, and how to make these settings persistent. We hope this knowledge can help you operate PowerShell 7 more confidently and efficiently complete various system management and automation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Modern Monetary Theory the future of global economies?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/modern-monetary-theory-future-global-economy/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 23:16:34 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/modern-monetary-theory-future-global-economy/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The U.S. stock market’s sustained bull run is largely driven by the “watering” of the dollar, rather than America’s inherent “hard power.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The modern monetary system has gradually become an important theoretical cornerstone for many economies worldwide since the 2008 financial crisis, emphasizing the subjective initiative of large governments in intervening in markets and utilizing government fiscal deficits as a primary tool to achieve full employment while stabilizing inflation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;large government&amp;rdquo; is most commonly associated with Keynesianism, which highlights the government’s role in “smoothing peaks and troughs” during economic cycles – for example, suppressing overheating and stimulating contraction. It places great emphasis on the multiplier effect of government spending, i.e., how much an increase in monetary stimulus can amplify consumer multipliers; a 1-unit increase in government expenditure stimulates an equivalent increase in corporate and individual income, leading to business expansion and job creation, and ultimately mitigating economic downturns.  Furthermore, it adopts a relatively conservative approach to fiscal deficit limits and sustainability. The multiplier effect will drive market recovery, thereby increasing government revenue, especially during periods of overheating, where government debt potential and interest rate levels can be accumulated as stimulus funds for the next cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The modern monetary system is more like an extreme extension of Keynesianism, but with differences; its biggest characteristic is the limitation on government debt, which means the central bank should not have independent autonomy, primarily focused on inflation and full employment.  With limited resources and productivity, inflation refers to the government continuously increasing purchasing power through unlimited fiscal deficits as technological progress improves production efficiency, until it reaches the ideal level of full employment and production bottlenecks; continuing to increase monetary supply will lead to inflation, at which point it chooses to set a limit on fiscal deficits, as long as there are idle production resources, increased debt will not trigger inflation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-financial-crisis&#34;&gt;After the Financial Crisis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, reality is not an ideal world, and execution in each stage involves human participation. Keynesianism is also selectively applied, leading to more economic stimulus during downturns and less overheating suppression. Economic imbalances generate achievements, while overheating also does, making it extremely difficult to suppress them. The numerous economic problems brought about, even a new financial crisis, are not inferior to the economic shocks caused by traditional overcapacity. The 2008 global financial crisis was actually a market self-reinforcement resulting from extreme Keynesianism, leading to the proliferation of speculative structural financial investment products such as real estate and financial investment products derived from real estate as their underlying assets. Even before the crisis erupted, there was a lack of risk awareness at academic, political, and market levels, treating debt-fueled prosperity as achievements, and more people benefited from it, such as the enormous financial system: losses are yours, dividends are ours, it’s bankruptcy – we made a fortune, money cannot be spat out. Ultimately, this led to massive investment by participants, bearing the profits of previous stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, the shadow of the modern monetary system entered the financial crisis, characterized by rapid monetization of fiscal deficits and central banks&amp;rsquo; unlimited quantitative easing, as well as so-called emergency central bank lending policies. As the final lender, the central bank supplied bullets endlessly, allowing governments to continue borrowing debt. The central bank coordinated with fiscal policy, supporting government fiscal deficit spending through methods such as purchasing bonds, ensuring consistency of policy objectives. This is also why the boundaries between modern monetary and fiscal policies are becoming increasingly blurred – the base money injection relies heavily on the central bank’s direct participation in bond purchases, with one hand printing money and the other buying bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eurozone and the United States exhibited similar trends. In 2008, the EU government debt was approximately €6.7 trillion, and the government leverage ratio was around 66%, slightly above the generally recognized warning line of 60%. By 2014 – the five years of saving the market – the debt scale reached €9.5 trillion, and the leverage rose to 93%. The United States was even more exaggerated: in 2008, US government debt was approximately $10 trillion, reaching about $18 trillion by 2014, and recently again raising the government debt ceiling. Of course, each farce is staged with a government shutdown, but it will always break through the government debt limit. Currently exceeding $36 trillion, compared to $26 trillion growth in 2008, considering GDP growth factors, the government leverage has grown from 60% to over 120%. The Federal Reserve, as the final lender, played an important role in multiple rescue operations and is one of the main purchasers of government debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flaws-and-limitations-of-the-modern-monetary-system&#34;&gt;Flaws and Limitations of the Modern Monetary System
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This government-led stimulus scheme, though not a planned economy, faces consistent problems. How can you guarantee the market’s omniscience and all participants’ selfless dedication at every stage? Let&amp;rsquo;s take a simple example: if a government department increases its budget for a particular direction by 1 million, is it going to go to the mayor’s nephew or a more cost-effective market auction? Of course, in reality, interests will form in increasingly complex ways, leading to the result that even though the government has expanded debt and spending, it flows completely out of control. The recent American establishment of a Government Accountability Office is an extension of this type of problem. These issues manifest differently across varying corrupt economies; we’re focusing on discussing the more prevalent problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-inflation-issues&#34;&gt;1. Inflation Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the development of the modern information network, governments have a much greater grasp on market information than in the past, but this is not omniscience; markets inherently contain variables and are always subject to change based on expectations, leading to nested loops (or “Russian dolls”). I anticipate your predictions. Taking actual performance as an example, while between 2008 and 2020, the practice of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) performed well, achieving short-term economic recovery and inflation stabilization – even the Eurozone experienced phase-wise deflation, and U.S. inflation remained roughly within the expected 1-3% range, leading people to believe in extreme tools like Keynesianism again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we look back, it was primarily due to continued high growth in manufacturing in developing countries after 2008, such as our country gradually securing its position as a global production base and Southeast Asian and Indian economies following suit, all maintaining relatively high industrial value added, which offset the biggest limitation of MMT – resource supply constraints. Even under de-industrialization and excessive financialization in Europe and America, they simultaneously experienced increased government debt and monetary supply surges, while maintaining relatively stable inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after 2020, with the use of larger-scale stimulus policies, both the Eurozone and the United States saw more significant inflation, peaking at around 10% – even today, despite rising interest rates for nearly three years, the U.S. labor market continues to exhibit abnormal overheating, and financial markets experience divergence from economic growth supported by monetary support, with inflation running towards 3% as the base effect disappears. This overheating performance during rate hikes is closely related to fiscal deficits. Raising interest rates is a contractionary monetary policy, while fiscal policy remains expansionary, compounded by the ultra-massive money injection in 2020, which has made U.S. inflation remarkably persistent. The biggest limitation of MMT is high inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-government-debt-issues&#34;&gt;2. Government Debt Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In principle, governments can indefinitely finance debt repayment through borrowing, but this is only possible if &lt;strong&gt;the central bank becomes a complete puppet&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning full alignment of monetary and fiscal policy – a key element of modern monetary systems known as &lt;strong&gt;policy coherence&lt;/strong&gt;. The Federal Reserve has no intention of granting the government completely unfettered authority, especially considering the accumulated government debt balance over many years, particularly interest expenses, which are increasingly becoming a significant burden on finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal Year 2023: In fiscal year 2023, the United States generated $4.439 trillion in revenue. The proportion of interest payments on its debt to this revenue was approximately 15%.  In 2024, this high-interest environment continued, according to data released by the U.S. Treasury Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal Year 2024: The U.S. federal government’s budget deficit reached $1.833 trillion, with net interest payments on debt totaling $882 billion – approximately 18% of U.S. revenue. This even exceeded Social Security expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This highlights the sustainability issues within fiscal policy. If persistently maintained at low interest rates and low inflation, high levels of debt (such as in Japan) could theoretically lead to a slow, incremental increase under a quasi-modern monetary system.  According to the 72 rule, if interest costs are sufficiently low, debt repayment can double over 72 years – assuming inflation breaks this delicate balance, the accumulation of interest payments on debt will lead to runaway debt levels, with principal becoming a secondary factor. If the central bank subsequently diverges from the government’s objectives, these issues will become even more acute.  Furthermore, Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s political agenda starkly contrasted with the current Federal Reserve&amp;rsquo;s hawkish stance, contributing significantly to tensions between the U.S. government and the Fed during his term. The primary focus of observers is whether the current chairman can successfully complete his term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-financial-bubbles-and-monetary-credit-issues&#34;&gt;3. Financial Bubbles and Monetary Credit Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, government-expanded spending enters the household and corporate sectors, leading everyone to expand their spending, thereby boosting the increase in effective demand. However, given that people are all experienced from numerous financial bubbles since 2000, it’s clear that investment and consumption choices will exhibit a strong tendency towards large investment appreciation, especially when one or more products with extremely high expected appreciation appear, people will flock to the financial market seeking higher appreciation, even willing to compress living standards and leverage up. This is similar to what happened in Japan, the United States, and China during periods of high real estate growth. Combined with policy stimulus and the pursuit of maximum self-interest by practitioners, issues such as subprime loans are rampant. Many so-called bailout policies are actually encouraging borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, historical performance shows an astonishing consistency: when monetary and fiscal policies are deployed on a large scale, it often leads to &lt;strong&gt;asset bubbles and wealth redistribution frenzies&lt;/strong&gt;. The asset bubble comes first, followed by wealth redistribution. This results in another problem – the extreme Keynesianism or Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) frequently encountered – leading to economic Ponzi schemes (Minsky Moment). As long as there is hot money, asset prices continue to rise; as long as they keep rising, latercomers will flock to hold cash; while the CPI measuring changes in basic living expenses doesn&amp;rsquo;t change significantly, money circulates within specific areas, and latercomers have no way out. &lt;strong&gt;After the frenzy comes the collapse&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the judgment of the Minsky Moment – repeatedly proven effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, currency itself has a supply and demand relationship. When market supply exceeds demand, traditional investment products cannot accommodate it, or when it harvests too much capital that cannot attract investment, such as repeated real estate bubbles (Japanese people haven&amp;rsquo;t dared to touch real estate investments for decades), tax policies like increasing property holding taxes to reduce speculative demand will increase the cost of financial speculation. In a situation of excessive monetary supply, the market urgently needs investment-and-tax-exempt investment products, and various virtual investment products emerge accordingly, even including the US President and First Lady joining in. One saying is to dig into the dollar, but it’s actually the inevitable result of global currency issuance and financial circulation under the damage of fiat currency credit. MMT relies most on countries with monopoly rights over credit money, which are also challenged. What kind of soil breeds what kind of financial game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) and Keynesianism are more like a progression and replacement relationship, emphasizing greater government intervention in the market and adopting a more aggressive attitude towards fiscal deficits and central bank independence. Excessive use of Keynesianism leads to stagflation and financial crises; MMT quietly took over after 2008 to clear out this artificially overheated economy. Under global economic globalization, productivity continues to improve, it quickly restored growth in the short term while maintaining inflation levels in the country using it, but also accumulated large government debt and asset bubbles. When inflation rebounded, with inconsistent goals between the central bank and the government, high interest rates and high leverage coexist, further exacerbating the fiscal burden brought about by government bond issuance. Fiscal sustainability is significantly weakened. Furthermore, excessive government participation has led to monetary base expansion, creating asset bubbles, while unlimited printing of money weakens the creditworthiness of the currency itself. It may appear that the dollar is strong, but it’s just a reflection of others. The massive investment demand creates fertile ground for various new types of financial investment and speculative tools, even escaping tax restrictions on traditional financial investment products – this is a microcosm of the global economy. MMT may not be the future, but it&amp;rsquo;s more like the past used after 2008, superimposed on the decline of economic globalization, the larger the financial bubble blown by governments, the higher the accumulated government debt, and the more frantic the financial speculative tools, the higher the efficiency of distorting wealth allocation. The greater the risk of a hard landing – including economic and social risks. Whether it’s Keynesianism or MMT, no matter how much monetary supply is provided, it cannot truly solve the problem of wealth structure; instead, it exacerbates risks in asset bubbles and Ponzi schemes. People are repeatedly falling into the same pit in different postures, but never learn anything from it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding “buy rate” and “sell rate” in exchange rates</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-buy-and-sell-exchange-rates/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 22:32:10 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-buy-and-sell-exchange-rates/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the foreign exchange market, particularly at banks or currency exchange points, we often see terms like “buy rate” and “sell rate.” Many people may not be clear about these concepts, or even confuse them. Today, let’s help everyone understand the meaning of these rates and their functions through a simple example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-what-are-buy-rate-and-sell-rate&#34;&gt;1. What are “Buy Rate” and “Sell Rate”?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The bank or currency exchange institution is willing to purchase foreign currencies at this rate, meaning when you sell your foreign currency (such as US dollars) to the bank, the bank will pay you RMB according to the buy rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The bank or currency exchange institution is willing to sell foreign currencies at this rate, meaning when you buy foreign currency with RMB, the bank will sell you the foreign currency at the sell rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The price at which the bank buys foreign currency from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The price at which the bank sells foreign currency to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the buy and sell rates of banks are usually different, and the sell rate is generally higher than the buy rate. This difference is the source of profit for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-specific-case-analysis&#34;&gt;2. Specific Case Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help everyone better understand the practical application of these exchange rates, let’s look at a specific example:
Assume you go to a bank to exchange dollars, and the bank provides the following exchange rate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 US Dollar = 7.0 RMB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 US Dollar = 7.2 RMB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-1-you-sell-us-dollars-to-a-bank&#34;&gt;Scenario 1: You Sell US Dollars to a Bank
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume you have $1,000 USD and want to sell these dollars to a bank. The bank will calculate the transaction using the buying rate:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
1000 \, \text{USD} \times 7.0 \, \text{CNY/USD} = 7000 \, \text{CNY}
\]
&lt;p&gt;This means the bank will give you 7,000 CNY. The exchange rate is the &lt;strong&gt;buying rate&lt;/strong&gt; because you are selling USD to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-two-you-buy-us-dollars-with-renminbi&#34;&gt;Scenario Two: You Buy US Dollars with Renminbi
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assume you have 7,000 RMB and want to exchange it for US dollars. The bank will calculate the amount in USD based on the selling rate:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
7000 \, \text{RMB} \div 7.2 \, \text{RMB/USD} = 972.22 \, \text{USD}
\]
&lt;p&gt;In this case, you can exchange 7,000 RMB for approximately 972.22 USD. The exchange rate here is the &lt;strong&gt;selling rate&lt;/strong&gt;, because you are purchasing US dollars from the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-why-buying-and-selling-currency-differ&#34;&gt;3. Why Buying and Selling Currency Differ?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that a bank’s buying rate (7.0 RMB/USD) is lower than its selling rate (7.2 RMB/USD). This is because banks typically profit from this exchange rate spread when engaging in foreign exchange transactions. In other words, banks earn profits by charging a higher selling rate and paying a lower buying rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the above case, the bank’s spread is:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
\text{Selling Rate} (7.2) - \text{Buying Rate} (7.0) = 0.2 \, RMB
\]
&lt;p&gt;This difference in price is the source of the bank&amp;rsquo;s profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-summary&#34;&gt;4. Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The bank buys foreign currency from you at this rate (the same rate you sold the foreign currency for).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selling Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The bank sells foreign currency to you at this rate (the same rate you bought the foreign currency for).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exchange Rate Difference:&lt;/strong&gt; The difference between the buying and selling rates is the bank’s profit margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these two rate concepts allows us to clearly know how much foreign currency we will receive, or how much Renminbi we need to spend to buy foreign currency when conducting foreign exchange. We hope this simple example helps everyone better understand the basic principles of foreign exchange rates!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visual Studio loading a mismatched PDB file</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-load-unmatched-pdb/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 20:04:33 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-load-unmatched-pdb/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When debugging programs under Windows using Visual Studio, if the PDB file does not match the executable file, Visual Studio will display &amp;ldquo;Unable to load symbol file.&amp;rdquo; The program crashes and generates a crash dump. If it&amp;rsquo;s an mismatched PDB file, Visual Studio cannot smoothly enter the crash site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-pdb-file&#34;&gt;What is a PDB File?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PDB file is a debugging information file created by Microsoft, used for debugging programs. It contains information such as the symbol table, source code filenames, line numbers, and other debugging data. A PDB file can be generated during program compilation to aid in debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;windbg-debugging&#34;&gt;WinDbg Debugging
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WinDbg is a debugging tool from Microsoft that can be used to debug Windows programs. WinDbg can load mismatched PDB files, but this requires manual loading. The &lt;code&gt;.reload /f /i&lt;/code&gt; command forces the loading of mismatched PDB files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, WinDbg is less convenient to use than Visual Studio, so we want Visual Studio to also be able to load mismatched PDB files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio-cannot-load-matching-pdb-files&#34;&gt;Visual Studio Cannot Load Matching PDB Files
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source code is now generally managed through Git, allowing you to find the corresponding version of the code and recompile it to generate matching PDB files. Why can’t they be loaded? The main reason is that metadata doesn&amp;rsquo;t match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a small tool that can modify metadata, generating a new PDB file based on the EXE file information so that Visual Studio can load it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChkMatch download address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.debuginfo.com/tools/chkmatch.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

Site cache address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;chkmatch.zip&#34; &gt;chkmatch.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;The ChkMatch utility can be used to check whether an executable and debug information file match. It can also be used to enforce matching between an executable and a debug information file if they are compatible.

For more information about debug information matching and related issues, see this article.

Supported debug information formats: DBG, PDB 2.0, PDB 7.0.

chkmatch [-c ExeFile DebugInfoFile ] |
         [-m ExeFile DebugInfoFile]
-c
Check matching between the executable and the debug information file.
-m
Make the executable and the debug information file match.
ExeFile
The name of the executable file.
DebugInfoFile
The name of the debug information file.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-chkmatch&#34;&gt;Using chkmatch
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, perform the check operation to analyze the cause of mismatches and prompt signature mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cursor AI Programming IDE Trial</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cursor-ai-programming-ide-trial/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 19:30:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cursor-ai-programming-ide-trial/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like another year has passed, and the biggest change at work is a significant increase in AI participation. Previously, switching between different development languages required developers to be familiar with various language-specific API interfaces. Now, these basic code snippets can all be generated by AI, which is a huge blessing for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chatgpt&#34;&gt;ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As early as 2023, I’ve written two simple introductory articles about it. Now it&amp;rsquo;s been 25 years – how to put this… I haven’t felt a significant improvement. It still needs to develop its own cognition, be able to reasonably break down tasks, and, of course, most importantly, identify whether AI-generated code contains bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-copilot&#34;&gt;Github Copilot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a long time ago, but I saw some information saying that Singapore deployed the server and it’s available for use in China. No longer need to maintain a VPN connection for extended periods. Of course, when logging in, you still need to connect to a VPN, but this VPN only needs to be used during login, and then you can turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In daily use, Github Copilot is also heavily relied upon. This plugin can be directly used in VS Code and Visual Studio without switching between the two applications. Compared to ChatGPT, Github Copilot provides better support for projects, is more user-friendly in interaction, and allows you to feed partial local files to it – &lt;strong&gt;“training” the AI&lt;/strong&gt; – so that the generated code is more aligned with your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cursor-ai&#34;&gt;Cursor AI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve seen a new AI programming IDE, Cursor AI. This IDE is based on Github Copilot, but this IDE is more intelligent and can help you create files directly.
I tried it briefly and found it to be pretty good, but its understanding of existing projects isn&amp;rsquo;t quite there yet. When working with large local project files, or for major refactoring, optimization, and adjustments, developers still need to &lt;strong&gt;break down tasks&lt;/strong&gt;.
Here’s an example: Switching to Cursor’s engineering mode, inputting the following content: “Create a personal resume webpage, supporting multiple different styles switching, and remember to fill in some personal information for data display.”
After several back-and-forths (&lt;strong&gt;pulling&lt;/strong&gt;), you can get the following webpage. Of course, this webpage is relatively simple, but it’s still pretty good for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, registered users can enjoy a free trial of 150 advanced APIs, while paying users are limited to 5000 advanced APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cursor-ai-1&#34;&gt;Cursor AI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/cursor/index.html&#34; &gt;Resume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>C&#43;&#43; Bitwise Operations Fundamentals: Bitwise Extraction and Flag Setting</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-bitwise-operations-flags/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 02:23:56 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-bitwise-operations-flags/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In actual C++ development, bitwise operations are a common technique, especially when dealing with system states, flags, or control bits. Bitwise operations can provide very efficient solutions. This article will illustrate how to use bitwise operations to retrieve and set specific flags through an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bitwise-operations-fundamentals&#34;&gt;Bitwise Operations Fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In computers, data is stored in binary bits (0 and 1). Bitwise operations are operations performed on these binary bits. C++ provides several commonly used bitwise operators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise AND (&amp;amp;)&lt;/strong&gt;: Used to check if a particular bit is set to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise OR (|)&lt;/strong&gt;: Used to set a particular bit to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise XOR (^)&lt;/strong&gt;: Used to flip a particular bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise NOT (~)&lt;/strong&gt;: Inverts all the bits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left Shift (&amp;laquo;)&lt;/strong&gt;: Shifts all bits to the left by a specified number of positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right Shift (&amp;raquo;)&lt;/strong&gt;: Shifts all bits to the right by a specified number of positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we need to perform a series of bitwise operations on an &lt;code&gt;unsigned short&lt;/code&gt; variable &lt;code&gt;wInfo&lt;/code&gt; to represent different states using various flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mermaid&#34;&gt;flowchart LR
    A[Original Value: 00010000] --&amp;gt; B[Left Shift: 00010000 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1]
    B --&amp;gt; C[Result: 00100000]
    C --&amp;gt; D[Right Shift: 00100000 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1]
    D --&amp;gt; E[Result: 00010000]

    subgraph Left Shift Operation
        direction LR
        A --&amp;gt; B --&amp;gt; C
    end

    subgraph Right Shift Operation
        direction LR
        C --&amp;gt; D --&amp;gt; E
    end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirement-analysis&#34;&gt;Requirement Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the description, we have a 16-bit flag to represent different states. These states are represented by various binary bits, with each binary bit corresponding to a specific meaning. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit0&lt;/strong&gt;: Failure status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit1&lt;/strong&gt;: Compression status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit2&lt;/strong&gt;: Incremental status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit3&lt;/strong&gt;: Presence of subsequent packets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit5&lt;/strong&gt;: Normal request or cancellation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-bitwise-operations&#34;&gt;Using Bitwise Operations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will use bitwise operations to set and retrieve these flags. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise AND:&lt;/strong&gt; Retrieve the value of a particular bit (0 or 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise OR:&lt;/strong&gt; Set a particular bit to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise XOR:&lt;/strong&gt; Set a particular bit to 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first define an &lt;code&gt;unsigned short&lt;/code&gt; type variable &lt;code&gt;wInfo&lt;/code&gt; to store these flags. Then, we use bitwise operations to check and set the corresponding flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;c-example-code&#34;&gt;C++ Example Code
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;bitset&amp;gt;

// Define flag constants
const unsigned short BIT_0_FAIL = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0;    // bit0 failed?
const unsigned short BIT_1_COMPRESSED = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1; // bit1 compressed?
const unsigned short BIT_2_INCREMENT = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2;  // bit2 incremented?
const unsigned short BIT_3_HAS_MORE = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 3;   // bit3 has more packets?
const unsigned short BIT_5_CANCEL = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 5;     // bit5 normal request(0) or cancel(1)

// Check if a bit is set
bool isBitSet(unsigned short wInfo, unsigned short bitMask) {
    return (wInfo &amp;amp; bitMask) != 0;
}

// Set a bit to 1
void setBit(unsigned short&amp;amp; wInfo, unsigned short bitMask) {
    wInfo |= bitMask;
}

// Clear a bit (set it to 0)
void clearBit(unsigned short&amp;amp; wInfo, unsigned short bitMask) {
    wInfo &amp;amp;= ~bitMask;
}

int main() {
    // Assume wInfo&#39;s initial value is 0
    unsigned short wInfo = 0;

    // Set bit0 (failure flag)
    setBit(wInfo, BIT_0_FAIL);
    
    // Set bit1 (compressed flag)
    setBit(wInfo, BIT_1_COMPRESSED);
    
    // Print wInfo&#39;s binary value
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;wInfo (in binary): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::bitset&amp;lt;16&amp;gt;(wInfo) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

    // Check each flag
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit0 (failed?): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_0_FAIL) ? &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit1 (compressed?): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_1_COMPRESSED) ? &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit2 (incremented?): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_2_INCREMENT) ? &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit3 (has more packets?): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_3_HAS_MORE) ? &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit5 (canceled?): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_5_CANCEL) ? &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

    // Clear bit1 (compressed flag)
    clearBit(wInfo, BIT_1_COMPRESSED);
    
    // Print the updated wInfo
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Updated wInfo (in binary): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::bitset&amp;lt;16&amp;gt;(wInfo) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the code, recommended for old friends: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wandbox.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://wandbox.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;wInfo (in binary): 0000000000000001
bit0 (failed?): yes
bit1 (compressed?): no
bit2 (incremented?): no
bit3 (has more packets?): no
bit5 (canceled?): no
Updated wInfo (in binary): 0000000000000000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;code-explanation&#34;&gt;Code Explanation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flag Definition&lt;/strong&gt;: Use shift operations (&lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; n&lt;/code&gt;) to define each flag bit. For example, &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to &lt;code&gt;bit0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to &lt;code&gt;bit1&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. This way, we allocate a unique binary position for each flag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check a Bit&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;isBitSet&lt;/code&gt; function uses the bitwise AND operation (&lt;code&gt;wInfo &amp;amp; bitMask&lt;/code&gt;) to check if a specific flag is set to 1. If the bit is 1, the function returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise it returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a Bit&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;setBit&lt;/code&gt; function uses the bitwise OR operation (&lt;code&gt;wInfo |= bitMask&lt;/code&gt;) to set a specific flag bit to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear a Bit&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;clearBit&lt;/code&gt; function uses the bitwise AND operation (&lt;code&gt;wInfo &amp;amp;= ~bitMask&lt;/code&gt;) to clear a specific flag bit to 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through bitwise operations, we can efficiently handle multiple state flags. This technique is particularly useful in practical development. For example, in embedded development, network protocols, and system status management scenarios, bit flags are often used to represent multiple binary states, saving space and improving efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this blog post helps you understand how to use bitwise operations in C++ to perform bitwise selection and setting, and mastering these skills is very helpful for writing efficient and maintainable code!&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:37:52 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/desktop-upgrade-to-2-5g-network-card-accelerates-local-area-network-interconnection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Desktop hardware three-in-one, in the previous text we mentioned PCIe adapter for solid state drives, where did the old SSDs go? Of course there was no waste, were any of them broken, disassembled and installed on the newly purchased ‘MechMaker Mini-3765H’ (bought a year ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new machine has powerful hardware specifications: 2.5G dual network interface, PCIe4.0, WiFi6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently moved house and my room doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a dedicated router for networking, all the machines are connected via wireless network; the ASUS motherboard desktop wireless card performance wasn’t great, or perhaps it was the router’s wireless access, which resulted in slow upload speeds between local networks, leading to poor network speeds between the machines. I purchased a 2.5G NIC and installed it on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus, all the slots on the motherboard are now full: graphics card, wireless card, 2.5G NIC, PCIe adapter for solid state drives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;network-instructions&#34;&gt;Network Instructions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both machines connect to the internet using their original wireless network cards, but are directly connected via Ethernet cables between the two, with both ends equipped with 2.5G network cards.  The specifics of how to physically connect the cables aren&amp;rsquo;t detailed here – numerous tutorials are available online; just remember to disable your firewall. You can select either machine as the gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mermaid&#34;&gt;graph TD;

        <title>ASUS Z490 motherboard has too many disks, resulting in intermittent disk unrecognition.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/asus-z490-motherboard-disk-recognition-issues/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:08:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/asus-z490-motherboard-disk-recognition-issues/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the previous text, an issue suddenly arose where the wireless network card was unable to be recognized. Before rebuilding the partitions, I had also researched other solutions online, such as: removing the motherboard battery and disconnecting power for fifteen minutes; upgrading to the latest version of the BOIS driver, but all attempts were unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking there were still tasks to complete, I switched to a limited network by pulling a web across from the living room into the room. However, this is when the problem returned – wired networking was also unable to be recognized. I then resorted to the ultimate solution of reinstalling the system, which resulted in partition loss during the boot process. If the issue had consistently occurred, I wouldn’t have spent so long troubleshooting it; the ASUS disk conflict is intermittent and triggered by unstable system restarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I purchased a new 2TB solid-state drive from长江存储 (Jiangang Chengsu – Yangtze Storage) with an M.2 interface, and the machine never rebooted until yesterday when I shut it down once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reinstalling-the-system&#34;&gt;Reinstalling the System
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost two years since I last reinstalled the system, and my C drive is completely full. Windows keeps throwing old issues, and various software likes to store things on C: Drive. So, I decided to reinstall the system. After reinstalling the system, the network card issue was resolved, and I restored my daily development environment the next day. While preparing to create a system backup, a new problem arose: after restarting the system, the boot partition disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the steps in the previous article, I rebuilt the boot partition; however, it wasn’t stable, and the partition would frequently fail to load upon restart. I started to wonder if the chassis was being tampered with when I realized that the hard drive cable was loose, but after several checks, there were no issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;memory-retrieval&#34;&gt;Memory Retrieval
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, this machine had once been equipped with a solid-state drive; it was like buying a new PCIE converter (plugged into the graphics card slot) instead of directly installing the hard drive onto the motherboard. This time, it’s installed directly on the motherboard, which may be due to an issue with the motherboard.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;motherboard-manual&#34;&gt;Motherboard Manual
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motherboard manual has issues, with the labeled SATA port positions differing from the actual positions. Due to a large number of disks, all ports are populated with hard drives, with older SSDs utilizing SATA ports. According to the manual, there is a conflict between the ports. However, after testing, this conflict was found to be unstable and would trigger, causing the corresponding disk to fail to load – specifically, as it’s the system disk, the bootloader is also located on that disk, resulting in boot loader failure during system startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions&#34;&gt;Solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinstall the solid state drive onto a PCIe adapter, at this point, the SATA ports on the motherboard will no longer conflict and the system starts normally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Windows Built-in Disk Cleanup Tool: Storage</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-disk-cleanup-storage/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 19:29:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-disk-cleanup-storage/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure from what version it started, but in &lt;code&gt;Windows 11&lt;/code&gt;, the Disk Cleanup tool has been significantly improved and become much smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is that it&amp;rsquo;s an official tool, so it won’t accidentally delete files, won’t have ads, won’t have pop-ups, won’t have background processes, or any unnecessary elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access the Disk Cleanup tool in &lt;code&gt;Windows 11&lt;/code&gt; by going to &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Storage &amp;gt; Temporary Files&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/windows-disk-cleanup-storage/20250106194453.png&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;322px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ordinary users, simply selecting “Clean up” is sufficient; the system will provide suggestions based on your usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I have many temporary files on my disk, so I choose “Temporary Files,” which contains items like &lt;code&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/code&gt; temporary files and &lt;code&gt;Windows Update&lt;/code&gt; temporary files, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Docker Domestic Mirror Proxy Failed</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/docker-domestic-image-proxy-failure/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 18:29:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/docker-domestic-image-proxy-failure/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Deploying Docker on domestic servers, after deployment, if the company doesn’t provide a registry center, the first thing developers need to do is configure a domestic registry mirror address. It&amp;rsquo;s lucky that today there was a server configured with a registry mirror address, but when pulling images, it kept failing to pull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error response from daemon: “https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/”: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- 20250106 – Two days after, all servers were restored, and this didn’t even make the news! All domestic registry mirrors went down --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting-and-repair-attempts&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting and Repair Attempts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, we attempted to switch to alternative mirror acceleration addresses, hoping to resolve the issue. However, as expected, the problem persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, we began modifying the local DNS configuration in an attempt to find a breakthrough at the network resolution level. Unfortunately, after debugging, the fault remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the stability of the local network was heavily questioned, so we decisively switched to a mobile hotspot, attempting to bypass potential local network faults. However, the result was discouraging – there were no signs of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-propagation&#34;&gt;Problem Propagation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We currently have &lt;strong&gt;a few servers deployed domestically&lt;/strong&gt; with Docker environments, and all of them failed to successfully pull the image. We initially hoped to find an alternative solution, but we found that they all consistently failed with identical error messages, indicating that the issue isn&amp;rsquo;t isolated to a single device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further investigation revealed that the image proxy seemingly malfunctioned instantaneously. In this critical moment, we quickly switched to a machine outside of the country, and thankfully, image pulls were restored at this location. This suggests that the problem is likely related to the domestic network links or associated configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strategy-adjustment-circumventing-the-issue&#34;&gt;Strategy Adjustment: Circumventing the Issue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that direct image pulling methods within China have been heavily restricted, while foreign mirrors remain accessible, to expedite project progress, we’ve decided to employ a circumvention tactic. Initially, we switched to foreign servers to successfully pull the required images, subsequently pushing them to domestic mirror repositories to establish a “data bridge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we synchronized modifications to the Dockerfile files, replacing image addresses with those adapted for the Chinese environment and then rebuilt the images, ultimately achieving successful deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The End of the Age of Wild Capitalism: The Era of League of Legends Esports Concludes</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-league-of-legends-era/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:19:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-league-of-legends-era/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The esports industry has experienced rapid development over the past decade and a half, becoming an increasingly significant cultural phenomenon worldwide. Particularly MOBA games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; (LoL), which is often abbreviated as LOL, not only provide players with the joy of competition but also inject powerful momentum into capital, driving the flourishing development of various esports platforms and events. However, all of this has entered a phase of gradual decline with the influx of capital and the rise of the entertainment industry. The rise and fall of PandyTV, the competition between DouYu and Huya, marks the end of the “wild capitalism era,” and the favorable conditions – time, place, people, and heaven – for esports seem to be starting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-injection&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Injection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1 The Early Days of Electronic Sports: From Grassroots to Professionalization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early esports industry started relatively grassroots, especially in China. Many players participated in competitive games like &lt;em&gt;StarCraft&lt;/em&gt; and Dota, driven by their passion for the games. However, the true rise of esports began with the release and promotion of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Following the official entry of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; into the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche community to part of mainstream culture. Notably starting in 2013, the LPL (China Professional League) was established, and &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; became the cornerstone of China’s esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.2 Capital Frenzy Influx: The Rise of PandaTV and Esports Live Streaming Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 marked a watershed moment for the Chinese esports industry. The influx of capital transformed esports from a purely competitive event into a much larger ecosystem. PandaTV, one of the representatives, became a product of excessive capital. Invested by one of its founders, Wang Sicong, PandaTV quickly rose to prominence with its innovative content and massive investment, attracting a large number of viewers and users. However, this was also a typical example of capital “barbaric” inflow – the relentless pursuit of markets often lacks patience and long-term vision. Although PandaTV’s short-term investments achieved certain results due to management issues and excessive reliance on high fever caused by capital, it ultimately declared bankruptcy in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.3 Live Streaming Platform Competition: The “Capital War” Between DouYu and Huya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demise of PandaTV did not lead to the decline of the esports live streaming industry; instead, it propelled the rise of platforms like Douyu and Huya. Douyu and Huya became leading players in the esports industry, and their competition intensified. Early on, Douyu established itself as a benchmark for esports live streaming through the broadcasting of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; professional competitions and the signing of top streamers. Huya, meanwhile, gradually narrowed the gap with Douyu by increasing its investment in esports events and diversifying its platform layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, capital played a huge role again. In 2018, Douyu successfully went public, and Huya also completed its IPO the same year. The rapid flow of capital led to industry consolidation and intensified competition between platforms in terms of streamers and copyrights, forming a “capital war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-fusion-of-mass-entertainment-and-esports&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Fusion of Mass Entertainment and Esports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1 The Trend Towards Mass Entertainment: Capital Flows into Diversified Entertainment Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As capital has heavily invested in the esports industry, esports platform content is gradually becoming mass-entertained. Esports anchors are no longer limited to match commentary and event live streaming; they have begun to expand into singing, dancing, interactive live streams, and other entertainment forms. The content on platforms is becoming more diverse, gradually forming an ecosystem centered around esports but also incorporating various entertainment elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this mass entertainment trend has also brought problems – the original focus of esports culture has been marginalized, replaced by a trend of entertainment above all else. This trend has caused some fans who originally loved esports culture to feel alienated, and capital has begun to pay more attention to other entertainment fields. The excessive influx of capital and profit-seeking behavior have gradually blurred the essence of the esports industry, and the original value concept centered around competition has been weakened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2 The Rise of Mass Entertainment Industry: Capital Withdrawal and Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and the entertainment industry have risen, capital has gradually shifted funds from esports to a wider range of entertainment content. In this process, giants such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance no longer rely solely on esports projects as sources of revenue, but are increasing their investments in areas such as film, music, and short videos.  In particular, the rise of ByteDance, through the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin (TikTok), has overshadowed the limelight of esports with other entertainment content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-league-of-legends-yellow-not-following-yellow-the-decline-of-the-eras-advantage&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: League of Legends’ “Yellow Not Following Yellow”: The Decline of the Era’s Advantage
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has almost become synonymous with China&amp;rsquo;s esports industry, achieving countless professional players, teams, and events, and also spawning a massive esports ecosystem. However, after more than ten years, as a leading project in Chinese esports, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; has entered a phase of “Yellow Not Following Yellow” – a period of decline. Particularly in recent years, the influence of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; is gradually waning, even exhibiting obvious signs of recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1 The “Fracture” in Player Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most noticeable change is the fragmentation of player groups. Initially, esports’ rapid development relied on the support of a large number of young players, many of whom became professional players or spectators thanks to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. That generation of &amp;ldquo;internet addiction&amp;rdquo; teenagers almost grew up under the “era’s advantage,” immersed in the competitive charm of LOL and thus driving the rapid expansion of the entire industry. However, as time went on, these players gradually matured, entered society, and began to shift towards other life and career paths. At the same time, a new generation of young players are not as enthusiastic about &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; as in its heyday, and the esports audience has exhibited a clear age bias and decline in interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2 The “Weakness” in Game Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, after multiple updates and revisions, still maintains a certain competitive charm, but the game’s own innovation in content appears somewhat lacking. Each year&amp;rsquo;s version updates, hero balance adjustments, and new gameplay introductions seem unable to fundamentally address players’ demand for freshness. Meanwhile, the MOBA market has become saturated, and other types of games (such as &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Game For Peace&lt;/em&gt;) have rapidly risen, diverting a large number of players who originally belonged to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. This competitive situation has left &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; unable to escape the role of “follower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-where-does-the-esports-industry-go-from-here&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Where Does the Esports Industry Go From Here?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The esports industry is like a skyscraper that sprung up seemingly overnight, with excessive capital roaming the internet sector, searching for the next big trend – and esports has become one of their targets. Leveraging China’s demographic dividend, the industry achieved tremendous success in a short period, but this success wasn&amp;rsquo;t built on a solid foundation. Excessive capital influx, talent shortages, and weak game content are all hindering the healthy development of the esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to university, I didn’t play many games; Alliance essentially accompanied my growth alongside generations. I watched countless World Finals, and as an outsider, comparing ourselves to Korean and Chinese players, especially Faker, domestic players always felt hesitant during major tournaments. I also know that athletes face immense psychological pressure, but this hasn&amp;rsquo;t been prioritized by teams. Over a decade of development, these mental health issues should be taken seriously, yet they weren’t. Domestic gameplay still relies on the innate talent of the players themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hong Kong Exchange, History of Virtual Currency Development</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-exchange-virtual-currency-history/</link>

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin once again elected as US President, also bringing virtual currencies back into the public eye. The Hong Kong Exchange has been actively deploying related business, and here’s a brief record of its virtual currency development history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the details of relevant contract listings, we found that the initial introduction wasn&amp;rsquo;t spot contracts but futures – which was reasonable due to their better liquidity and easier attraction of institutional investors. Subsequently introducing spot ETFs was also sensible, as they are a more readily accepted investment tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;virtual-currency-list&#34;&gt;Virtual Currency List
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchange’s market data does not provide identifiers to distinguish between contracts that are virtual currencies. However, they can be determined by the contract name. The official trading list provides corresponding subcategories &lt;code&gt;virtualasset&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.hkex.com.hk/Market-Data/Securities-Prices/Exchange-Traded-Products?sc_lang=en&amp;amp;asset=virtualasset&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;december-16-2022&#34;&gt;December 16, 2022
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;hong-kong-exchange-welcomes-first-batch-of-crypto-asset-etfs-in-asia&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Exchange Welcomes First Batch of Crypto Asset ETFs in Asia
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) today (Friday) welcomed the listing of the first batch of crypto asset ETFs in Asia, further expanding its product ecosystem and providing more choices for investors in Hong Kong and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two new ETFs listed today – Southern East One Bitcoin Futures ETF (stock code: 3066) and Southern East One Ethereum Futures ETF (stock code: 3068) – are managed by Southern East One Asset Management Co., Ltd. and track standardized, cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts and ether futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two crypto asset ETFs listed today add another layer of richness to Hong Kong’s increasingly diverse exchange trading product ecosystem,” said Mr. Yao Jia Ren, Chief Operating Officer and Head of Market Development at HKEX. “These new products will provide investors in Asia for the first time with an opportunity to participate in digital asset investment, reflecting our focus on the digital economy and market demand. We look forward to bringing more thematic ETFs and digital asset products in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETF is one of the fastest-growing businesses under HKEX, with its product range continuously expanding and becoming increasingly diversified, including the launch of Hong Kong’s first Metaverse ETF, first Carbon Futures ETF, and first Blockchain ETF within the year. It also marked the first time ETFs were included in the滬深港通 (HKSG Connect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the average daily trading volume of HKEX&amp;rsquo;s buy-and-sell products (ETPs – including ETFs and leveraged and inverse products) for the first eleven months of this year reached HK$118 billion, a 50% increase from last year’s same period of HK$78 billion, reflecting the growing popularity of ETPs among investors. As of November 2022, there were 168 ETPs listed on HKEX with a market capitalization of HK$3,735 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;hong-kong-exchange-welcomes-first-batch-of-spot-virtual-asset-etfs&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Exchange Welcomes First Batch of Spot Virtual Asset ETFs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) today (Tuesday) welcomed the listing of Asia’s first batch of spot virtual asset ETFs, adding to the variety of products in the Hong Kong market and providing investors with more choices, further solidifying Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s position as a leading ETF market in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today’s newly listed spot virtual asset ETFs will enrich the diversified and dynamic ETF market ecosystem of the Hong Kong Exchange, offering investors new investment opportunities in asset classes,” said Robert Lin, Head of Securities Product Development at HKEX. “Following the successful launch of the first virtual asset futures ETF a year ago, these first Asian spot virtual asset ETFs will further enhance the product variety and liquidity for the Hong Kong Exchange’s buy-and-sell products. We look forward to continuing to work closely with market stakeholders to introduce more new products into our internationalized market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first batch of virtual asset futures ETFs, which were listed in 2022, have been favored by investors and traded actively. The average daily trading volume of the three spot virtual asset ETFs listed on HKEX increased from HK$890 million in 2023 to HK$5.13 billion in the first quarter of 2024, while attracting HK$5.29 billion in inflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchange-traded products (ETPs), including ETFs, leveraged and inverse products, are one of the fastest-growing markets for HKEX, with the product variety continuously increasing over the past year. The 16 new ETPs launched in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 include the first Saudi Arabian ETF in the Asia Pacific region, Hong Kong’s first callable option ETFs, and currently there are 179 ETPs listed on HKEX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;hong-kong-exchange-to-launch-virtual-asset-index-series&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Exchange to Launch Virtual Asset Index Series
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) announced today (Monday) that it will launch the Hong Kong Exchange Virtual Asset Indices Series (the “Series”) on November 15, 2024, providing a reliable benchmark price for the rapidly growing asset class of virtual assets, supporting Hong Kong’s development as a leading digital asset hub in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index series will provide transparent and reliable benchmarks for pricing Bitcoin and Ethereum within the Asian time zone, aiming to offer a unified reference price for virtual assets, addressing price discrepancies between this asset class across global exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HKEX Group Chief Executive Officer Chen Yiting stated: “We are pleased to launch the Hong Kong Exchange Virtual Asset Indices Series to meet the demand for this rapidly growing asset class regionally. By providing transparent and reliable real-time benchmarks, we hope to help investors make informed investment decisions, supporting the healthy development of the virtual assets ecosystem and solidifying Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of the index series is part of HKEX&amp;rsquo;s commitment to exploring emerging areas, supporting the development of Hong Kong fintech while also providing investors with important benchmarks and solutions in a constantly evolving market environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index series will include reference indices for Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as reference exchange rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference indices are based on the weighted average spot price of Bitcoin or Ethereum over 24 hours’ trading volume, calculated using aggregated market prices from major virtual asset exchanges, and denominated in US dollars in real-time. The reference exchange rate is designed for financial product settlement and is calculated daily at 4:00 PM Hong Kong time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index series will be the first virtual asset index series developed in Hong Kong that complies with European Union Benchmark Regulation (EUBMR) standards, managed and calculated jointly by a benchmark management company registered in the UK and a virtual assets data and index provider, CCData.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region issued a policy statement on the development of virtual assets, hoping to cultivate a vibrant virtual asset industry and ecosystem in Hong Kong. The launch of the Hong Kong Exchange Virtual Asset Indices Series will help the public increase their understanding of virtual asset investment trends through providing real-time data and daily reference prices within the Asian time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details regarding the design and calculation methods of the index series will be announced as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>“Fee reduction, fee reduction! Domestic mega-ETFs are experiencing a large-scale fee reduction.”</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/etf-fees-cut-china/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 03:08:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/etf-fees-cut-china/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hua Tai Bei Rui HongShan 300 ETF and related funds issued a notice lowering the overall fee rate to the lowest among peers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 19th, Hua Tai Bei Rui Fund announced that, in order to better meet the investment and financial needs of investors, starting from November 22nd, Hua Tai Bei Rui HongShan 300 ETF and its related funds will lower their management fees and custodial fees, and revise relevant fund contract contents.
&lt;strong&gt;After the adjustment, the annual management fee for Hua Tai Bei Rui HongShan 300 ETF and its related funds is reduced to 0.15%, and the annual custodial fee is reduced to 0.05%, all set to the lowest rate among index funds.&lt;/strong&gt;
Almost simultaneously, other leading industry ETFs such as Huaxia HongShan 300 ETF, Huaxia ShangZheng 50 ETF, Nanfang ZhongCheng 500 ETF, JiaShi HongShan 300 ETF, and YiFangDa Entrepreneurial Board ETF also issued notices lowering management and custodial fees, with all rates reduced to 0.15% and 0.05%.
Unlike previous ETF rate reductions, this reduction was initiated by market-leading products with significant scale advantages, which will have a substantial impact on the industry’s subsequent developments. Exchange data showed that as of November 18th, Hua Tai Bei Rui HongShan 300 ETF had a scale exceeding 370 billion yuan, making it currently the largest ETF in terms of size.
The largest batch of super ETFs leading the way in reducing fees demonstrated their proactive willingness to benefit investors and allowed investors to invest in popular and liquid products at higher value for money.
Industry analysts believe that ETFs with significant scale advantages lowering fees will, on one hand, facilitate the public fund’s role in providing inclusive financial services, helping investors reduce holding costs and enhance returns and investment satisfaction across a wider area;
On the other hand, low rates will also further improve the competitiveness of the products themselves. With the added benefits of liquidity diversion effects and cost operation advantages, the products are expected to attract more medium-to-long term incremental funds into the market, helping build a good ecosystem for “long money long investment.”
In recent years, thanks to its flexible trading, high transparency, strong liquidity, low investment barriers, and other unique advantages, broad-based ETFs have become the main channel for capital entering at low levels and “long money long investment.”
This reduction in fees may serve as an &amp;ldquo;accelerator,&amp;rdquo; making it easier for long-term funds to enter the A-share market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Tianhong Fund that I invested in hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet released an announcement, it should be followed up on. If no update is provided, I will consider switching funds.
Original Management Fee: 0.5%, Custody Fee: 0.1%. New Management Fee: 0.15%, Custody Fee: 0.05%. This reduction is quite significant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>“Increased scrutiny of third-party advisor regulation, and the beneficiaries behind the ‘Douyin (TikTok) stock trading’ phenomenon face a crackdown?”</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/third-party-wealth-managers-scrutiny-tiktok-stock-winners-crackdown/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:59:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/third-party-wealth-managers-scrutiny-tiktok-stock-winners-crackdown/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hammer is falling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the surge of short videos, investment advisory services are reportedly entering a fast lane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In late September, after a period of intense activity in the A-share market, Douyin (TikTok) recommendations for stocks garnered attention from various parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerous financial commentators have risen to prominence on Douyin, indirectly causing some volatility in capital markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behind these rapidly rising financial commentators lies a significant force: third-party investment advisory service companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s understood that many third-party advisory firms operate multiple accounts on short video platforms, using content distribution (投流) to attract users to watch investment teaching videos and boost enthusiasm for purchasing corresponding products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are even rumors that one third-party advisory firm achieved revenue of 10 billion yuan in October alone, exceeding its first-half earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, “good times” are facing more uncertainties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since November, multiple departments have issued notices requiring securities service institutions to strengthen the compliance management of self-media accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On November 15th, Futu Securities (300033.SZ) announced that a subsidiary was penalized by the China Securities Regulatory Commission for engaging in suggestive stock recommendations through livestreaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This may be signaling a stricter regulatory environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The expansion of third-party investment advisory service firms like Fangyuan Intelligence Investment (9636.HK) is likely to face greater pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;close-monitoring-by-regulators&#34;&gt;Close Monitoring by Regulators
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of short video platforms like Douyin (TikTok) has amplified emotional voices and indirectly impacted trading behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Giant Network, from September 27th to October 8th, when transaction volumes hit record highs, the Douyin A-share keyword search index soared from 4.2384 million to 12.7786 million, expanding by more than twice that amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under these circumstances, the “stirring up” behavior of third-party investment advisory firms is attracting the attention of regulatory authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment advisors recommending stocks through live broadcasts constitutes a high-frequency violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 8th, the Guangdong Securities Regulatory Bureau took measures to suspend new clients for a company’s livestreaming that presented “implicit stock recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 14th evening, the Guangdong Securities and Futures Industry Association issued an announcement titled &amp;ldquo;Live Streaming Control Lacking Effectiveness, Institutions Suspended Business,&amp;rdquo; directly addressing situations where some institutions with securities consulting qualifications had inadequate controls during live streaming operations and engaged in recommending stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guangdong Securities and Futures Industry Association stated: “Strictly prohibit livestreaming stock recommendations. Livestreaming is a public media dissemination platform, and livestreaming personnel, regardless of whether they are registered as securities investment advisors, shall not recommend stocks during live broadcasts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an isolated case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, the Shanghai Securities Regulatory Bureau disclosed a penalty notice involving illegal stock recommendations on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following regulatory investigation, Wang Yong, a consultant at Haishun Securities Investment Consulting Co., Ltd.’s Shanghai branch, violated professional norms by publishing misleading videos through WeChat Video No., which contradicted industry standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Securities Regulatory Bureau subsequently issued a supervisory management measure to issue a warning letter to Wang Yong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Wind (ID:TradeWind01) information, some unqualified investment advisory firms have been using “rented” brokerage accounts to promote stocks on Douyin and have since been suspended from broadcasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some people are livestreaming in the industry, but they are actually renting under a brokerage firm, which gives them investment advisor qualifications, then they use live streaming to generate leads, and sell investment advisory product bundles offline,” said a consultant from South China to Wind (ID:TradeWind01). “However, because they recommended stocks during the livestreaming, they were discovered and subsequently suspended.” Regular brokerages typically discuss sector trends but do not involve individual stock recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, regulators are closely monitoring illegal stock recommendations on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Shenzhen Securities Regulatory Bureau recently notified that some institutions or individuals were using self-media to illegally recommend stocks, in order to further regulate the self-media operations of securities investment consulting agencies in the辖区, all institutions should further strengthen company self-media operation management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may pose more challenges for the business development of various third-party investment advisory service firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-flow-business-is-false&#34;&gt;“The Flow Business” is False
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether retail investors who were attracted by short videos made a profit remains unknown, but the valuation of third-party investment advisory service companies as &amp;ldquo;water sellers&amp;rdquo; in the secondary market has soared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As “China’s first online teaching stock,” JiuFang Intelligence’s market capitalization rose from 2.878 billion yuan at the beginning of September to 12.464 billion yuan on November 13, with an increase of 333.08% over 49 trading days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The semi-annual report showed that in the first half of the year, JiuFang Intelligence conducted brand exposure on social media platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu, and by the end of June, it had 488 accounts and 46 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, as JiuFang Intelligence’s Chief Investment Advisor, “Hongbangzhuxi” has 2.26 million fans on Douyin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have deeply cultivated MCN operations, focusing on users, and synergistically promote the comprehensive development of traffic, brands, and products,” JiuFang Intelligence stated. “By deeply integrating live streaming, short videos, and other new media tools, leveraging AI technology to build a fan network, and actively exploring e-commerce models, we effectively achieve the efficient conversion of traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JiuFang Intelligence’s investment advisory course packages cover price ranges from tens of yuan to more than ten万元. The most expensive package, “Super Investor,” is priced at 139,600 yuan per six months, including exclusive insights and private advisor services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, JiuFang Intelligence’s investment advisory product refund rate is above 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2024, the refund rates for JiuFang Intelligence’s flagship series and JiuFang Intelligence’s Qionglong Series reached 14.7% and 18.5%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, under regulatory scrutiny, whether JiuFang Intelligence&amp;rsquo;s business development will be affected remains to be further observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, media reports said that accounts belonging to third-party investment advisory companies such as JiuFang Intelligence have been impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, a media report stated that “Hongbangzhuxi” was suspended from live streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on November 15th, XinFeng (ID:TradeWind01) searched the account and found that the appointment for “Hongbangzhuxi’s” livestream on November 18th was still available in the livestream interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, market sources said that relevant departments have entered JiuFang Intelligence for inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a close source to JiuFang Intelligence told XinFeng (ID:TradeWind01) that the inspection belonged to routine inspections and had already ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only company involved in this round of regulatory storm rumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reports that Tianhong Securities was investigated for illegal stock recommendations and may suspend business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Tianhong Securities stated on November 15th, “There were no illegal stock recommendation cases, and there was no investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that same evening, Tianhong Securities announced that its subsidiary Zhejiang Tianhong Cloud Software Co., Ltd. was penalized with a three-month new customer suspension due to inadequate compliance controls in the promotion of livestreaming business and the existence of scenarios suggesting recommendations of stocks, by the Zhejiang Securities Regulatory Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may also mean that regulatory departments are further focusing on荐股 (recommendation of stocks) content on social media platforms such as Douyin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the cake of short videos has also attracted many securities firms, but due to compliance requirements, securities firms are currently cautious about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A securities industry insider told XinFeng (ID:TradeWind01) that the company is exploring methods for short video operations and lead generation, and it has organized personnel to visit short video platform companies for learning, but due to compliance requirements, it is still in an exploratory stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, behind the various regulatory compliance requirements is because the content on short video platforms has a distinct emotional color, but investment requires market participants to maintain rationality, and the two exist in a natural conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If uncontrolled emotions influence the capital market, it can easily trigger violent fluctuations in the market, which goes against the long-term healthy development of the capital market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What manner should securities holding institutions embrace the arrival of the short video era to avoid “stepping on red lines”? This is clearly a difficult question for all parties.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CentOS Stream&lt;/code&gt; is the upstream open-source development platform prior to Red Hat’s &lt;code&gt;Linux&lt;/code&gt; distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first noticed the open-source operating system lifecycle &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/redhat-centos-lifecycle/&#34; &gt;redhat and centos life cycle&lt;/a&gt; had ended, and I was wondering what was going on. Besides security issues, dnf wasn’t working, and I recently encountered failures when installing tools – checking the repository sources revealed that &lt;code&gt;CentOS 8 Stream&lt;/code&gt; had reached its end of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;centos-stream-introduction&#34;&gt;CentOS Stream Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;positioning-and-roles&#34;&gt;Positioning and Roles
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream sits between Fedora Linux (upstream development) and RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux, downstream development), acting as a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be considered a version for experiencing the latest Red Hat-based Linux features, suitable for those who want to try out new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins-and-background&#34;&gt;Origins and Background
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, Red Hat began to seek more effective ways to develop its enterprise-grade Linux platform, leading to the launch of CentOS Stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentOS 8 ended maintenance at the end of 2021, and CentOS Stream continued to be updated as its successor, becoming the future direction of the CentOS project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-and-advantages&#34;&gt;Features and Advantages
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream is a rolling release Linux distribution that provides faster updates. It offers greater transparency and more opportunities for community, partner, and customer participation, allowing users to contribute to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) more quickly and directly.
The content of CentOS Stream is software that Red Hat intends to include in the next stable version of RHEL, therefore it provides a stable ABI/API for developers and testers within the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-cases-and-target-users&#34;&gt;Use Cases and Target Users
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream is suitable for those CentOS users who want to continue receiving the latest Linux feature updates, as well as developers and partners who wish to participate in Red Hat Enterprise Linux development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also aims to help community members, Red Hat partners, and others take full advantage of innovative open-source software in a more stable and predictable Linux ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Browsing through the historical commit records, the site has undergone numerous theme switches. Each theme switch involved some custom modifications, and this is where I’m documenting the approach to customizing themes. My &lt;code&gt;Github&lt;/code&gt; repository briefly maintained the even theme, but due to my obsessive-compulsive tendencies, I resisted upgrading the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; compiler to the latest version, which resulted in incompatibility with the even theme, so I switched back to the &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugos-modularity&#34;&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Modularity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we talk about modularity, many people think of Nginx modules and IDEA plugins, among others. Typically, I can upload some modules to satisfy my differentiated needs. The reason everyone likes this kind of module is that it’s sufficiently flexible – you don’t have to put in too much effort to meet your own requirements. Because often, even though the overall situation is similar, there are always some details that differ. This also illustrates the complexity of software, not just technically but also from a business perspective. Most of the time, we face business complexity. This is precisely where the saying “it’s like crossing a mountain range” best applies. Today, not only the internet industry and finance, but even traditional manufacturing industries are using information systems to help businesses with their production and management. Even a leave system can have differences between companies in the same industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the modules you might be familiar with, Hugo&amp;rsquo;s modules are different – they don’t focus on meeting differentiated needs based on functionality. Instead, they rely primarily on directory structure to identify identical structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@sunwei.xyz/07-hugo%E6%9E%B6%E6%9E%84-hugo%E7%9A%84%E6%A8%A1%E5%9D%97-8ef5a520a822&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;07. Hugo Architecture — Hugo Modules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34;&gt;[[imports]]
path = &amp;quot;github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/v3&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;git submodule&lt;/code&gt; approach can still be used, and this article doesn’t recommend it. If you introduce a theme, maintaining it will be more complicated – you&amp;rsquo;ll need to manage the theme as a separate Git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theme-modification-logichttpsstackjimmycaicomguidemodify-theme&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stack.jimmycai.com/guide/modify-theme&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Theme Modification Logic&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have a solid understanding of the foundational concepts of modularization, customizing themes becomes much simpler. Hugo themes are currently assembled from multiple different modules. To modify one module, simply locate its corresponding template file and make the changes directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As extracted from the official &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this method, there will be no files under the &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; directory.  To modify a theme, you must copy the file you want to modify into the same directory under the &lt;code&gt;layouts&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, to modify the &lt;code&gt;themes/hugo-theme-stack/layouts/partials/head/custom.html&lt;/code&gt; file, you must copy it to &lt;code&gt;layouts/partials/head/custom.html&lt;/code&gt; and modify it there (copying the code from the theme&amp;rsquo;s repository). The same applies to the &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-template-files&#34;&gt;How to Find Template Files
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;conventional-approach&#34;&gt;Conventional Approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review the source files of the topic, understand its design rationale, identify the corresponding template file, and modify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;brute-force-approach&#34;&gt;Brute Force Approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I’m not very familiar with frontend code, I sometimes resort to a brute force approach, such as opening the corresponding page directly in the browser, finding the areas I want to modify, and using “Inspect Element” to pinpoint the &lt;code&gt;css name&lt;/code&gt;, then searching the source code for the relevant file, copying it into the site directory, and making changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips&#34;&gt;Tips
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official setup provides a default file for customizing styles. To modify specific areas, we can split them into multiple files and import them using &lt;code&gt;custom.scss&lt;/code&gt;. This approach allows for better management of style files.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consolidated-modifications-6h&#34;&gt;Consolidated Modifications (6h)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s now the first year of &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; coding, and detailed content will not be pasted here for brevity; instead, we&amp;rsquo;ll simply list some of the modifications made to this site, such as adjusting the copy button styles, reconfiguring the code block styles, and &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt; was easily handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall: Global text style, retaining the display style previously used by merging &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;info cn&lt;/code&gt;, which is friendly for Chinese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homepage: Added mouse interaction animation to the right navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homepage: New article summaries added (took quite a while to implement using a clever workaround)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll Bar: Improved the styling of the scroll bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Blocks: Introduced the &lt;code&gt;highlight.js&lt;/code&gt; code highlighting plugin, beautifying the code block styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Article Details: Some content is from reprints, with new author information display and original link display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive Pages: Removed the color mask from the category images at the top to display the original image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive Pages: Added a statistical display panel for categorization by year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive Pages: Two-column layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; theme has a high component reuse rate, which also led to the lengthy time taken to add new article summaries to the homepage.  After modifying the corresponding components, changes occurred in the article details page as well, resulting in redundant display of content. The &lt;code&gt;golang template&lt;/code&gt; syntax wasn&amp;rsquo;t very familiar, so it took up quite a bit of time.  Component parameter passing was never resolved, and ultimately, through a clever workaround, a &lt;code&gt;JavaScript&lt;/code&gt; script was independently introduced to the homepage to implement the summary preview by using custom special variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, high component reuse can also be a problem, leading to unintended consequences when modifying one place affecting others. Therefore, when modifying themes, you must pay attention not to disrupt existing logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;comments&#34;&gt;Comments
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guy&amp;rsquo;s modifications are more refined: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.reincarnatey.net/2024/0719-better-waline/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://blog.reincarnatey.net/2024/0719-better-waline/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;del&gt;This site simply enabled the &lt;code&gt;Waline&lt;/code&gt; comment system, as the &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; theme defaults to supporting &lt;code&gt;Waline&lt;/code&gt;. Just configure it in the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommend contacting via email on the homepage, this site does not open the comments section&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Town Brahmin: The “Big Man” of Small Places</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:02:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, the popular &amp;ldquo;Da Bing&amp;rdquo; (Big Ice) on Douyin (TikTok) has been frequently seen with short video accounts extracted from her live streams. A listener who joined a live call asked: “Da Bing, I want to sell my house in Xi’an and return home to settle down.” Da Bing responded: “At your age, you&amp;rsquo;re in your early thirties; you can&amp;rsquo;t settle down. Your parents are on the path of aging, your children haven’t started a family or established themselves, and if you return home, you’ll still need to deal with the &lt;em&gt;poren&lt;/em&gt;.”
Let’s set aside whether the viewpoint is right or wrong, what does the term “poren” mean?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;township-brahmins-the-big-shots-of-small-places&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Township Brahmins: The “Big Shots” of Small Places&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many small county towns, people often talk about so-called &amp;ldquo;township brahmins&amp;rdquo;—the existence of these individuals seems to be a symbol of local society. They are not necessarily genuine religious figures and do not possess “high-level” titles; rather, they are seemingly ordinary but nonetheless influential people. They represent “power, status, and influence” within that county town, symbolizing a particular class or stratum in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-xiancheng-babao&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an “Xiancheng Babao?”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand that “Babao” originally referred to the highest caste in Indian society, representing wisdom, authority, and spiritual supremacy. In China’s county towns, the term “Xiancheng Babao” doesn&amp;rsquo;t have such a complex religious background; it’s more of a metaphor for a social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, an “Xiancheng Babao” can be understood as some “cultural authorities” within the county town – such as teachers, doctors, well-known merchants, and officials. Although their positions may seem ordinary, in this relatively closed environment, they possessed a comparatively higher social status, or their opinions and actions had influence that could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-the-county-town-brahmin&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is the “County Town Brahmin”?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In county towns, you’ll find figures like this – the “Brahmin” – in almost every industry. They might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educators:&lt;/strong&gt; Particularly teachers who have spent decades working in the area, not necessarily graduates of prestigious universities, but who understand how to build credibility through knowledge and are widely respected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Government Officials:&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy county magistrates, section chiefs, etc., who control certain resources and power – even if their positions aren’t high-ranking, their limited scope of authority can make them local “Brahmins.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local “Entrepreneurs”:&lt;/strong&gt; Some business owners in county towns, though not large in scale, hold a certain amount of wealth and have a voice in the area. They might run one or two well-known small local businesses, wielding considerable influence within the county town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people, while not as prominent as figures in larger cities or high-ranking officials, hold a status almost equivalent to “cultural elders” or “centers of power” within this small community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-status-of-county-town-brahmins--how-does-it-impact-society&#34;&gt;The Status of “County Town Brahmins” – How Does it Impact Society?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the significance of “county town brahmins,” we must consider the unique environment of the county town. Here, information flow is slower than in large cities, and social class mobility is relatively fixed. These “brahmins” often gained prestige, knowledge, and networks through long-term dedication to the local area. They influence various aspects of local politics, economics, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; In small places, especially where education systems are not as developed and people have limited choices, local &amp;ldquo;brahmins&amp;rdquo; subtly shape the cultural atmosphere through knowledge transmission in classrooms, explanations in media, and even moral guidance in social settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concentration of Social Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the limited population and resources of county towns, these “brahmins” are often one of the primary controllers of local resources. Whether it’s social welfare, policy implementation, or approval of certain projects, they invariably have an influence. Their power of speech and decision-making allows them to hold a prominent position in local society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Networked Structure of Relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; In a relatively closed small society, interpersonal relationships are crucial. These “county town brahmins” build strong social networks to control information flow and resource allocation, enabling them to play a decisive role at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-metaphor-of-the-county-sharma&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Metaphor of the “County Sharma”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite often being revered and admired, this position of “high above” is not without its issues. In modern society, it’s easy to see that many “Sharmas” – those in county-level positions – lack genuine ability and innovative spirit; instead, they maintain their status through hereditary relationships and resource monopolies. With the development of informatization, these “Sharmas’” power is gradually being broken, and new social mobility is beginning to influence the appearance of small counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, “County Sharma” is a fascinating social phenomenon that reflects the power and cultural structures within local societies. Although their “power” may not directly threaten national governance, they are undoubtedly key figures within the region. In this era of rapid information flow and accelerating social change, these “Sharmas” in county towns may be facing unprecedented challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this would have happened if we hadn’t started with curiosity about what a ‘purohito’ was, and then tossed it to &lt;code&gt;kimi&lt;/code&gt;. The result was surprisingly funny – I could see the web interface already pulling up search results, but suddenly they were unable to be displayed as related content. Then I wondered, did this word have some special significance? So I threw it at &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt;, and that&amp;rsquo;s how this article came about.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linux backend services handling large volumes of string data – performance is slow.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-backend-slow-string-processing/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:42:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-backend-slow-string-processing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the history of C++ development projects, we utilized a custom protocol for communication, which employed a two-dimensional array pattern. When processing large volumes of data, the protocol required iterating through the arrays and performing serialization operations to generate logs. Due to its low efficiency, this resulted in noticeable lag or stuttering within the system under heavy load, as reported by the business departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-identification&#34;&gt;Problem Identification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When troubleshooting the issue, we first performed a performance analysis of the system and discovered that CPU utilization increased significantly when processing large amounts of data, and system response times became longer. By analyzing the system logs, we identified numerous serialization operations, which were inefficient when handling two-dimensional arrays, leading to a decline in system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool captured thread information for the service, pinpointing that the log threads spent most of their time processing string concatenation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is today’s focus: different accumulation methods have significant efficiency differences. Historically, the code used the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator, which frequently creates temporary objects and is very inefficient. You know it&amp;rsquo;s bad, but you don&amp;rsquo;t know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; bad it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;demo-verification&#34;&gt;Demo Verification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the project code, we extracted the business logic and wrote a simple demo to verify the efficiency issues of string concatenation. We compiled and ran it in &lt;code&gt;Release&lt;/code&gt; mode using the &lt;code&gt;vs2022&lt;/code&gt; compiler under &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;gcc8.5&lt;/code&gt; compiler under &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt;, comparing the efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-point-explanation&#34;&gt;Key Point Explanation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project utilized Method Four, and before obtaining test data, readers were encouraged to consider which method was most efficient and which was least efficient. I was quite surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 1 (&lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; Concatenation)&lt;/strong&gt;: Directly concatenates each field using &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; into a string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 2 (&lt;code&gt;std::ostringstream&lt;/code&gt; Concatenation)&lt;/strong&gt;: Uses a stream (&lt;code&gt;std::ostringstream&lt;/code&gt;) to concatenate fields, which is more efficient, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 3 (Pre-allocated Memory &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; Concatenation)&lt;/strong&gt;: Pre-allocates enough memory for the string using &lt;code&gt;reserve&lt;/code&gt;, reducing the overhead of memory reallocation and improving performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 4 (&lt;code&gt;bodys = bodys + body + &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;: Creates a new temporary string object each time it concatenates, leading to decreased performance, particularly when dealing with large-scale concatenation due to repeated memory allocation and copying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to the results, we can see that the project inadvertently selected the least efficient method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the optimization efficiency of different platforms and compilers. Microsoft’s &lt;code&gt;visual studio&lt;/code&gt; consistently performs excellently in terms of string optimization, while the &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; compiler has somewhat lower optimization efficiency in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running the code on different machines, direct comparison between the two datasets is meaningless; instead, we can compare the differences between the various concatenation methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>C&#43;&#43; Lambda Expression Parameter Lifetimes</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-lambda-parameter-lifetime/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:23:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-lambda-parameter-lifetime/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In C++, lambda expressions are a convenient way to create anonymous functions that can capture external variables and use them within their bodies. This makes lambdas a flexible programming tool. However, the lifetime of parameters in a lambda expression is an aspect that requires careful attention, especially when capturing and passing parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-lambda-expression-parameter-lifetime&#34;&gt;1. Lambda Expression Parameter Lifetime
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lifetime of parameters in a lambda expression is typically the same as that of other C++ functions. Parameters exist while the function is being called, and their lifetime ends when the function call terminates. However, due to the possibility of lambdas capturing external variables, the parameter&amp;rsquo;s lifetime is also affected by how it’s captured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-capturing-the-relationship-with-parameter-lifecycles&#34;&gt;2. Capturing the Relationship with Parameter Lifecycles
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;21-capturing-external-variables&#34;&gt;2.1 Capturing External Variables
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;C++ lambda expressions allow capturing external variables in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture by Value:&lt;/strong&gt; When capturing by value, the value of the external variable is copied into the lambda&amp;rsquo;s internal scope. The lifetime of this copy is controlled by the lambda’s own lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture by Reference:&lt;/strong&gt; When capturing by reference, a reference to the external variable is retained. The lambda’s reference points to the original external variable, and its lifetime depends on the external variable’s lifetime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;int x = 10;
auto lambda_by_value = [x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };  // Captures a copy of x
auto lambda_by_reference = [&amp;amp;x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };  // Captures a reference to x

lambda_by_value();  // Prints 10
lambda_by_reference();  // Prints 10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For captured variables, the lifetimes are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture by Value:&lt;/strong&gt; When capturing, the external variable’s value is copied into the lambda, and the copy is destroyed when the lambda’s lifetime ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture by Reference:&lt;/strong&gt; The lambda holds a reference to the external variable; &lt;strong&gt;the external variable must be valid at the time the lambda is used, or undefined behavior results.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;22-lambda-parameters&#34;&gt;2.2 Lambda Parameters
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lambda parameters are similar to regular function parameters; their lifetime is limited to the lambda function body. That is, lambda parameters are created when the lambda is called and their lifetime ends when the lambda call finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;auto lambda = [](int a, int b) {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; a + b &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
};
lambda(5, 10);  // a and b are the parameters of the lambda here
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are the parameters of the lambda expression, they are created when the lambda is called and destroyed after the lambda executes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-lifecycle-issues-when-capturing-external-variables&#34;&gt;3. Lifecycle Issues When Capturing External Variables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;31-whether-captured-variables-can-be-effective-outside-lambda&#34;&gt;3.1 Whether Captured Variables Can Be Effective Outside Lambda
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value Capture&lt;/strong&gt;: Even if the external variable is destroyed after the lambda call, the lambda internally still holds a copy of the external variable. Therefore, the copy within the lambda can be safely used even if the external variable no longer exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;int x = 10;
auto lambda = [x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };
x = 20;  // x is modified after the lambda call
lambda();  // Prints 10, captures a copy of x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference Capture&lt;/strong&gt;: If the external variable is captured by reference, the lambda&amp;rsquo;s access to this reference depends on the lifetime of the external variable. If the external variable is destroyed before the lambda executes, a dangling reference issue will occur, leading to undefined behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;int x = 10;
auto lambda = [&amp;amp;x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };
x = 20;  // x is modified before the lambda call
lambda();  // Prints 20, captures a reference to x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to ensure that the external variable is valid when the lambda executes if the execution order of the lambda is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Win11 Logitech G431 Headset Driver Installation</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 07:20:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Picking up where we left off, I discovered that GitHub had an update, which was a little exciting. The customer service team said the issue with the driver not loading properly was resolved. However, after going through all of this – reinstalling and uninstalling – it still wasn’t working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing to contact customer service to inquire about a resolution, I was informed that an engineer could provide remote assistance. However, the engineer’s working hours coincided exactly with my own, leaving me with no option but to abandon the effort. Reviewing the documentation from the previous troubleshooting issue, I decided to attempt a manual driver installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obtaining-driver-installation-packages&#34;&gt;Obtaining Driver Installation Packages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logitech does not provide separate driver installation packages for devices. How can I obtain the driver files?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with the system image package left over from the previous system reinstallation, we can reinstall the system once in a local virtual machine, and then deploy a clean copy of Ghub in the pure system, inserting the headset device into the virtual machine to find the driver path and copy it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevant paths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\ProgramData\LGHUB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\logi_audio.inf_amd64_010b035044e24be4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;device-manager&#34;&gt;Device Manager
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus is on how to find the second path – let’s first briefly outline how to manually manage driver files in a Windows 11 system. This content &lt;strong&gt;is identified using the method of controlling variables by repeatedly plugging and unplugging devices, analyzing device information within Device Manager inside a virtual machine, and identifying three drivers that need to be handled for headphones.&lt;/strong&gt; Two of these drivers are system-provided, while one is provided by Logitech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/20240605073331.png&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;47&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;114px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second driver shown in the image, it’s provided by Logitech.  Let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the current driver program for the device and then search all driver paths within the virtual machine. Of course, you first need to find files starting with “logi,” then compare the files, which will help you pinpoint the driver folder. Copying the entire folder gives you the driver installation package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/20240605073933.png&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;146&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;352px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-the-driver&#34;&gt;Installing the Driver
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the device manager interface, click: Update driver, then click: Browse my computer to find drivers, and you’ll arrive at the following interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/20240605074130.png&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;138&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;332px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when you open it, you&amp;rsquo;ll only see one driver – the standard USB driver. Select &amp;ldquo;Install from disk&amp;rdquo; and the path is the folder we copied earlier. After installation, you’ll be able to add Logitech-specific drivers in the dropdown list. Switch the device driver to the newly installed driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/20240605074208.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;human-anatomy-device-driven&#34;&gt;Human Anatomy Device-Driven
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These driver files are provided by the system. You only need to check if there is an exclamation mark preceding the device driver name. If there is, enter the Driver Selection interface, randomly switch to a different type of driver, and then revert it back to restore normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;completed&#34;&gt;Completed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microphone volume on the headphones has been restored to normal, and the familiar in-ear functionality has returned.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the C drive on my desktop computer, which I use for development, had run out of space. I specially took out a 256GB semi-retired solid state hard drive and used it as the C drive. Unfortunately, I kept messing around with it. Since moving to Shanghai, I’ve been busy with various things, and last week I finally took some time to reinstall the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system reinstallation went smoothly, and installing everyday software and deploying development environments didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter any problems. A few days later, I planned to relax and play a few games when I realized that the drivers for my mouse and headphones hadn’t been installed. Both devices are from Logitech, so I downloaded the GHUB software, which can automatically identify hardware and install drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an unexpected problem occurred. The mouse driver installed successfully, but the headphone driver kept displaying “Loading…”. I suspected that the latest version of Windows 11 might be incompatible with Logitech’s drivers, causing the installation to fail. So, I started searching for information and trying to manually install the drivers, but the problem remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s briefly explain what the functions of these two devices’ drivers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mouse driver is mainly used to adjust mouse movement speed and other functions. I rarely use macro functions; I just need to restore previously remembered parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The headphone driver primarily focuses on the headset function, which is very useful during team voice chats, allowing me to hear my own voice. Although there’s a similar listening function in the system&amp;rsquo;s microphone settings, it doesn’t perform as well as the driver implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite repeatedly trying, the headphone driver always failed to load properly. Today, I finally thought of contacting customer support to inquire about the situation and see if there were any solutions. The customer service representative told me that their servers had recently experienced an issue, causing driver downloads to be abnormal. They are currently working on resolving the problem, asking me not to panic, and promising a solution with the next update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the headphone driver issue hasn’t been resolved yet, at least I now know the cause, and I hope the problem can be solved as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cancellation-of-national-level-first-and-second-tier-commercial-personal-housing-loan-interest-rate-policy-lower-bounds&#34;&gt;Cancellation of National-Level First and Second-Tier Commercial Personal Housing Loan Interest Rate Policy Lower Bounds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Headquarters of the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, branches of the People’s Bank of China in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and planned cities; branches of all state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and all joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to implement the decision deployment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, adapt to the new supply and demand relationship in China’s real estate market and the new expectations of people for high-quality housing, and promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, the following matters regarding adjustments to commercial personal housing loan interest rate policies are hereby notified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. The lower bounds of interest rates on commercial personal housing loans for first-tier and second-tier housing nationwide are cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;II. Branches of the People’s Bank of China at provincial levels will, in accordance with the principle of tailoring measures to local conditions, guide provincial market interest rate pricing self-regulatory mechanisms to determine independently whether to set lower bounds on commercial personal housing loan interest rates and their respective levels (if any), based on the real estate market situation within each jurisdiction and local government regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;III. Financial institutions in the banking industry shall reasonably determine the specific interest rate level for each loan, taking into account the interest rate limits determined by provincial market interest rate pricing self-regulatory mechanisms (if any) and factors such as the operating conditions of the institution and its customer risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-personal-housing-mortgage-loan-interest-rates-by-025-percentage-points&#34;&gt;Reducing Personal Housing Mortgage Loan Interest Rates by 0.25 Percentage Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, Shanghai Headquarters, branches of the People’s Bank of China in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and planned special-purpose cities; policy banks, state commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People’s Bank of China has decided to reduce personal housing mortgage loan interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, effective May 18, 2024. The interest rates for first-time and second-home personal housing mortgage loans with a term of less than 5 years (including 5 years) will be adjusted to 2.35% and 2.85%, respectively.  The interest rates for first-time and second-home personal housing mortgage loans with a term of less than 5 years (including 5 years) will also be no lower than 2.775% and 3.325%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;down-payment-ratio-adjusted-to-no-less-than-15&#34;&gt;Down Payment Ratio Adjusted to No Less Than 15%
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, Shanghai Headquarters, branches of the People’s Bank of China in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and planned unitary cities; the Regulatory Bureau of the National Financial Supervision and Administration; all state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and all joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to implement the decision-making deployment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, adapt to the new supply and demand relationship in China’s real estate market and the new expectations of people for high-quality housing, and promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, the following matters regarding personal mortgage loans are hereby notified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For residential households purchasing commercial first-time home purchases, the minimum down payment ratio for commercial personal mortgages on first-time home purchases will be adjusted to no less than 15%, and the minimum down payment ratio for commercial personal mortgages on second-time home purchases will be adjusted to no less than 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, the branches of the People’s Bank of China at each provincial level, and the派出机构 (outposts) of the National Financial Supervision and Administration will, according to the control requirements of local governments, independently determine the minimum down payment ratio limits for first-time and second-time home purchases in various cities based on a principle of tailoring policies to local conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-central-bank-will-establish-a-30-billion-yuan-guarantee-housing-re-loan&#34;&gt;The Central Bank Will Establish a 30 Billion Yuan Guarantee Housing Re-Loan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 4:00 PM, representatives from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the People’s Bank of China, and the National Financial Supervision and Administration Commission gathered at a routine policy briefing by the State Council to introduce measures to effectively ensure contract fulfillment (保交房).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Vice Governor Tao Ling announced that the central bank will establish a 30 billion yuan guarantee housing re-loan facility to support local state-owned enterprises in purchasing completed but unsold commercial properties at reasonable prices for use as self-built or rental-based affordable housing. This is expected to drive an additional 50 billion yuan in bank loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the People’s Bank of China, the guarantee housing re-loan term can be extended up to four times annually, with a rate of 1.75%, aimed at 21 nationwide banks. It incentivizes banks to lend to local state-owned enterprises selected by city governments to purchase completed but unsold commercial properties for use as affordable housing. The purchased properties are strictly limited to those commercially available properties built by real estate developers that have not yet been sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding this policy, the central bank will soon issue the &lt;em&gt;Notice on Measures Concerning the Establishment of the Guarantee Housing Re-Loan Facility&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Balancing Bank Marketing Strategies with the Art of Personal Financial Management</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 01:33:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the renovation project at home has led to a surge in daily expenses. I’ve also been using credit cards, paying them off within the billing cycle, although I have enough cash on hand, I prefer to keep it in money funds to earn some additional interest income. Furthermore, to ensure financial stability, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up automatic payment functionality so that my credit card bills can be paid promptly upon maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-status-deposits-increase-loans-decrease&#34;&gt;Bank Status: Deposits Increase, Loans Decrease
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst increasing economic uncertainty, people are more inclined to save rather than consume or invest. This has led to an increase in bank deposits, but it also means banks have to pay higher interest rates to depositors. Conversely, due to reduced consumer and investment activity, loan demand has decreased, making it difficult for banks to generate interest income through lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attract and retain customers, banks are forced to offer more competitive deposit rates, further compressing the bank’s net interest margin. Simultaneously, in order to stimulate economic growth and consumption, central banks may implement policies of lowering benchmark interest rates, which will also impact bank loan rates and consequently affect their profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;banking-marketing-strategies-cultivating-user-habits&#34;&gt;Banking Marketing Strategies: Cultivating User Habits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The due date is almost here. First, the Bank of Communications contacted me, offering a one-year free installment payment service with no interest charges. Shortly after, China Merchants Bank also provided installment interest discounts of 2.5% off, equivalent to an annualized interest rate of 1.9%. Faced with these offers, I chose to accept installment services from both banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that banks are truly willing to invest heavily in cultivating user habits. According to the bank’s definition of “flow,” I should be a premium customer. In the current context of difficulty for banks in lending and deploying funds, by fostering my installment awareness, the bank is actually preparing for potential liquidity difficulties that may arise from me in the future, at which point they can earn more interest income from me. After all, as we know, interest rates on credit card bill analysis are not low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks use free installment services and low-interest installment offers to not only increase the frequency and amount of credit card usage but also to establish a positive image in the minds of users. This shift in strategy reflects the bank’s rapid response to market changes and its deep understanding of customer needs. In this way, the bank not only solves the problem of difficulty in lending and deploying funds, but also lays the groundwork for future profits – &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s not just about making money today; looking ahead is key to long-term success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-personal-financial-management&#34;&gt;The Importance of Personal Financial Management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the appealing offers of installment financing from banks, as users, we should recognize the risks associated with over-reliance on credit card installments. We should carefully consider our repayment ability and future financial needs to avoid falling into long-term debt traps due to short-term financial convenience. Key to personal financial management is balancing current needs with future planning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The multifaceted nature of gaming: the intersection of psychological development and social entertainment.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 15:07:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s digital age, games have evolved far beyond a simple form of entertainment and become an integral part of people&amp;rsquo;s daily lives. From a psychological perspective, games play different roles in the mental development of individuals across various age groups, while also being closely intertwined with social and recreational activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-state&#34;&gt;Mental State
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people are in the stage of self-exploration and identity formation. &lt;strong&gt;Games provide them with a low-cost environment to try and explore.&lt;/strong&gt; Through games, they can experiment with different roles and lifestyles, satisfying their curiosity and desire for exploration. As they grow older, individuals’ interests and values gradually stabilize, and games may no longer align with their life goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes&#34;&gt;Social Attributes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the game has also become a part of social activities, particularly for young people. They make friends and build social networks through games, making games a bridge for socialization. However, as people age, their social circles gradually stabilize, and social needs may be met through more mature ways, leading to a relative reduction in the role of games in socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes-bringing-a-sister&#34;&gt;Social Attributes: Bringing a Sister
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within China, due to a lack of education regarding romantic relationships, parents often simply expect you to study diligently and then immediately focus on finding a partner after graduation. This phenomenon is quite common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of busy studies, work, or a lack of social skills, individuals are unable to establish stable emotional relationships in real life, leading to feelings of loneliness and a desire for attention. &lt;strong&gt;The “bringing a sister” behavior within games provides them with an outlet to release this craving.&lt;/strong&gt; By helping and protecting female players, they can experience being needed and valued, achieving emotional satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the interactive rules within games are clearly defined, and the environment is controllable, offering a sense of certainty and security compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real life, reducing fear of the uncertainties in real-life interactions. However, long-term reliance on virtual gratification within games can potentially impact their ability to build and maintain healthy emotional relationships in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-world-pressure&#34;&gt;Real-World Pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games provide a virtual world where players can temporarily escape the pressures, challenges, or unpleasant emotions of real life. Particularly for young people facing academic pressure, family issues, or interpersonal relationship challenges, games may become a way to seek comfort and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are typically designed to give players a sense of accomplishment and recognition when completing tasks, leveling up, or defeating opponents. Young people may become addicted to games because they can experience a feeling of being appreciated and recognized within them – a feeling that may be lacking in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dislike-playing-after-getting-older&#34;&gt;Dislike Playing After Getting Older
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young, individuals face relatively fewer social responsibilities and pressures, allowing them more time and energy to invest in gaming. As they enter the workforce or start families and other social responsibilities increase, time and energy become more valuable, and games may be seen as a drain on resources rather than a prioritized leisure activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, their cognitive abilities and interests also change. They might have been interested in fast-paced, visually stunning games when younger, but with increased experience, they may prefer strategy games, those with strong storylines, or games with greater depth. If the market doesn’t meet these changing needs, interest naturally diminishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Renminbi exchange rate has experienced significant fluctuations, breaking above 7.26.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/renminbi-exchange-rate-volatility/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 00:31:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/renminbi-exchange-rate-volatility/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The fluctuations in the Renminbi exchange rate and the decline in the A-share market may be related to the dynamics of global central banks, the unexpected interest rate cut by the Swiss Central Bank, the performance of U.S. economic data, and adjustments in market expectations regarding inflation and interest rate cuts. These factors jointly acted on the foreign exchange market and stock market, leading to fluctuations in the Renminbi and the decline in the A-share market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the provided link content, on March 22, 2024, the Renminbi experienced significant volatility. Here’s a detailed breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dollar/Offshore RMB Exchange Rate Breaks Through:&lt;/strong&gt; At opening, the Renminbi weakened, with the dollar-offshore RMB rising to a high of 7.24926 and the on-shore RMB rising to a high of 7.22360, both breaking new highs since November 17, 2023. As of the time of release by Lianhe Chat, the dollar-offshore RMB broke through the 7.26 mark, with the lowest reported at 7.2639 and the trend remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central Bank Mid-Exchange Rate Adjustment:&lt;/strong&gt; On March 22nd, the central bank announced the Renminbi’s midpoint exchange rate against the dollar at 7.1004, a devaluation of 62 basis points, with the adjustment magnitude expanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A-Share Market Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; Affected by various factors, the three major A-share indices opened low and continued to fall, with declines exceeding 1% overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons for Volatility in the Foreign Exchange Market:&lt;/strong&gt; A senior foreign exchange trader from a Hong Kong investment institution stated that the volatility in the foreign exchange market was mainly due to the unexpected interest rate cut by the Swiss Central Bank boosting the dollar, coupled with strong U.S. economic data and the potential persistence of inflation delaying interest rate cuts, leading to an increase in the Dollar Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Central Bank Dynamics:&lt;/strong&gt; This week is the “Super Central Bank Week” for global markets, with the central banks of the United States, Japan, Britain, Australia, and other countries all announcing interest rate decisions this week. The Swiss Central Bank unexpectedly announced a cut in interest rates, becoming the first G10 currency central bank to cut rates since the outbreak of the pandemic, which broke the market balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecast for Renminbi Trend:&lt;/strong&gt; Zhou Miaohua, researcher at Light Industry Bank’s Financial Market Department, stated that despite some fluctuations in the Renminbi recently, the overall magnitude is significantly smaller than that of major currencies such as the dollar, and short-term volatility will not change the RMB&amp;rsquo;s trend of steady appreciation throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Python Dictionary Storage of Custom Objects: The Importance of References vs. Deep Copies</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/python-dictionary-custom-objects-reference-vs-deepcopy/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 01:08:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/python-dictionary-custom-objects-reference-vs-deepcopy/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Python programming, a dictionary is a very powerful data structure that allows us to associate key-value pairs and efficiently search and manipulate these data. When we try to store custom objects in a dictionary, we often encounter a crucial concept: In Python, object assignment is actually reference assignment, not a deep copy of the object itself. This means that when you put a custom object into a dictionary, the dictionary stores a reference to that object, rather than a brand new copy of the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-example-of-storing-custom-objects&#34;&gt;Basic Example of Storing Custom Objects
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a simple &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Create a Person object
p1 = Person(&amp;quot;Alice&amp;quot;, 30)

# Store the object in a dictionary
people_dict = {}
people_dict[&amp;quot;alice&amp;quot;] = p1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the &lt;code&gt;people_dict&lt;/code&gt; dictionary now contains an item with a key &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;alice&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and its value is a reference to the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; type object &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt;. If we modify the properties of this object:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;p1.age = 31
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then when accessing this object through the dictionary, we will find that its age has also been updated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;print(people_dict[&amp;quot;alice&amp;quot;].age)  # Output: 31
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the dictionary stores references to &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; objects rather than independent copies of them. It stores a reference to the same memory address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deep-copy-vs-shallow-copy&#34;&gt;Deep Copy vs. Shallow Copy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This referencing behavior can lead to unexpected results when dealing with nested data structures or custom objects. For example, if a custom object contains mutable attributes (such as lists or another custom object), directly storing such an object in a dictionary and modifying it will affect the object obtained through the dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;class Address:
    def __init__(self, street, city):
        self.street = street
        self.city = city

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age, address):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.address = address

address = Address(&amp;quot;Main St.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Springfield&amp;quot;)
p1 = Person(&amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;, 40, address)
people_dict[&amp;quot;bob&amp;quot;] = p1

# Modify the original address object
address.city = &amp;quot;Shelbyville&amp;quot;

# The person in the dictionary&#39;s address also changed
print(people_dict[&amp;quot;bob&amp;quot;].address.city)  # Output: Shelbyville
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution: Deep Copy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid problems caused by shared state, we sometimes need to ensure that the dictionary stores a complete copy of the object, rather than a reference to it. Python provides the &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; module&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; function to achieve this goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import copy

# Use deep copy to store objects
people_dict[&amp;quot;bob_deepcopy&amp;quot;] = copy.deepcopy(p1)

# Now even if you modify the original address object, the deep copied object is not affected
address.city = &amp;quot;Capital City&amp;quot;
print(people_dict[&amp;quot;bob&amp;quot;].address.city)  # Output: Capital City
print(people_dict[&amp;quot;bob_deepcopy&amp;quot;].address.city)  # Output: Shelbyville
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, when using dictionaries to store custom objects in Python, be sure to pay attention to the fact that they default to storing object references. For situations where you need to maintain independent states, use &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; to perform a deep copy to avoid unexpected data changes due to shared referencing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;315 actually did not report on “chicken mud,” and this issue itself has been confusing the official exposure of CCTV’s 3·15 Gala with other food safety hotspots that occurred concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zhihu-answer-journalismhttpswwwzhihucomquestion648967411answer3433834122&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zhihu.com/question/648967411/answer/3433834122&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zhihu Answer: Journalism&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 315 evening event mentioned nine manufacturers, and none of them included potato starch (daoniansan). Now, the major brands that were nominated have lost all heat, while this potato starch – which is a national staple (found on almost every street food corner across China with a large number of stalls, likely the most prevalent) – has been brought out to argue and it feels like potato starch is being entirely scapegoated. I’ve looked at online news sources; CCTV released a report on ham on 3.15, listing only a few manufacturers&amp;rsquo; ingredients, and none of those manufacturers were primarily producers of potato starch. There was nothing obviously wrong with their ingredients, and then this reporter used information from an employee at one factory who said they sometimes use chicken bone meal to substitute for meat – something that was rumored – and she went to inquire on Taobao about pet food suppliers selling chicken bone meal: “Can people eat it?” This isn’t a stupid question, is it? They dare to sell it to pets? Then rumors spread that potato starch contained chicken bone meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, many factories are likely to close down, and tens of thousands of small street vendors across the country face the situation of having goods unsold and no business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-life-on-earth&#34;&gt;Real Life on Earth
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Xiaoxiang Morning News reports on March 17th, the day after the “stuck starch tube collapse” incident in Sanmenxia, Henan, an elderly woman set up a stall selling starch tubes two days later, but after two hours, she still didn’t attract any customers and ultimately quietly ate the starch tubes herself. The photographer said that he himself usually eats four or five starch tubes at once, but after learning that the starch tubes contained chicken bone mud, he refused to eat them. That day, out of curiosity about whether anyone would still buy her sausages after they were exposed, he saw that the vendor hadn’t sold a single tube in two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aunt didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about the starch tube incident; she only knew that suddenly no one was buying her grilled sausages today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elderly woman was right; she was just trying to make a living, and the elderly woman didn’t even know if the product had any problems or whether it was qualified, nor did she know what bone mud was. She didn&amp;rsquo;t know about the internet; she was simply a bottom-level person finding ways to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starch tubes collapsed, but the bill was paid by one after another of bottom-level vendors. It’s a painful process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zhihu-answer-regulatory-issueshttpswwwzhihucomquestion648967411answer3433978475&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zhihu.com/question/648967411/answer/3433978475&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zhihu Answer: Regulatory Issues&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, during an afternoon, my colleague who was working in Beijing and I went to have lunch. We passed by a small stall selling sausages and sizzling beef skewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blurted out, “With all this black technology starch sausage and sizzling beef, are people even going to eat it?” Because in my view, the last time I ate a starch-based ham sausage was probably about fifteen years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague hesitated and then said tactfully, &amp;ldquo;Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve been living in a big city. Actually, in our hometown, pickled cabbage, instant noodles, and ham sausages are everyday staples.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I was in school, my dad would only let me have a sausage on the road if I got full marks. It wasn’t because they were unhygienic; sausages simply cost 1.5 yuan, enough to buy two pounds of vegetables.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way we call instant noodles, carbonated drinks, and spicy strips ‘junk food’ – I only learned about that after coming to Beijing for school.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized how arrogant my casual words had been and stopped talking. But this incident left a deep impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this is the daily life of most Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lives don&amp;rsquo;t include fancy “Mediterranean diets,” “green organic vegetables,” or “non-GMO soybeans.” They only care about whether they can buy some cheap and delicious vegetables, meat, and snacks, and enjoy the few moments of happiness their families have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re curious about what ingredients make up the things on shelves, whether they might harm their health, and if there are any strange chemical components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simply not something they should be concerned with or understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They simply believe that if there’s a problem, someone should be in charge, and it shouldn’t appear on the shelves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after watching a 315 episode, we realized that wasn’t the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-tech modifications were found in electronic scales and gasoline pumps, requiring YouTubers to take videos risking beatings to expose them, allowing regulators to “suddenly realize” and investigate;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pork belly and starch sausages sold on live streams and small stalls turned out to be made with rotten meat and bone meal, requiring CCTV reporters to go undercover and film before anyone verified the source and tracked it down;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Health wines” heavily promoted on television and airport advertisements needed someone to expose their entire backstory through videos before they were urgently removed overnight, disappearing from the public’s sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a year&amp;rsquo;s 315 event, every six or seven products are randomly pulled – is that enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you find those who have already eaten or bought them?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Want your home network to be lightning fast? The key is understanding cable selection, optical terminals (ONTs), and router configuration, as well as those seemingly insignificant details. This blog post will guide you through easily learning how to build a gigabit network using six types of cables, and how to ensure your network speed isn&amp;rsquo;t restricted by simple device checks and configurations. Let’s explore together and make your home network fly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-an-in-depth-analysis-of-network-transmission-media&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: An In-Depth Analysis of Network Transmission Media
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When discussing achieving gigabit network access, the carrier that supports high-speed information transmission – cables – plays a crucial role. Below we will provide detailed interpretations of Cat5, Cat6, and Cat7 cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-five-category-cables-cat5&#34;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Five-Category Cables (CAT5)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAT5 cables, also known as CAT5, are an earlier and more widely adopted type of twisted pair cable. Each pair of wire pairs is designed with a precise helical structure to reduce crosstalk. It’s primarily used for 10/100Mbps Fast Ethernet, with a maximum transmission frequency of approximately 100MHz. While it was once widely applied, CAT5 cables cannot meet current demands for gigabit and even higher speeds due to physical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-six-category-cables-cat6&#34;&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Six-Category Cables (CAT6)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the development of technology, six-category cables have emerged. Compared to five-category cables, six-cable materials adopted stricter manufacturing standards and more advanced structural designs, significantly improving anti-interference capability and transmission efficiency, supporting data transfer rates up to 1Gbps, and with a transmission distance of up to 100 meters under ideal conditions, which perfectly meets the access requirements of Gigabit networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-seven-category-cables-cat7&#34;&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Seven-Category Cables (CAT7)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven-category cables represent the current cutting edge of twisted pair cabling technology. It not only offers a significant leap in transmission rates, theoretically supporting speeds up to 10Gbps, but also incorporates a complete shielding system, including shielding between each pair and overall external shielding, which greatly reduces external electromagnetic interference and near-end crosstalk, ensuring data transmission stability and accuracy. However, CAT7 cables are primarily used for future 10 Gigabit Ethernet or specific high-requirement scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When setting up a gigabit home network environment, choosing six-category cables is the most economical and efficient choice to fully unleash the potential of the gigabit fiber optic.  Furthermore, ensuring that all cabling materials meet quality standards and strictly adhering to standard wiring practices are also crucial elements in guaranteeing network performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-two-deep-dive-into-core-network-devices--the-impact-of-optical-cat-pon-and-router-lan-port-bandwidth&#34;&gt;Chapter Two: Deep Dive into Core Network Devices – The Impact of Optical Cat (PON) and Router LAN Port Bandwidth
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-importance-of-optical-cat-ont-and-its-lan-port-bandwidth&#34;&gt;The Importance of Optical Cat (ONT) and its LAN Port Bandwidth
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Optical Cat, or Optical Network Terminal (ONT), is the core device for home broadband access. Its function is to convert optical signals from fiber optic cables into digital signals for use by home network devices. For users with gigabit fiber connections, whether the ONT supports gigabit transmission is particularly important. If the ONT’s WAN port only supports 100 Mbps, even if the incoming fiber rate is high, it will be limited to 100 Mbps due to this bottleneck. Similarly, the ONT’s LAN port also needs to have a gigabit output capability; otherwise, routers or other devices connected to it cannot obtain the true gigabit rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-role-of-bandwidth-on-router-lan-ports&#34;&gt;The Role of Bandwidth on Router LAN Ports
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The router’s LAN ports are responsible for distributing the data received to various terminal devices. When a router&amp;rsquo;s LAN port is only 100 Mbps, even if other devices are configured well, it can only achieve 100 Mbps local network communication. Therefore, when building a Gigabit home network, it’s crucial to ensure that the router’s WAN port can receive 1 Gbps data and that the LAN ports also provide data output capabilities at the Gigabit level, allowing all smart devices in your home to enjoy the smooth experience brought by high-speed networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that some older or low-end routers may have a LAN port rate auto-negotiation mechanism, which means that even if the router itself supports 1 Gbps, it might be downgraded to 100 Mbps mode due to cable issues, device compatibility, and other factors. Therefore, correctly configuring router parameters, enabling forced Gigabit mode, and pairing it with a Gigabit switch or direct connection devices are key steps in achieving a full Gigabit network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After upgrading to gigabit fiber optic, be sure to check and replace them with a gigabit optical gateway and a gigabit router, ensuring that all device interfaces reach the Gigabit level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-three-the-hidden-mystery--how-a-broken-subline-impacts-gigabit-network-speed&#34;&gt;Chapter Three: The Hidden Mystery – How a Broken Subline Impacts Gigabit Network Speed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;line-fault-and-network-performance-degradation&#34;&gt;Line Fault and Network Performance Degradation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the speed tests, the network consistently maintained a connection without any apparent disconnects. As it was a newly deployed broadband for residential customers, the distribution box was cluttered with equipment, and the technician frequently adjusted the fiber optic ONT’s cabling and power adapter placements. This occasionally resulted in speed test results reaching gigabit speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the previous analysis, we had already investigated and ruled out network cable types and ONT LAN port speeds. Ultimately, the culprit was discovered to be a brown sub-cable within the network cable that had fractured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of the break: When the technician installed the crystal head, he applied a little too much force, causing one of the sub-cables to snap in half. It wasn’t completely severed, and subsequent adjustments to the ONT position caused it to eventually break off entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;six-category-cable-lines-function-analysis&#34;&gt;Six Category Cable Lines Function Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six category cables adhere to the TIA/EIA-568-B standard and contain eight twisted pairs of wires, color-coded as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Orange / Orange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Green / Green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Blue / Blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Brown / Brown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the standard of Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-T), these eight lines consist of four pairs working simultaneously, with the following division of labor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The White Orange and Orange pair of wires (1&amp;amp;2) is used for transmitting data (Tx+/-);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The White Green and Green pair of wires (3&amp;amp;6) is used for receiving data (Rx+/-);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The White Blue and Blue pair of wires (4&amp;amp;5) and the White Brown and Brown pair of wires (7&amp;amp;8) were not originally primary in Gigabit Ethernet, but may be enabled in certain advanced applications (such as some PoE power delivery or future technology expansions). In traditional 100 Mbps networks, only four lines – 1, 2, 3, and 6 – could be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;impact-of-breakaway-pairs-on-network-speed&#34;&gt;Impact of Breakaway Pairs on Network Speed
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above scenarios, if a brown sub-cable (i.e., a brown or brown-white wire) breaks, theoretically it will cause speed degradation in gigabit networks, as gigabit networks require all four pairs of wires to transmit bidirectionally simultaneously to achieve full speed. However, due to the automatic negotiation function often found in home network devices, when a cable issue is detected, they will revert to a lower operating mode that can still function normally, namely 100 Mbps mode. This explains why even with a broken sub-cable, the network remains connected and operates at 100 Mbps speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, while a broken brown sub-cable does not affect the basic operation of a 100 Mbps network, it can become a key limiting factor for network speed in a gigabit environment. Until thorough diagnostics and repairs are performed, the full potential of a gigabit fiber optic cable cannot be realized. This also reminds us that when encountering similar situations, we should not ignore any potential network infrastructure issues, even seemingly minor faults that do not affect basic connectivity, as they can become hidden obstacles to high-speed network performance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WPF UI Thread Blocking Issues and Solutions</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wpf-ui-thread-and-freezing-solutions/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 07:12:21 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wpf-ui-thread-and-freezing-solutions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When developing desktop applications, particularly when using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework to build rich client applications, properly handling the user interface (UI) thread is crucial for ensuring the application’s smoothness and responsiveness. The UI thread, also known as the main thread, is the core thread responsible for processing window and control events, layout calculations, and rendering the UI. Any interaction with UI elements should be executed on the UI thread; this is a fundamental principle followed by WPF and most other GUI frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-ui-thread&#34;&gt;What is the UI Thread?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UI thread is created by the operating system when a WPF application starts and initializes the main application window. It’s the only thread within the application that can directly access and modify the state of UI components. This means all user interactions, such as button clicks, text box input, and window size changes, are processed in this thread context. Furthermore, WPF&amp;rsquo;s dependency property system, data binding mechanism, and layout logic are all synchronized on the UI thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;screen-stuttering-and-its-causes&#34;&gt;Screen Stuttering and Its Causes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the UI thread is heavily occupied or blocked for an extended period, such as when performing time-consuming calculations, loading large amounts of data, database queries, or other I/O-intensive tasks, it becomes unable to promptly respond to user interaction requests. This results in the UI freezing – what we commonly refer to as &amp;ldquo;stuttering.&amp;rdquo; In this situation, users will noticeably feel the application&amp;rsquo;s lag and lack of fluidity, and in severe cases, an “Application Not Responding” (ANR) warning may appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;two-basic-rules-for-the-ui-thread&#34;&gt;Two Basic Rules for the UI Thread
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid the above scenarios, WPF developers should adhere to the following two key rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not perform time-consuming operations on the UI thread:&lt;/strong&gt; Any operation that could cause the UI thread to block should be moved to a background thread as much as possible to ensure the UI thread can promptly respond to user input and render screen changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not directly update UI elements from non-UI threads:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to WPF’s security mechanism design, only the UI thread has permission to modify UI elements. Attempting to change UI state directly from another thread will throw an exception. Therefore, even if a background thread completes calculations or data preparation, you must use appropriate cross-thread communication mechanisms to display the results on the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions-asynchronous-programming-and-thread-safe-updates&#34;&gt;Solutions: Asynchronous Programming and Thread-Safe Updates
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To execute time-consuming tasks while maintaining UI fluency, WPF provides various asynchronous programming models and tools to assist developers in achieving this goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispatcher Object:&lt;/strong&gt; The WPF Dispatcher class allows you to schedule work items into the UI thread&amp;rsquo;s task queue for execution. You can use the &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher.Invoke&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher.BeginInvoke&lt;/code&gt; methods to safely update the UI from a background thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;async/await Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; Leveraging C#’s asynchronous features, you can write asynchronous methods and utilize the &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keyword within them to wait for background tasks to complete, automatically returning to the UI thread to execute subsequent UI update code upon completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-studies&#34;&gt;Case Studies
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;updating-the-ui-using-dispatcherinvoke-method&#34;&gt;Updating the UI using &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher.Invoke&lt;/code&gt; method
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    // Assume this is a time-consuming operation
    Task.Run(() =&amp;gt;
    {
        var result = LongRunningOperation(); // This is a simulated long-running calculation method
        
        // When the time-consuming operation is complete, update the UI on the UI thread
        Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(() =&amp;gt;
        {
            LabelStatus.Text = $&amp;quot;Calculation Result: {result}&amp;quot;;
        });
    });
}

private string LongRunningOperation()
{
    // Simulate a long-running operation
    Thread.Sleep(5000);
    return &amp;quot;Completed&amp;quot;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-the-asyncawait-keyword-with-taskrun&#34;&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt; keyword with &lt;code&gt;Task.Run&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;private async void Button_ClickAsync(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    Button button = sender as Button;
    button.IsEnabled = false; // Prevent duplicate clicks by the user

    try
    {
        // Start a background task
        var result = await Task.Run(() =&amp;gt; LongRunningOperation());

        // Automatically switch back to the UI thread to update the UI after the background task completes
        LabelStatus.Text = $&amp;quot;Calculation Result: {result}&amp;quot;;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        MessageBox.Show($&amp;quot;An error occurred: {ex.Message}&amp;quot;);
    }
    finally
    {
        button.IsEnabled = true; // Re-enable the button
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Upgrading the GCC version caused program crashes: hidden issues due to code non-compliance.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/gcc-upgrade-causes-program-crash-code-irregularities/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 23:19:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/gcc-upgrade-causes-program-crash-code-irregularities/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the same business code scenario, the program compiled and ran normally in a CentOS 7 environment. However, when switching to CentOS 8 and using an updated version of GCC for compilation, the program crashed. It’s worth noting that the issue only occurs in &lt;strong&gt;Release mode&lt;/strong&gt;, while &lt;strong&gt;Debug mode&lt;/strong&gt; does not exhibit any problems. This is the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve encountered a situation like this; after three days of investigation, we finally identified the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;problem-identification&#34;&gt;Problem Identification
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After investigation, the root cause of the issue was &lt;strong&gt;the function lacked a return value&lt;/strong&gt;. In Release mode, new versions of GCC perform more optimizations, which caused an unknown logic to occur within the function that originally did not have an explicit return value during execution, ultimately triggering a crash. Our conclusion is that &lt;strong&gt;compiler warnings should not be ignored, especially in legacy projects where some warnings may be dismissed, but it’s also important to avoid suppressing all warnings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;environment-details&#34;&gt;Environment Details
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CentOS 7 GCC Version:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CentOS 8 GCC Version:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crash-phenomena&#34;&gt;Crash Phenomena
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When analyzing the stack information for program crashes, we observed the following stack details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;[New LWP 1385902]
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library &amp;quot;/lib64/libthread_db.so.1&amp;quot;.
Core was generated by `./pstack_main`.
Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x00007ffe894b4420 in ?? ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007ffe894b4420 in ?? ()
#1  0x00000000004008e9 in main ()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stack doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear intuitive; the crash function’s stack information shows a &lt;code&gt;??&lt;/code&gt;, which makes troubleshooting even more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;code-example&#34;&gt;Code Example
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the issue, here is a minimal code example that reproduces the crash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;map&amp;gt;

int test() {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
}

int main() {
    test();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function in this code clearly does not explicitly return a value, and its return type is &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. According to the C++ standard, when a function is declared as an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; type, it must have a return value, otherwise it may lead to undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compilation-warning&#34;&gt;Compilation Warning
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our project, the CMake script suppresses many compile-time warnings, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;/root/pstack/main.cpp: In function ‘int test()’:
/root/pstack/main.cpp:7:1: warning: no return statement in function returning non-void [-Wreturn-type]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This warning indicates that the &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function does not return a value, which is the root cause of the problem. Newer versions of GCC (such as 8.5.0) may make unstable optimizations with this undefined behavior when optimizing code, potentially leading to program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;assembly-code-differences&#34;&gt;Assembly Code Differences
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain the differences in GCC compiler optimization behavior, we compared assembly code generated by different versions of GCC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GCC 4.8.5 Generated Assembly Code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembly code is relatively verbose and includes handling logic for standard output streams (such as &lt;code&gt;std::cout&lt;/code&gt;). This indicates that the compiler performed more conservative optimizations, not optimizing excessively for the missing return value issue in the &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function, possibly to avoid a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GCC 8.5.0 Generated Assembly Code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version of GCC performed more optimizations, reducing the code volume. However, this optimization may have resulted in unpredictable behavior when executing functions without returning values, leading to program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this troubleshooting process, we deeply realized that in C++, &lt;strong&gt;function return values must be explicit&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly when a function is declared as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, a return value must be provided. When upgrading from older versions of compilers to newer versions of GCC, more optimization and stricter warning mechanisms may be encountered. Therefore, we recommend not &lt;strong&gt;disabling all warnings&lt;/strong&gt; during compilation, but rather selectively addressing them, especially common issues such as function return values and type matching.
Ultimately, by adding a return value to the &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function, the problem was resolved, and the program returned to normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>VMware Virtual Machine CPU Resource Usage Anomaly</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-machine-cpu-usage-anomaly/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 22:14:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-machine-cpu-usage-anomaly/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The business system, running in Windows version, is deployed locally and consumes approximately 5% of CPU resources. The Linux version of the business system, deployed within a VMware-installed CentOS8 environment, exhibits abnormal resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-description&#34;&gt;Problem Description
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host Machine: Windows 10 Enterprise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VMware: 17.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual Machine: CentOS8
The virtual machine resource allocation is &lt;code&gt;4C8GB&lt;/code&gt;, running the business system. The business system is deployed in the Linux system within the virtual machine, and the internal top command observes system resource usage. CPU utilization is not high, while the external Windows system’s Task Manager shows very high CPU resource consumption. Examining processes reveals that the VMware process consumes a large amount of CPU resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;+
|         Windows           |
|                           |
|   +&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;+  |
|   |      VMware        |  |
|   |      Program       |  |
|   +&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;+  |
|                           |
+&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;+&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-concepts&#34;&gt;Key Concepts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting this issue wasn’t smooth, as the root cause wasn&amp;rsquo;t the business system itself but the virtual machine. How to shift thinking from conventional business code to system load, then from abnormal load data to pinpoint a soft interrupt, and finally arrive at the critical point – what factors affect VMware soft interrupt efficiency? This article will first introduce various concepts and then provide solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hyper-v&#34;&gt;Hyper-V
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virtualization technology for Windows operating systems underwent a significant transformation. When Microsoft initially released WSL, enabling the Hyper-V service would prevent VMware virtual machines from working simultaneously. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until subsequent versions that VMware could be compatible with the Hyper-V service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;system-load&#34;&gt;System Load
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Linux systems, &amp;ldquo;load&amp;rdquo; refers to the number of processes currently running or waiting to be executed. The load is typically represented by three numbers: the average process count in the run queue over 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes respectively. These numbers can be viewed by running the &lt;code&gt;uptime&lt;/code&gt; command or the &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, these three numbers represent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-minute load:&lt;/strong&gt; The average number of processes in the run queue over the past 1 minute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5-minute load:&lt;/strong&gt; The average number of processes in the run queue over the past 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15-minute load:&lt;/strong&gt; The average number of processes in the run queue over the past 15 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of the load is the number of processes waiting to be executed within the system. If this number exceeds the logical CPU count for the system, it indicates a high system load, meaning many processes are waiting for processor resources. This can cause the system to become slow or unresponsive, depending on the severity of the load and the configuration and performance of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the load should remain within the logical CPU count range to optimize system performance. If the load consistently exceeds the CPU count, it may be necessary to further analyze processes in the system to identify the cause of the high load and take appropriate measures to adjust system resource allocation or optimize how processes run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analyzing-load-with-mpstat&#34;&gt;Analyzing Load with mpstat
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; command is used to report multiple pieces of information about one or more processors, including average load, CPU utilization, interrupts, and context switches. Within the &lt;code&gt;sysstat&lt;/code&gt; package, &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; is a valuable tool for analyzing system load conditions.  Here&amp;rsquo;s how to perform load analysis using &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install sysstat:&lt;/strong&gt;
If &lt;code&gt;sysstat&lt;/code&gt; isn’t installed on your system, use your system&amp;rsquo;s package manager to install it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run mpstat:&lt;/strong&gt;
Use the &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; command to view CPU usage and load. By default, &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; displays CPU utilization averages once per second. You can adjust the output frequency by specifying an interval. For example, to run &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; at a rate of one time per second, use the following command: &lt;code&gt;mpstat -P ALL 2&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; represents interrupt resource usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyze Output:&lt;/strong&gt;
The output from &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; includes CPU utilization for each processor, as well as the system&amp;rsquo;s average load. Pay particular attention to the average load and the utilization of each CPU to understand the system’s load conditions. If the load is high, further analysis can be done to determine which processes are causing it and whether there are any performance bottlenecks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combine with Other Tools:&lt;/strong&gt;
In addition to &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt;, you can use tools like &lt;code&gt;sar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pidstat&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;iostat&lt;/code&gt; to comprehensively analyze system performance. By combining the outputs of multiple tools, you can gain a more complete understanding of the system’s load conditions and identify the root causes of performance issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interrupt&#34;&gt;Interrupt
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section doesn&amp;rsquo;t elaborate on the content too much,
Recommended: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.codedump.info/post/20200522-sgfap-softirq/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;System Guide for Application Developers - CPU Part - Soft Interrupt&lt;/a&gt;
Frequent triggering of soft interrupts will also be reflected in system load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that analysis solely from the CPU perspective couldn’t pinpoint the issue, should we start to suspect that the system had become abnormal? It might be due to excessive load on the Linux operating system, causing VMware to consume an unusually high amount of CPU resources. By using &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; to analyze local virtual machines, we found that &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; utilization was abnormally high, approaching 25% per core, while in normal circumstances, when business processes were idle, &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; should have accounted for approximately 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a colleague’s development environment within the group, his CentOS 7 was deployed on VMware with normal resource usage. Conversely, in the Shanghai development environment, although also running on VMware, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t directly observe the host machine’s CPU resource situation. At this point, we faced multiple variables: VMware virtual machines, the Linux operating system, and the GCC version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting our focus to the test environment, the Shenzhen test environment was deployed on a physical machine running low-version GCC compiled services and was running on CentOS 8. Interestingly, in the Shenzhen environment, &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; utilization was normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate potential issues introduced by the GCC version, we deployed a program compiled with a high-version GCC to the Shenzhen environment for testing, which also yielded normal results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem seemed to become clearer, and we began to suspect that the operating system might be experiencing an issue. After all, CentOS 8 is no longer officially supported. Even after deploying clean CentOS 7 and CentOS 8, the problem persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we started to suspect the only remaining uncertainty: the VMware virtual machine software itself. Suddenly, a flash of insight occurred – could we have inadvertently enabled Hyper-V previously without fully disabling it, thereby causing this issue? After all, interrupts are also implemented through virtualization software. Do different virtualization technologies have bugs? These questions deserved in-depth consideration and investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Microsoft official documentation, after completely disabling the Hyper-V service on the machine as described, VMware recovered normal operation on the host. This finally resolved the issue. As initially stated, this experience was convoluted and arduous, requiring comprehensive analysis and judgment. It was also our first time troubleshooting and pinpointing the problem down to the virtual machine level.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>C&#43;&#43; Programming Traps: A Detailed Explanation of Program Crashes Caused by Improper Use of `std::map`</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-programming-traps-std-map-crash-details/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 22:03:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-programming-traps-std-map-crash-details/</guid>
        <description>e&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the C++ standard library, &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt; is an associative container that stores elements in ascending order of keys (key) and provides efficient keyword lookup functionality. However, novice developers sometimes fall into trouble because they misunderstand the behavior of the square bracket operator &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, when using &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; to access a non-existent key, &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt; inserts a new key-value pair, and the default constructor will be used to initialize the value type corresponding to that key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;map&amp;gt;

int main() {
    std::map&amp;lt;std::string, int&amp;gt; myMap;

    // Incorrect usage: assuming here that we are trying to access a non-existent key and assume it will return 0
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Value for &#39;nonexistent_key&#39;: &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; myMap[&amp;quot;nonexistent_key&amp;quot;] &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

    // In fact, the above line of code creates a new key-value pair, where the value is initialized by the default constructor of int (usually 0)
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the above code does not directly cause the program to crash, this implicit insertion behavior can lead to unexpected side effects in some cases, such as resource leaks or changes that do not meet expectations. Worse still, in a multithreaded environment, concurrent access to uninitialized memory areas may even cause the program to crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent these problems, it is recommended to use &lt;code&gt;std::map::find()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;std::map::count()&lt;/code&gt; methods to check if the key exists, or explicitly insert elements using &lt;code&gt;std::map::insert()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;std::map&amp;lt;std::string, int&amp;gt; safeMap;
if (safeMap.count(&amp;quot;nonexistent_key&amp;quot;) == 0) {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Key does not exist.&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Value for existing key: &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; safeMap[&amp;quot;nonexistent_key&amp;quot;] &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
}

// Or explicitly insert a key-value pair, specifying the initial value
safeMap.insert({ &amp;quot;new_key&amp;quot;, 0 });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the map container stores objects of pointer type, the implicit insertion behavior will save an uninitialized pointer, and any operation on this pointer will cause the program to crash.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>pstack troubleshoot a hung process</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/pstack-troubleshooting-process-hangs/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 23:55:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/pstack-troubleshooting-process-hangs/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In software development and operations, deadlocked processes are frequently encountered. This situation can lead to performance degradation or service unavailability. This article introduces how to use the pstack tool to troubleshoot deadlocked process issues by analyzing process stack information to identify the root cause and resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: A child service within the risk control system experienced a deadlocked state, resulting in the unavailability of the risk control service. Due to the lack of service availability monitoring, the deadlocked process situation was not detected in a timely manner, leading to system unavailability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hung process refers to a process that has stopped responding but hasn&amp;rsquo;t exited. This situation can be caused by various reasons, such as deadlocks, resource exhaustion, or exceptions. To resolve these issues, we can use the &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool to analyze the process’s stack information and identify the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps&#34;&gt;Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; is a commonly used tool, often provided alongside &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; (GNU Debugger). You can install it using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get install gdb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obtain Process ID: First, we need to obtain the process ID (PID) of the zombie process. We can use the &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; command to list all processes and find the PID of the process we want to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool to analyze the process stack. Once you have obtained the process ID, you can use the &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool to retrieve the stack information for that process. Run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;pstack &amp;lt;PID&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will output the stack information of the process, displaying the sequence of function calls currently being executed. By analyzing this information, you can identify where the process is stuck and subsequently pinpoint the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyze Stack Information: By examining the stack information, you can find the cause of the process becoming zombie. You may discover deadlock situations, infinite loops, or other abnormal conditions. Take appropriate measures based on the specific situation, such as releasing locks, fixing code logic, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-study&#34;&gt;Case Study
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple demo, after the main function starts, a child thread is created and the actual function enters an infinite loop, causing the program to fail to terminate normally and enter a state of false death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0.0)
project(pstack_main VERSION 0.1.0 LANGUAGES C CXX)

include(CTest)
enable_testing()

# Find the Threads library
find_package(Threads REQUIRED)

add_executable(pstack_main main.cpp)

# Link with the Threads library

set(CPACK_PROJECT_NAME ${PROJECT_NAME})
set(CPACK_PROJECT_VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION})
include(CPack)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;thread&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;chrono&amp;gt;

void infiniteLoop() {
    while (true) {
        // Main thread enters an infinite loop
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread thread(infiniteLoop); // Create a thread to execute the infinite loop function
    thread.join(); // Wait for the thread to end
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the program, and examining the &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;Thread 2 (Thread 0x7eff3619b700 (LWP 1315017)):

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be seen that the program is in a false death state because of the infinite loop, the main thread enters an infinite loop, and the child thread cannot&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting out for a walk is always good.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/come-out-for-a-walk-is-good/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 10:30:43 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/come-out-for-a-walk-is-good/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If things had gone as the family planned, I would have stuck to studying power grids honestly and diligently, without venturing into coding. Had I erased the dust from my memory, it all stemmed from a chat with my roommate near the Spring Festival, which led to a review of my experiences over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-one&#34;&gt;Chapter One
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the &lt;em&gt;gaokao&lt;/em&gt; (national college entrance examination) couldn’t be described as good or bad; I got into a 211 university, and according to Dad&amp;rsquo;s original plan, I should have studied power grids and returned to work for the local electricity supply bureau. Earlier accounts had also mentioned how to gradually transition onto the IT path – something that hadn’t been fully articulated before: financial perspective and self-discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my education in a rural school, and after primary school two, my family arranged for me to transfer to a school in the city district. Like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden, I initially struggled to adapt to the bustling prosperity of the city. I hadn’t been to the cinema very often, and specifically, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone with my parents, but relatives would take me. Heaven always bestows luck upon you; back then, I met a few like-minded friends, though we lost contact later on. Looking back, that period of youth was truly wonderful. After weekend tutoring, we’d clean out the classroom plastic bottles, quickly stepping on them to flatten and pack them into our backpacks to take home for Mom to save up – accumulating them until they were enough to find a waste collector to handle disposal. We&amp;rsquo;d play chess, badminton, and Mahjong together, with push-ups as punishment for losing, which we still felt a little fortunate about; Dad had been taking me through various exercises since childhood. From this point on, my financial perspective was slightly skewed, I felt somewhat inferior, but these small misfortunes quickly passed. Our family wasn’t struggling financially, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t have much pocket money, sometimes couldn’t join our classmates in their activities, especially on weekends. Seeing our parents’ efforts as they moved us from the village to the city. At this time, the seed had been planted, waiting for it to sprout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My simple-minded self was generally very happy during my studies, much like many graduates can only appreciate after graduation – studying wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a difficult task; the investment and output converted relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-one-1&#34;&gt;Chapter One
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I layered in the memories of the Age of Empires, and during university, I encountered a laptop – it was like Pandora’s Box opening, introducing me to games and connecting me with game merchants. Initially, I was a low-level salesperson, sourcing goods upstream and selling them through my own community channels, earning a little money. Later, I gradually understood the operational logic of the entire chain. The products we sold were simply mass-produced by upstream programs, and their costs approached zero. At this point, the road had already started to veer off course; there were further subdivisions within the field – on the left was power grids, and on the right was automation (very complex, chip programming, factory electrical automation) – I realized that software could make money, but it wasn’t much. Although the upstream channels did earn a lot, combined with my previous background in programming, I started tinkering here and there, making a little money. When choosing between specialized fields, I naturally chose automation. After finishing my third year of coursework, I didn&amp;rsquo;t attend many classes, constantly thinking about writing code to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in last year’s article, inspired by the beautiful vision of hackers, I came into programming through self-study – I learned assembly language, penetration testing, game cheats, DLL hijacking, and data theft, familiarizing myself with various blackware and greyware. My parents taught me how to be a good person, and the law ultimately dissuaded me from going too far down that path; the road didn’t completely deviate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1&#34;&gt;Chapter 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous Post Link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/that-boy-talent-maybe-but-not-much/&#34; &gt;That Time When I Was Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also talked about a brief romance during university. Looking back, it was mostly longing for the love depicted in television dramas. As an immature mind at the time, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand how to love someone, let alone achieve: settling down and starting a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-two&#34;&gt;Chapter Two
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst the torrent of times, I was fortunate – university’s tribulations led me to not pursue graduate studies; I immediately entered employment and enjoyed a smooth career path riding the wave of IT. It&amp;rsquo;s now my eighth year in this profession, but the hype money vanished as the industry matured, leading to its decline. Sometimes, I question whether my initial choice was correct – perhaps entering the power grid as suggested by my father would have been a better option. Such thoughts might linger during the first five years of employment, but they gradually fade away with time. My recruitment into HSBC lasted five years without a change of company, which resulted in certain deficiencies regarding technical understanding, industry knowledge, and self-awareness. Following arrangements from the Hangzhou headquarters, I relocated to the Shenzhen branch, experiencing a workplace struggle (which, upon reflection, proved detrimental to both sides – ultimately benefiting the board) fueled by my passion for technology. I returned to Hangzhou with a youthful exuberance, only to later withdraw and head to Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I planned to settle in Hangzhou, register, and purchase property during the highest interest rates and peak housing prices, risking being trapped; my finances were limited, making it impossible to bear the burden of mortgage payments, compounded by an industry downturn, leading to emotional instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-three&#34;&gt;Chapter Three
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having been around for so many years, having seen so much, I’ve made my own mistakes and wasted time. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m doing well. Through experiences and through people, one inevitably grows and matures. If I were to remain at home all the time, I don’t know what form my flaws would manifest in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Designed a行情 SDK, implementing different callback function implementations, and performed an extensive test. Recently I’ve been looking into C++ function programming, where functions have become first-class citizens, flowing within the program internally – what&amp;rsquo;s the difference in performance?&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/little-endian-storage-why/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Regarding byte order: A layman&amp;rsquo;s explanation &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://example.com/post/2023/01-10-%e4%b8%bb%e6%9c%ba%e5%ba%8f%e3%80%81%e7%bd%91%e7%bb%9c%e5%ba%8f%ef%bc%8c%e9%80%9a%e8%bf%87%e8%b0%83%e8%af%95%e5%99%a8%ef%bc%8c%e7%9b%b4%e6%8e%a5%e8%a7%82%e5%af%9f&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Host Order, Network Order, observed directly via debugger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of computer science, certain design habits have formed due to historical reasons, just like the width of a hip dictates the width of a rocket&amp;rsquo;s thrusters – there’s no need to rigidly analyze their “advantages” and “disadvantages”; it’s simply a matter of historical convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the translation of the provided text into English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Mining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the current situation is a result of historical habits plus commercialization, and it has little to do with technology itself. ARM can be set up as big-endian or little-endian. The TCP/IP header still uses big-endian (network byte order). There are also many storage protocols/specifications that use big-endian to store data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the three questions posed by the user seem incorrect in today&amp;rsquo;s view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do computers generally adopt little-endian storage? –&amp;gt; Incorrect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is storing the low byte in a little-endian manner more efficient than in a big-endian manner? –&amp;gt; Efficiency will not be higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any argument about these three questions using current technology is like shooting an arrow first and then drawing the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we say that the choice of big-endian or little-endian did have some objective factors in the history of computer development: The advantage of host-byte order (little-endian) is that a 8-bit * 4 adder can be easily made, requiring only an 8-bit adder to sequentially add all bytes from low to high, and the carry circuit is very simple. If it were big-endian, it would require loading 32 bits once, which cannot perform calculations. Nowadays, the difference between loading 8 bits or 32 bits is not significant, but in the early days when storage prices were expensive, simplicity was always preferred, so the host-byte order chose little-endian based on cost considerations. The advantage of network byte order (big-endian) is that early devices had very small caches. Taking the high byte first could quickly determine the message information: packet length (need to prepare how much cache), address range (IP addresses are matched from front to back). Early network devices&amp;rsquo; caches were at the byte level, and taking the high byte was indeed a little faster. Therefore, network devices used big-endian based on cost considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the choice of byte order has historically been more influenced by application scenarios and costs (such as PPC/MIPS being more suitable for network devices), and the configuration of big-endness and little-endness has been carried over to this day due to compatibility reasons. In today&amp;rsquo;s view, these advantages no longer exist, they are merely historical habits.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I was feeling the urge to browse for new wallpapers, sticking with my usual black series, with some areas colored in, and the desktop needing to display icons. Other color schemes would result in blurry icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stared at the assembly code, trying to figure it out, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand it. I tried throwing it to an &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, explaining the instructions, but it failed to explain the context – clearly, this was a command used for a specific scenario. Regular code isn’t like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; was no longer as useful as a search engine at this point; its knowledge base of assembly language was insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanation&#34;&gt;Explanation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;TrapFlag&lt;/code&gt; is a flag bit in the register file. When this flag is set, it throws an exception &lt;code&gt;SINGLE_STEP&lt;/code&gt;. Because when we trace the code, this flag will be cleared by the debugger, so we won&amp;rsquo;t see this exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In actual testing, if you directly step over detecting functions, debugging will not be detected. Only when entering the detection function to execute will it be detected (based on research materials, yet to be verified in practice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese related materials are based on the English articles from websites, which introduce many anti-debugging techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Download Focus News/CCTV Video Files</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-download-focus-interview-cctv-videos/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:23:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-download-focus-interview-cctv-videos/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, someone asked how to download Focus Interview videos. My mind immediately went to the usual – eight or nine out of ten times it’s encrypted using an &lt;code&gt;m3u8&lt;/code&gt; method, and a bit of simple processing is all it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;downloader&#34;&gt;Downloader
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-CLI&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-CLI&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;code&gt;m3u8 downloader&lt;/code&gt; is an open-source command-line m3u8/HLS/dash downloader that supports ordinary AES-128-CBC decryption, multi-threading, custom request headers, etc. Supports Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and English. English Supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;browser-extensions&#34;&gt;Browser Extensions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ngjclnbcdbahekojpkhancmiobdahemb&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Live Stream Downloader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;honeyed-confidence&#34;&gt;Honeyed Confidence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the address, assuming it was solved, turned out to be nothing – unable to parse segments normally, query information, and discover that the official had processed the download address, requiring manual replacement of the &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; parsed by the plugin into the following links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;https://newcntv.qcloudcdn.com/asp/hls/2000/0303000a/3/default/***********************/2000.m3u8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of January 2024, the address is still valid; if there are any changes in the future, analyze the webpage independently.
Historical Address Backup: &lt;code&gt;https://hlswx.cntv.kcdnvip.com/asp/hls/main/0303000a/3/default/一串字符/main.m3u8?maxbr=2000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bulk Modify SQL Server Database Disk File Permissions</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-modify-sqlserver-database-disk-permissions/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:06:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-modify-sqlserver-database-disk-permissions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The company adjusted its security policies. Ultimately, ‘Mechanical Mini’ was relocated back home as a backup server, along with a full system reinstallation. Ubuntu switched to Windows Server; due to an irregular activation method – used at home – it seemed like it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be activated, and that was fine. An unconventional activation triggered Microsoft’s detection (running normally for half a month), the server would automatically shut down after running for one hour. After reviewing the system logs, it was discovered that this was due to using a pirated version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t much else to do, so the system was reinstalled again, and SQL Server also needed to be reinstalled – it&amp;rsquo;s always a bit of a pain each time. File permission control is very strict, making it impossible to attach the database normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;error-message&#34;&gt;Error Message
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the system reinstallation, &lt;code&gt;SqlServer&lt;/code&gt; may encounter error 5120, an operating system access denied error, when attaching a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;processing-script&#34;&gt;Processing Script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referencing the previous link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-and-legacy-permissions/&#34; &gt;Batch Update Local Git Repository&lt;/a&gt;, it’s that familiar script all over again – modified to, we iterate through folders while modifying file permissions. Currently used with full editing permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most tutorials online have you manually modify files. They only need to change a few files each time? I always have to process batches of files; doing everything manually is going to drive me crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;$currentUserName = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$rootDirectory = &amp;quot;D:\data\2013_RujiaInfo&amp;quot;

Get-ChildItem -Path $rootDirectory -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    $itemPath = $_.FullName

    if ($_ -is [System.IO.DirectoryInfo]) {
        $icaclsResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;Changed the owner of folder $itemPath to $currentUserName&amp;quot;
            # Grant current user write permissions
            Invoke-Expression &amp;quot;icacls `&amp;quot;$itemPath`&amp;quot; /grant `&amp;quot;$($currentUserName):(OI)(CI)F`&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
            Write-Host &amp;quot;Granted $currentUserName editing permissions for the folder&amp;quot;
        } else {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;Unable to change the owner of folder $itemPath. Error message: $icaclsResult&amp;quot;
        }
    } else {
        $takeownResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            # Grant current user write permissions
            Invoke-Expression &amp;quot;icacls `&amp;quot;$itemPath`&amp;quot; /grant `&amp;quot;$($currentUserName):(F)`&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
            Write-Host &amp;quot;Granted $currentUserName editing permissions for the file&amp;quot;

        <title>Linux System Benchmark Test</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-system-benchmark-test/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 10:56:23 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-system-benchmark-test/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Windows platform has RuMaster (Entertainment Master), which isn&amp;rsquo;t known for highly accurate data, but it’s still useful as a reference. Of course, there are other professional benchmarking software options available. When it comes to Linux systems, there haven’t seemed to be any particularly suitable benchmarking software found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sysbench is a versatile benchmark testing tool that can be used to test CPU, memory, file I/O, thread performance, and more. You can use Sysbench to execute various performance testing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently have three machines available for testing: the Mechanical Artist mini laptop, a local small host machine, an Alibaba Cloud Dev development cloud server, and a Huawei Cloud Dev server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-sysbench&#34;&gt;Installing Sysbench
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On most Linux distributions, you can use the package manager to install Sysbench. For example, on CentOS 8, you can use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo dnf install sysbench
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sysbench-usage-examples&#34;&gt;Sysbench Usage Examples
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing CPU performance: &lt;code&gt;sysbench --test=cpu run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing memory read performance: &lt;code&gt;sysbench --test=memory run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing file I/O performance:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sysbench --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw prepare
sysbench --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw run
sysbench --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw cleanup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing multi-threaded performance: &lt;code&gt;sysbench --test=threads --num-threads=4 run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing MySQL database performance (requires adjusting the maximum connection number):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=yourusername --mysql-password=yourpassword --oltp-table-size=1000000 prepare
sysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=yourusername --mysql-password=yourpassword --max-time=60 --oltp-read-only=off --oltp-test-mode=complex --max-requests=0 run
sysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=yourusername --mysql-password=yourpassword cleanup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt; is a good thing or not, the table above could not be arranged according to the previously mastered &lt;code&gt;Markdown&lt;/code&gt;, and it was not made into a table to display, which would result in a very poor effect. Customizing the theme limited the maximum page width, and a series of page configurations were adjusted accordingly, changing the width to percentage limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple method is to use tools like TablesGenerator to generate HTML tables (content complexity is not suitable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or write it using Google Docs online and then download and save it as an HTML document, directly copy it into the blog (simple and direct, ultimately adopted).
Ensure that the config configuration is enabled with unsafe configuration items, and independently configure the page width.
In Hugo, you can set the width of a page individually. This can be achieved by adding a custom parameter in the page&amp;rsquo;s Front Matter.  Here’s an example:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your Markdown page&amp;rsquo;s Front Matter section (usually at the beginning of the file), add a custom parameter such as &lt;code&gt;custom_width&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;---
title: &amp;quot;My Page&amp;quot;
date: 2024-01-09
custom_width: &amp;quot;800px&amp;quot;  # Set width to 800 pixels
---

Content...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your Hugo theme, find or create the corresponding single page template file (e.g., &lt;code&gt;layouts/_default/single.html&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the single page template, check if there is a &lt;code&gt;custom_width&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the Front Matter and apply it to the appropriate HTML elements, such as &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34;&gt;{{ define &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; }}
  &amp;lt;div style=&amp;quot;max-width: {{ with .Params.custom_width }}{{ . }}{{ else }}100%{{ end }}; margin: 0 auto;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    {{ .Content }}
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we used inline styles (the &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; attribute) to set the &lt;code&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt; property for the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; element when no &lt;code&gt;custom_width&lt;/code&gt; parameter is specified, defaulting the width to 100%. &lt;code&gt;margin: 0 auto;&lt;/code&gt; centers the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that in actual applications, you may need to adjust this example based on your theme structure and CSS styling details. Ensure that when adjusting styles, you maintain consistency and readability with the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the slight difference in the enabled theme, the site&amp;rsquo;s custom &lt;code&gt;CSS&lt;/code&gt; configuration was finally adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Git Disable HTTP Repository</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-disable-http-repositories/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 21:22:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-disable-http-repositories/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Updated habit software version, unsure which Git version to start from, prohibiting fetching code from &lt;code&gt;Http&lt;/code&gt; repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;fatal: Unencrypted HTTP is not supported for GitLab. Ensure the repository remote URL is using HTTPS
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-introduction&#34;&gt;Background Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environment: Windows platform, I’ve always used Tiny Turtle to operate Git, and key configuration was also handled through it. I previously created a script to batch update local repositories.
Previous article link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-and-legacy-permissions/&#34; &gt;Batch Update Local Git Repository&lt;/a&gt;
Today when I went home to execute the code update, the previous error occurred, and the repository could no longer be updated normally. I was planning to use &lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt;’s configuration to continue using the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; protocol to update the repository, but I searched everywhere without finding the corresponding configuration item.
The simplest solution is of course to switch to the &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; protocol to update the repository, as the &lt;code&gt;gitlab&lt;/code&gt; configured by the company will not provide the &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; protocol in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy-issues&#34;&gt;Legacy Issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing the batch update local repository script previously, we initially planned to use &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; to pull the repository and didn&amp;rsquo;t investigate thoroughly. The &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; configuration information configured via Small Turtle was not synchronized to the config file, resulting in a &amp;ldquo;permission denied&amp;rdquo; error when executing with the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git pull # prompts for permission issues and cannot update the repository normally
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking the key configuration using the command was correct: &lt;code&gt;ssh -T git@gitlab.yintech.net&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can successfully pull code using Small Turtle (TortoiseGit), but receive a &amp;ldquo;key not recognized&amp;rdquo; error when using the &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; command from the command line, this may be because Small Turtle uses PuTTY&amp;rsquo;s SSH key while the command line uses OpenSSH&amp;rsquo;s SSH key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key configuration in Small Turtle does not read key file information from the system &lt;code&gt;.ssh&lt;/code&gt; folder; instead, it configures the path to the key file separately through the interface when configuring the repository. There’s a useful trick: configuring the first pulled repository with its key allows other repositories to reuse that same key file. PuTTY loads the key and doesn&amp;rsquo;t immediately exit but starts a proxy service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adjusting the global configuration to not use the system default &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; configuration, Git Bash will use TortoisePlink for SSH operations. This configuration is suitable for situations where you are using TortoiseGit with the built-in PuTTY tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git config --global core.sshCommand &amp;quot;&#39;C:/Program Files/TortoiseGit/bin/TortoisePlink.exe&#39; -batch -ssh&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please modify the execution file path in the above configuration to match your Small Turtle installation path. Since the full path is configured, no need to add it to the system environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AI Programming and Task Decomposition</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-programming-and-task-decomposition/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 08:44:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-programming-and-task-decomposition/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I added a copy function to the site, which took me half a day of tinkering. Ultimately, the rendering effect wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite satisfactory, and as a somewhat mediocre frontend developer, I didn’t plan on improving it – if it worked, it was good enough. This year, I used &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; to develop a mini-program, which has also made me more familiar with frontend development. I refactored it (the &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; redesigned it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realization: Breaking down tasks really helps; many small tasks are quite natural for the &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; to develop. For the closed mini-program, 75% of the code was provided by &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, broken down into multiple tasks delivered, and manually assembled the project code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;previous-context&#34;&gt;Previous Context
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.github.io/post/2022/001/%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%BA%E5%BE%88%E7%AE%80%E5%8D%95%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%8B%E6%83%85%E5%A2%9E%E5%8A%A0%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E5%A4%8D%E5%88%B6%E6%8C%89%E9%92%AE/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Making simple things easier: Adding a code copy button&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;promot&lt;/strong&gt;: Design CSS and JavaScript code to locate webpage elements with the class &amp;ldquo;highlight&amp;rdquo;, and within their container, add a copy button to enable copying of the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first draft of the code was immediately problematic; I generated a revised version that is largely functional, but the copied content is incorrect, containing redundant text. Further guidance led to optimization, specifying core color design and effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having learned your specific requirements for button size and color, we redesigned the button styles to accommodate these demands.  Here’s the adjusted CSS style sheet, incorporating your provided color scheme and optimizing the button size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-css&#34;&gt;.copy-btn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 2px; /* Adjust position */
  right: 2px;
  padding: 3px 6px; /* Reduce size */
  font-size: 12px; /* Decrease font size */
  background-color: #8FD1E1; /* Button background color */
  color: #272822; /* Text color */
  border: 1px solid #272822; /* Border color */
  border-radius: 3px; /* Rounded corners */
  cursor: pointer;
  opacity: 0.7; /* Default semi-transparent */
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease, background-color 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition effect */
}

.copy-btn:hover {
  opacity: 1; /* Unhide on hover */
  background-color: #A3D4E5; /* Background color on hover */
}

.highlight {
  position: relative;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this style sheet, I reduced the button&amp;rsquo;s size and font size to create a more refined look. The button’s default state is semi-transparent, becoming fully opaque when hovered over, with a slightly brighter background color for visual feedback. This design meets your color requirements while maintaining modern and user-friendly characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simpler &lt;code&gt;JavaScript&lt;/code&gt; implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;document.addEventListener(&#39;DOMContentLoaded&#39;, function() {
  // Find all .highlight elements
  const highlights = document.querySelectorAll(&#39;.highlight&#39;);

  highlights.forEach(function(highlight) {
    // Create copy button
    const copyBtn = document.createElement(&#39;button&#39;);
    copyBtn.textContent = &#39;Copy&#39;;
    copyBtn.classList.add(&#39;copy-btn&#39;);

    // Add the button to each .highlight element
    highlight.appendChild(copyBtn);

    // Add click event listener
    copyBtn.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function() {
      // Assume the first &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; element within .highlight contains the code to copy
      const code = highlight.querySelector(&#39;code&#39;) ? highlight.querySelector(&#39;code&#39;).textContent : &#39;&#39;;

      navigator.clipboard.writeText(code).then(() =&amp;gt; {
        // Display success message
        copyBtn.textContent = &#39;Copied!&#39;;
        setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; {
          copyBtn.textContent = &#39;Copy&#39;;
        }, 2000);
      }).catch(err =&amp;gt; {
        console.error(&#39;Copy failed: &#39;, err);
      });
    });
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I had hoped to see a copy button added in the top-right corner of the code area, due to my lack of familiarity with frontend development, I was unable to accurately describe the functionality based on keywords and spent several rounds iterating with &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; without achieving the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen what impact &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; will have on software development as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Oriental Zhentan Short Essay Incident: A Collision of Culture and Commerce</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/dongfang-zhenxuan-essay-controversy-culture-vs-commerce/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 18:57:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/dongfang-zhenxuan-essay-controversy-culture-vs-commerce/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Zen Selection short essay incident was a online uproar triggered by Oriental Zen Selection’s official account denying that anchor Dong Yufei was the author of all the short essays. The truth is now unrecoverable, and the company&amp;rsquo;s power struggles have pushed this matter into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish’s seven-second memory will be handed over to &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; for writing, having experimented with &lt;code&gt;Bing AI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT Plus&lt;/code&gt;. The former provided more complete information, while the search engine still obtained more data, but the output blog content was not as complete and had a rigid format; the latter generated content based on keywords, which wasn’t as complete but could obtain full blog content. If given the URLs of reference materials, it could optimize the generated article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dongyu He incident, involving a short essay by Oriental Select, is a dispute centered around copyright and creative ownership. Beginning on December 5, 2023, it involved a series of interactions between anchor Dong Yuhe and Oriental Select. This storm not only revealed the complexities of commercial operations but also sparked profound reflections on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-5-2023-event-origin&#34;&gt;December 5, 2023: Event Origin
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongyu Hui, a host from Oriental Zhentan, quickly went viral after reciting “short essays” in a pre-release video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Zhentan stated in the video comments that most of these short essays were created by the copywriting team and not entirely from Dongyu Hui’s own hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-13-2023-dong-yufeis-response&#34;&gt;December 13, 2023: Dong Yufei’s Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Yufei published a lengthy article opposing the defamation of anyone under the guise of “fan circles,” stating her position on the matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-14-2023-management-response&#34;&gt;December 14, 2023: Management Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Xuhe (CEO of Oriental Zhensheng) released an apology video, admitting to management loopholes within the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yu Minhong (Chairman of Oriental Zhensheng) also responded to the incident, expressing apologies to Dong Yuhui.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-16-2023-major-decisions&#34;&gt;December 16, 2023: Major Decisions
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Zhentan officially removed Sun Dongxu from the CEO position, with Yu Minhong assuming the role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the same day, Yu Minhong published an apology letter, stating that he would unblock users who had been banned from live streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-18-2023-dong-yufeis-new-role&#34;&gt;December 18, 2023: Dong Yufei’s New Role
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Oriental Education &amp;amp; Technology Group appoints Dong Yufei as Chairman and Cultural Assistant of New Oriental Education &amp;amp; Technology Group, concurrently serving as Vice President of New Oriental Culture &amp;amp; Tourism Group.
-俞敏洪 (Yu Minhong) revealed that he will establish a studio with Dong Yufei to open new live broadcast accounts and live rooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-and-reflection&#34;&gt;Conclusion and Reflection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This storm was not only a dispute over copyright and creative ownership, but also deeply reflected the collision between culture and commerce. In today’s digital and fragmented era, the ownership of content copyrights has become a topic worthy of deep consideration. The Oriental Sanshifen Incident, not only a media storm, but also a profound reflection on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As observers, how should we view this collision between culture and commerce? While pursuing commercial interests, how can we protect and respect the creative labor of creators? These questions are worth deep consideration for each of us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games of the &amp;ldquo;pay-to-win&amp;rdquo; type, here we will not discuss this; within the gaming community, this is collectively referred to as “Renminbi Warriors” – requiring an affluent wallet rather than understanding game settings. Their enjoyment lies in the entourage of smaller players surrounding them and the thrill of “raid.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive games with a large audience, such as: League of Legends, DOTA, Honor of Kings, PUBG, these types of games have complete worldviews and their game competitions have entered a benign cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology is indeed a key field in game design, and social psychology is particularly important. Understanding people’s behavior, needs, and motivations can help design more engaging gaming experiences. Regarding the relationship between “showing off” and social psychology, we can look at it from the following angles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Identity:&lt;/strong&gt; People often seek to establish a sense of identity within social groups. In games, if designs allow players to feel they are outstanding in some way, attracting the attention of other players, this may increase their social identity. This could manifest as boasting skills or showcasing earned rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games have adopted social competition elements, encouraging players to showcase their achievements on social networks. This can be achieved through leaderboards, achievement systems, or multiplayer battles. Such designs stimulate competitive psychology between players and may lead some players to perform more impressively to gain social recognition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Expression:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games allow players to express themselves through customizing characters, virtual items, etc. This self-expression is not just for showing off; it can also be a way of expressing personality and social communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teamwork:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games emphasize teamwork, achieving game goals through social interaction. In such situations, boasting behavior may not be encouraged but rather emphasizes collaboration and mutual support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Reward Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design can adopt psychological reward systems to stimulate positive social behaviors in players. For example, rewarding or granting privileges to players to encourage them to actively participate in social interactions.
Overall, social psychology in game design can be used to shape player interaction and social experiences. Boasting behavior may exist in some situations, but game designers typically strive to balance this behavior to ensure that the gaming experience is positive and interesting for all players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about where I was writing, without a complete outline, it’s a bit chaotic.
The author often plays League of Legends, which is a memory of our generation. Most parents don&amp;rsquo;t like their children playing games because they haven&amp;rsquo;t deeply understood or experienced this type of game; of course, it has to do with the game settings. Each game is a new beginning, and for many children, when they play, they don’t bring much thought into it, belonging to self-exploration gameplay. Under this mode, the outcome of the game depends more on the child&amp;rsquo;s inherent gaming talent. Based on my actual experience, a large part of the players belong to this type, for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost is not money, but time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s also entertainment mode within the game, designed to cater to recreational players. League of Legends, this competitive game, for me, was more about realizing a “Three Kingdoms dream.” Starting off, you have nothing in your pockets, relying on your own understanding, farming, spending money, controlling vision, setting traps and ambushes for the opponent – it’s largely about thinking your way through the game. Without exceptional gaming talent, you can still find immense enjoyment. The feeling of commanding the overall situation, the joy of turning a losing game around. And there are also many viewers who often mention “casual players” – they no longer play the game but still watch the matches during major world events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s worth mentioning “game time.” This isn&amp;rsquo;t referring to the duration of a single match, but rather the amount of time you spend in the game – on weekends in the afternoons, or evenings between 7 pm and 10 pm after work. You’ll find that you can usually communicate normally with your teammates, and your signals are understood and responded to. If you switch to other times, such as playing through the night, you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to encounter “gaming addicts,” favorable situations where nothing happens, and in unfavorable situations, they’ll complain about you to your family – you can almost feel their resentment through the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As someone who works in the IT industry and plays a lot of games, I’ve tried various types, always preferring to think my way through the game rather than relying on reaction speed or talent. Compared to professionals or younger players, my reactions are slower, and I&amp;rsquo;m accustomed to coordinating with teammates and taking command of the team’s strategy. When I first started playing, it was during my student years, guided by older brothers from an YY guild.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, regarding the current game environment, it feels quite agitated and lacks the purity of before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After graduating, playing high-level segment games was really exhausting. The entire game required intense focus, thinking about the opponent&amp;rsquo;s plans, and how to counter their setups. It’s that kind of experience where you don’t want to continue after finishing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s be honest, if you’re considered a very good player, without professional competition, it wouldn’t have much impact on your life trajectory. While it can serve as a social tool, it&amp;rsquo;s not something you can make a living from or establish yourself in society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-player games and online games are two different types of games that differ significantly in their gameplay, experience, and technology. Here are some key aspects to understand the differences between single-player and online games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connection Method:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games (Offline/Single-player):&lt;/strong&gt; These games are played on a local device alone, without requiring an internet connection. Players can enjoy the game experience even without network connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games (Online/Multiplayer):&lt;/strong&gt; This type of game typically requires an internet connection because players need to interact with other players in real time. Online games can be cooperative or competitive, involving online social interaction and esports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player Interaction:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players primarily interact with artificial intelligence, pre-set tasks, or opposing elements within the game. The gaming experience is generally more personalized, influenced by the in-game design and storyline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players can interact with other real players from around the world. This may include collaborating on missions, competing against each other, or participating in esports competitions, as well as social elements like chat, guild systems, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Design and Content:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design focuses more on providing a complete, independent storyline and gaming experience. The game content is typically pre-designed, and players explore, solve puzzles, or fight within the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design needs to consider real-time interaction and player competition or collaboration. The game content may be more dynamic, including regular updates, online events, and social interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Generally run offline, with relatively low requirements for device performance and internet connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Require a strong internet connection and high demands on server and network performance to ensure smooth real-time interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Models:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Typically use one-time purchase or download business models, where players buy the game to play it fully on their local devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; May employ various business models such as free-to-play, advertising, item purchases, or subscriptions to maintain server operations and continuously update game content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these differences helps players clarify their preferences when choosing games and allows game designers to better meet player expectations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Cloud Servers and Script Kiddies</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cloud-servers-and-script-kids/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 15:08:53 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cloud-servers-and-script-kids/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Mining&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural Network&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Alibaba Cloud server was recently purchased during the Double Eleven event: an economy version with a price of 99 per year and low configuration, which is used as a jumpboard to proxy home services, it’s also a decent option. The activity lasts until 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, a Shanghai region server was selected to minimize latency when proxying home machines. Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 were installed, with the server version being deployed later.  Suddenly, a &amp;ldquo;access denied&amp;rdquo; message appeared, initially assuming it was due to a server update that would resolve itself. After five minutes, attempting to connect again still resulted in denial of login.  Searching for related error messages indicated that someone was attempting to log in, and excessive incorrect password attempts were preventing access.
I had previously encountered security attack scripts, so I immediately suspected a brute-force login attempt by malicious actors. The firewall settings were simplified, without enabling whitelisting, exposing ports 3389 for two machines publicly, much like bait in a fish pond.  Once identified as being targeted by script kiddies, the next steps were straightforward: setting up a firewall whitelist to allow only the company’s and home network IP addresses to access the proxy service.
&lt;code&gt;frps&lt;/code&gt; proxy server previously had no logging configuration, but after enabling logging, it was quite amusing – all sorts of domestic and international IP addresses were attempting to log into the home server. Fortunately, there was one server version running, which made me realize that if the Windows 11 machine hadn’t been targeted, it would have eventually been compromised due to the relatively simple password settings.&lt;/p&gt;

## Epilogue
Developing a self-hosted server requires setting up a whitelist for public Windows access, and on Linux systems, it’s recommended to disable password logins and enable key file login.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>- Batch update local Git repositories and resolve legacy permission issues.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-and-legacy-permissions/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 14:16:22 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-and-legacy-permissions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The projects within the team have dependencies on each other, and due to historical reasons, submodules haven’t been used to manage these project dependencies. Daily development requires manually updating the repository code one by one, otherwise various strange issues may arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to online resources, the structure is generally similar. A local manual repository directory (&lt;strong&gt;git_list.txt&lt;/strong&gt;) is maintained, and a script iterates through the directories to perform an update in one go. Before starting each project, this script needs to be executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;linux&#34;&gt;linux
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;create new file: batch_pull.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;#!/bin/bash

echo &amp;quot;============ Updating Repository ===================&amp;quot;

# Check if git_list.txt exists
if [ ! -f &amp;quot;git_list.txt&amp;quot; ]; then
  echo &amp;quot;git_list.txt file does not exist! Please create and add the Git repository URLs to pull.&amp;quot;
  exit 1
else
  echo &amp;quot;============ Detected Git Repository List File ===================&amp;quot;
fi

# Read each URL from git_list.txt and execute the pull operation
while read -r url; do
  if [ -d &amp;quot;$url&amp;quot; ]; then
    cd &amp;quot;$url&amp;quot; || continue
    git pull
    cd ..
    echo &amp;quot;Pull $url completed!&amp;quot;
    echo &amp;quot;========================================&amp;quot;
  else
    echo &amp;quot;Directory $url does not exist, skipping pull.&amp;quot;
  fi
done &amp;lt; &amp;quot;git_list.txt&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;windows&#34;&gt;Windows
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a new file: batch_pull.bat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-batch&#34;&gt;@echo off
chcp 65001 &amp;gt; nul
rem Enter the directory of the script
cd /d &amp;quot;%~dp0&amp;quot;

rem Check if git_list.txt exists
if not exist &amp;quot;git_list.txt&amp;quot; (
  echo git_list.txt file does not exist! Please create and add the Git repository URLs you want to pull.
  exit /b 1
) else (
  echo ============ Detected Git repository list file =========
)

rem Read each URL from git_list.txt and execute the pull operation
for /f %%i in (git_list.txt) do (
  if exist &amp;quot;%%i&amp;quot; (
    pushd &amp;quot;%%i&amp;quot;
    git pull
    popd
    echo Pull %%i completed!
    echo ========================================
  ) else (
    echo Directory %%i does not exist, skipping pull.
  )
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;historical-issues&#34;&gt;Historical Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also addressed the &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; folder permission files encountered after reinstalling the system: &lt;strong&gt;Fatal error &amp;ldquo;unsafe repository (&amp;rsquo;/home/repon&amp;rsquo; is owned by someone else)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.
Most suggested solutions online originate from &lt;code&gt;stack overflow&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add trust to the repository directory: &lt;code&gt;git config --global --add safe.directory /home/repon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manually modify the configuration file &lt;code&gt;.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt;, specifying the directory to add trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;[safe]
    directory = /home/repon
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using this method, repository updates are normal, but there are many warning messages displayed in the console every time &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; is executed, indicating owner errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;desktop-system-reinstallation&#34;&gt;Desktop System Reinstallation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machines developed for a long time without system reinstallation, the system partition contained an explosion of garbage files, so I took some time to reinstall the system and encountered this permission issue again. Previous scripts would not run because the permissions were incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the new approach, directly add &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, so that &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; automatically trusts all directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git config --global --add safe.directory &amp;quot;*&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is suspected to be a user permission problem, or whether everyone has not adapted to the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; platform. There are similar &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt; commands.  You can modify folder ownership. Of course, if your directories are few, manually modifying ownership also works. However, this work computer has added domain information. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s an abnormal domain deployed by the company or whether there is an anomaly in the local system settings. The user list cannot find the user used for login, and finally processed through command-line operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With administrator permissions, execute the &lt;code&gt;powershell&lt;/code&gt; script &lt;code&gt;change_ower.ps1&lt;/code&gt;, remember to adjust the script file encoding to &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt; so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t display garbled characters in Chinese operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-powershell&#34;&gt;# Get the current user&#39;s username
$currentUserName = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name

# Set PowerShell&#39;s character encoding to UTF-8
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8

# The root directory path to change ownership
$rootDirectory = &amp;quot;G:\workspace&amp;quot;  # Replace with the actual directory path

# Recursively iterate through directories and change file and folder owners
Get-ChildItem -Path $rootDirectory -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    $itemPath = $_.FullName

    # Check if it&#39;s a file or a folder
    if ($_ -is [System.IO.DirectoryInfo]) {
        # If it&#39;s a folder, use icacls to change the owner permission
        $icaclsResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;Changed the owner of folder $itemPath to $currentUserName&amp;quot;
        } else {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;Unable to change the owner of folder $itemPath. Error information: $icaclsResult&amp;quot;
        }
    } else {
        # If it&#39;s a file, use icacls to change the owner permission
        $takeownResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            # Write-Host &amp;quot;Changed the owner of file $itemPath to $currentUserName&amp;quot;
        } else {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;Unable to change the owner of file $itemPath. Error information: $takeownResult&amp;quot;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpected situations still occurred, and the Chinese information output by the script was garbled. I tried setting the console character encoding and adjusting the script encoding, but the output was all garbled.  It is likely that my brain wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear at all. I tried enabling the beta feature in Control Panel - Region - Language Settings to globally enable Unicode encoding, and the script executed normally. Several development software programs could not work properly. Later, when reviewing materials, I remembered to adjust the script file encoding to &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The potholes in the mini-program development haven’t been filled, and we’ve just dug a new one with &lt;strong&gt;WPF&lt;/strong&gt;. Recently, the company has been experiencing some turbulence, and remote collaboration communication is invariably less efficient than desired. So, we&amp;rsquo;ve taken on the development of client interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wpf&#34;&gt;WPF

    &gt;WPF Personal Summary and Learning Recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;WPF&lt;/code&gt; interface design uses many concepts similar to web frontend design, striving to isolate UI design from business logic as much as possible, which is the desired division of labor in internet companies. This year I just finished tinkering with Mini Programs, and many concepts are common, making it relatively easy to get started. These are considered the “Dao” in modern UI design – mastering the basic framework concepts makes the path less prone to deviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For readers who have previous &lt;code&gt;WinForms&lt;/code&gt; development experience, it is recommended to read: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cnblogs.com/zh7791/p/11502696.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF Basic Summary (Learning Suggestions)&lt;/a&gt;. The content is not long and is suitable for experienced readers to plan their learning path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For beginners, it is recommended to read: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wpfsoft.com/introduction&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF Chinese Website&lt;/a&gt;, which introduces basic concepts, the development history, and the logical reasoning of underlying classes from scratch. This website happens to be quite lucky – the author just released it in August this year, timed perfectly with my content to attract readers to purchase courses. If I waited any later, I’d probably have no chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most authoritative learning materials, of course, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s official resources are preferred, but they can be a bit dry, and new learners need patience.
Classic electronic books also exist, but they are not recommended; there isn&amp;rsquo;t much time to sit down and read them in daily work, so it’s more suitable to practice with projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;c-and-net-release-history&#34;&gt;C# and .NET Release History
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding previous learning languages, there have been a number of new features released in recent years, and the versioning of syntax has been iterating annually.

        <title>The Opening of Financial Anti-Corruption</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain-rise/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 14:53:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain-rise/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: will intensify anti-corruption efforts in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector, and thoroughly rectify “the four prevailing tendencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;communist-party-of-china-central-politburo&#34;&gt;Communist Party of China Central Politburo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on September 27, reviewing the Comprehensive Report on the First Round Supervision of the First Session of the Twentieth Party Congress. Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, chaired the meeting. The meeting emphasized that the supervision and oversight work should be used as an opportunity to further strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party in all aspects, urging supervised party organizations to raise their political stance, conscientiously fulfill the responsibilities and missions assigned by the Central Committee, continuously enhance the core functions and competitiveness of state-owned enterprises, consolidate the important material and political foundations of socialism with Chinese characteristics, intensify financial institutions&amp;rsquo; service to the real economy and national strategies, and promote high-quality development. It was stressed to coordinate development and security, firmly establish bottom-line and limit thinking, adopt effective measures to prevent and mitigate major risks, and safeguard the safety line.  It was also necessary to advance comprehensive Party self-discipline to greater depths, consolidate the responsibility of the secretary of the党委 (party committee) as the first person, strengthen the responsibilities of leadership committees members “dual duties in one position,” and enhance the supervision responsibilities of disciplinary and supervisory organizations, highlight strengthening supervision of all levels’ “one leader”, intensify anti-corruption efforts in state-owned enterprises and financial sectors, deeply rectify “four prevailing styles,” deepen reform, improve systems, promote source governance, and facilitate treatment of problems comprehensively. (Xinhua)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating Major Financial Risks! Liu Liange, former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Merchants Bank, has been expelled from the Communist Party.
According to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision, with the approval of the Communist Party of China, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision initiated an investigation into Liu Liange’s serious violation of disciplinary and illegal acts as the former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon investigation, Liu Liange lost his ideological conviction, betrayed his original mission, was firm and resolute in implementing the decisions and plans of the Communist Party Central Committee, failed to guard against financial risk prevention responsibilities, recklessly intervened in loan projects and issued loans illegally, causing major financial risks, was ineffective in fulfilling his role as the main body of comprehensive self-discipline of the Party, seriously damaged the political ecology of his unit, privately brought prohibited books into the country, plotted against organizational scrutiny; ignored the spirit of the Eight Rules, accepted gifts and valuables illegally, visited private venues, and received skiing and tourism arrangements; failed to report personal matters in accordance with regulations, did not truthfully explain when questioned by the organization, showed favoritism in appointing and promoting personnel; violated regulations regarding commercial operations; illegally interfered with capital lending, secretly retained confidential materials; was morally corrupt, had an improper family style, failed to properly manage his relatives and educate them; lacked a bottom line of discipline and law, abused power, “ate from finance,” used his position for the benefit of others in loan financing, project cooperation, and illegally accepted huge amounts of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu Liange seriously violated the Party’s political conduct, organizational conduct, integrity conduct, work conduct, and lifestyle conduct, constituted serious disciplinary violations and was suspected of criminal offenses related to illegal loan issuance and fraud, and did not curb or restrain himself after the 18th Party Congress, had a severe and adverse impact, warranted serious handling. In accordance with relevant provisions of the &lt;em&gt;Disciplinary Punishment Code of the Communist Party of China&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Law of the People’s Republic of China on Supervision&lt;/em&gt;, and after deliberation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision Committee and approval by the Communist Party of China, it was decided to expel Liu Liange from the Communist Party with a dismissal sanction; cancel his benefits in accordance with regulations; terminate his representation in the Nineteenth National Congress; recover illegally obtained income; transfer his suspected criminal issues to the Public Prosecutor’s Office for investigation and prosecution, and related property to be transferred to the Public Prosecutor’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li Xiaopeng, former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Everbright Bank, has been expelled from the Communist Party and public office due to serious violations and illegal acts (CCTV News).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision reported: According to a report from the Guiyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Zhi Ming, former Party Secretary and Chairman of Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank, was suspected of serious violation of discipline and law and is currently under investigation by the Guiyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-an-eight-year-hiatus-huijin-boosts-holdings-in-four-major-banks&#34;&gt;After an Eight-Year Hiatus, Huijin Boosts Holdings in Four Major Banks
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 11th, Industrial Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and Construction Bank – the four major state-owned commercial banks – respectively announced that Huijin Company had increased its holdings, totaling 276.1 million shares, 372.7 million shares, 248.9 million shares, and 183.8 million shares, respectively. Huijin Company plans to continue increasing its holdings in the four major banks on the secondary market over the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Revenue Generation Business Model: Raffle/Sweepstakes</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/traffic-monetization-business-model-raffle/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 07:04:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/traffic-monetization-business-model-raffle/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Live streamers sending iPhones? Mini-program ranking rewards? Various live streaming platform gift giveaways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three seemingly unrelated items are, in essence, different monetization models for free traffic – a bit like a financial game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;platform-lottery-for-gifts&#34;&gt;Platform Lottery for Gifts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typical scenarios, users reset their acquisition of platform currency and purchase gifts to send to the host, &amp;ldquo;Xin Yi&amp;rdquo; (Hearty), with each platform having another gameplay mechanic. After users acquire platform currency, they no longer directly send gifts but instead spend a certain amount of currency to participate in lottery activities, obtaining limited high-value gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the online lottery is simply understood as the platform opening a casino. With enough participants, it’s guaranteed not to lose money. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;屌丝&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; (literally &amp;ldquo;loser,&amp;rdquo; often used colloquially to describe lower-income individuals) users, fueled by a desire to try their luck and win big, hoping to hit a jackpot and then send gifts – gaining face and acting as a “big brother”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;live-stream-gifts-physical-items&#34;&gt;Live Stream Gifts (Physical Items)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lottery mentioned previously targets users’ own writing. Each month, the hosts have water flow tasks and popularity tasks. The gameplay of opening gift giveaways allows fans to send specific gifts or gifts of a specified amount, giving them the opportunity to participate in the lottery. The prizes could be high-end phones or cash red envelopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For popular hosts, this activity is very profitable, essentially equivalent to temporary zero-cost purchases. If enough people participate, the host also makes money. This tests the host’s operational capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s another gameplay where the rewards are very high (cash value), and many outdoor anchors operate in this way, effectively turning it into an online gambling. Users only care about whether they can win, not the content of the live stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from show-type hosts, through PK mode, they induce fans to consume and recharge, and ordinary game anchors cannot drive players’ consumption sentiment. Playing games and watching live streams are both ways to pass the time and don&amp;rsquo;t want to incur additional expenses, especially &lt;strong&gt;competitive games&lt;/strong&gt;. The lottery method can cultivate users’ recharging habits, consumption habits, and occasionally even impulsive spending (sending a lot, hoping to win).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mini-program-ranking-rewards&#34;&gt;Mini Program Ranking Rewards
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design a mini program with some useless workflows or provide partial game-related auxiliary services. The above are all cover stories, designed to pass Tencent’s audit – the mini program’s gameplay incorporates a ranking mechanism. Users earn points by browsing promotional ads and completing tasks, and the backend sets rankings based on these points, with higher-ranked users receiving designated rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core Logic: Advertising Revenue &amp;gt; Operating Costs + Reward Expenses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mini program can also operate normally by providing reasonable services and earning revenue through appropriate advertising – this may not generate much income, but it’s a steady trickle and is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>ZeroTier VPN</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/zero-tier-remote-lan/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 04:58:03 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/zero-tier-remote-lan/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I recently got a &lt;code&gt;mini&lt;/code&gt; host for the office, thinking it would be convenient to configure an environment and have occasional access at home. I temporarily deployed internal network penetration using &lt;code&gt;frp&lt;/code&gt; – specifying port forwarding, which requires a public server with a connection quality dependent on its bandwidth. Instead, I experimented with a fresh &lt;code&gt;Zerotier&lt;/code&gt; virtual LAN, similar to a &lt;code&gt;VPN&lt;/code&gt;, where I created a virtual network card locally and all machines joined it into a single virtual network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-zerotier&#34;&gt;What is ZeroTier
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ZeroTier&lt;/code&gt; is a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) solution that allows users to create secure virtual networks between devices in different geographic locations. Through &lt;code&gt;ZeroTier&lt;/code&gt;, you can easily connect multiple computers, servers, and devices into a virtual, encrypted network – as if they were on the same local network. This helps developers and IT professionals securely share data and resources across different locations without complex network setups or VPN configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZeroTier Networks&lt;/strong&gt;: A ZeroTier network is a virtual, global LAN that allows different devices to connect together over the internet, as if they were on the same physical network. This network can contain multiple subnets, with all devices connected through ZeroTier technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planet Servers&lt;/strong&gt;: Planet servers are a key component of the ZeroTier network. They are global and responsible for maintaining and managing the entire ZeroTier network topology, routing information, and network status. The planet server acts as a central control center for the global network, without directly transferring data. User devices need to connect to at least one planet server to participate in the ZeroTier network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transit Servers&lt;/strong&gt;: Transit servers are auxiliary nodes within the ZeroTier network that help establish direct communication channels between devices. When devices cannot connect directly, they can use transit servers to transmit data. This helps improve network reachability and performance. Transit servers are typically located around the world, acting as data transmission hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, ZeroTier uses the assistance of planet servers and transit servers to enable devices to create virtual local networks globally, achieving secure and fast communication between devices. The planet server is responsible for global network management, while the transit server helps devices establish connections when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation--deployment&#34;&gt;Installation &amp;amp; Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the ZeroTier official website (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zerotier.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.zerotier.com/&lt;/a&gt;) to obtain installation files and documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install the ZeroTier One client according to your operating system. It supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and many other platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch the ZeroTier One client after installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register a ZeroTier account if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have one. You can create an account within the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in with your ZeroTier account and create a new network. This network will have a unique 16-character ID, which you need to remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join this network on your device. You can either enter the network ID in the client or use the QR code scanning feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devices installed and configured with the ZeroTier client will be added to the same virtual network. These devices can now communicate directly with each other as if they were on the same local area network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can manage network settings, add devices, and monitor network traffic in the ZeroTier control panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-and-deploying-moon&#34;&gt;Installing and Deploying Moon
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many domestic operators have banned &lt;code&gt;UDP&lt;/code&gt; tunneling, and the &lt;code&gt;frp&lt;/code&gt; service is stable. Due to using the &lt;code&gt;TCP&lt;/code&gt; protocol, deploying &lt;code&gt;Zerotier&lt;/code&gt; intermediate servers can achieve similar effects. The firewall needs to open &lt;code&gt;udp 9993&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;curl -s https://install.zerotier.com/ | sudo bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check installation success:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;zerotier-cli info
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the local network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;zerotier-cli join network-id
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;moon&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;cd /var/lib/zerotier-one &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo zerotier-idtool initmoon identity.public &amp;gt; moon.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit the configuration file, adjust the &lt;code&gt;stableEndpoints&lt;/code&gt; node, &amp;ldquo;server public IP/9993&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate a signature configuration, create the &lt;code&gt;moons.d&lt;/code&gt; folder, move the previous files to this folder, and restart the service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo zerotier-idtool genmoon moon.json
mkdir moons.d &amp;amp;&amp;amp; mv 000000eb444ec0d8.moon moons.d/
systemctl restart zerotier-one.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client nodes join the &lt;code&gt;moon&lt;/code&gt; server, taking the ID from the JSON configuration file&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;zerotier-cli.bat orbit ztaddr ztaddr
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;# Observe whether new moon nodes appear, with IDs and information matching the server configuration

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Windows platform, start the terminal with administrator privileges and use the &lt;code&gt;zerotier-cli.bat&lt;/code&gt; command-line interface. On the Linux platform, use the &lt;code&gt;zerotier-cli&lt;/code&gt; interface. The &lt;code&gt;listpeers&lt;/code&gt; subcommand displays connected nodes and shows all nodes when using &lt;code&gt;listpeers&lt;/code&gt;, indicating a successful join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uninstalling&#34;&gt;Uninstalling
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to uninstall on the &lt;code&gt;Windows&lt;/code&gt; platform is beyond the scope of this document, as it follows standard operating procedures – typically through the Control Panel. We will focus on the &lt;code&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/code&gt; instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the zerotier-one service using dpkg:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo dpkg -P zerotier-one
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete the zerotier-one directory, which stores the address information; deleting it will result in a new address upon reinstallation:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo rm -rf /var/lib/zerotier-one/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were originally all decommissioned, and when the servers arrived, there weren’t suitable services as proxy nodes. Alibaba was doing sales promotion, providing development trial servers with low configurations, priced affordably in 1999, and used them for two years. What was valued was the bandwidth provided by the servers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>VMware Virtual Machine Disk Space Optimization</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-machine-disk-space-optimization/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;When installing a development system with VMware virtual machines, it’s generally recommended to allocate extra disk space. Over time, the local disk space consumed by the VM will far exceed the actual size of its files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scenario-description&#34;&gt;Scenario Description
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;df -h&lt;/code&gt; command revealed that the current machine was using 60GB of disk space, and after deleting all snapshots and clone images, the local virtual machine still occupied significantly more than 60GB, further straining the already limited hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34;&gt;Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When installing the virtual machine, do not select &amp;ldquo;pre-allocate disk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The local hard drive where the virtual machine is stored must have sufficient free disk space greater than the currently used space of the virtual machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there isn&amp;rsquo;t enough space, consider temporarily moving the virtual machine to a portable hard drive, optimize the disk, and then migrate it back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official provides the &lt;code&gt;open-vm-tools&lt;/code&gt; package, which can be installed via yum or by installing the VMware-Tools image package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;commands&#34;&gt;Commands
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;vmware-toolbox-cmd disk shrink /
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After execution, the virtual machine will automatically shut down, and the VMware host program will perform disk compression. The execution time depends on the volume of the virtual machine and the speed of the disk access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect is quite good; the disk space occupied by the virtual machine is essentially equal to the disk information as shown in &lt;code&gt;df -h&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stable Diffusion – The Love, Hate, and Drama of Installing it from Scratch</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/stable-diffusion-zero-install-story/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 00:23:54 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/stable-diffusion-zero-install-story/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Domestic resources are basically all recommending &lt;strong&gt;Autumn Leaf&lt;/strong&gt;’s one-click deployment package, thinking that they are open-source projects based on &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;, so deployment wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be very complicated, let&amp;rsquo;s try to start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was messing around with AI-generated images and specifically changed my graphics card, a beginner version of the &lt;code&gt;3060 12g&lt;/code&gt;; the seven-year-old &lt;code&gt;960&lt;/code&gt; retired gloriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core &lt;code&gt;pytorch cuda&lt;/code&gt; installation, which I previously encountered issues with when writing Python game helper scripts (I had installed it locally before), still presented problems – the &lt;code&gt;cuda&lt;/code&gt; encryption consistently failed to activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-do&#34;&gt;To Do
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replan the article structure, first introduce PyTorch, version correspondence, and how to check versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to create a new virtual environment from scratch locally and deploy PyTorch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate the manuscript from scratch: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stable-diffusion-art.com/install-windows/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://stable-diffusion-art.com/install-windows/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize reference materials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps&#34;&gt;Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step-by-step installation tutorials in Chinese may not be readily available. When you search in English on &lt;code&gt;Google&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll find many similar tutorials starting from scratch. After a brief introduction, we need to install &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and then explain the need to install &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;. Then, you go ahead and download the repository – simply double-clicking the script does the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detailed usage and Q&amp;amp;A, consult the &lt;code&gt;issues&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t know why no one explains what this repository is for. Actually, the name itself isn&amp;rsquo;t difficult to understand – it’s a graphical control console that makes it easier to use. During installation, it downloads the official repository content and obtains the actual &lt;code&gt;SD&lt;/code&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository also provides an installation and startup script that automatically recognizes the current folder and whether there is a &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; virtual environment. If one exists, it defaults to using the Python in the current path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For beginner users, we recommend checking out: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stable-diffusion-art.com/install-windows/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://stable-diffusion-art.com/install-windows/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pytorch&#34;&gt;PyTorch
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I wanted to talk about today. Don&amp;rsquo;t just follow their steps and run the script directly. Python uses requirement files to install dependencies, which is a minor issue. The core thing is your GPU version and driver version, which need to match PyTorch. Many people have discussed this relationship online – you can find it by searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refer to: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40660408/article/details/129896700&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40660408/article/details/129896700&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a virtual environment is like creating an empty virtual environment, where you first execute the official script and install PyTorch within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;python -c &amp;quot;import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;python -c &amp;quot;import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available())&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above two scripts can check the CUDA version you need to install and also check if PyTorch has been installed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not recommended to do fancy operations here – just follow the logic on the official page and copy it over directly to install.  Directly using &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; to install PyTorch is likely to fail or won&amp;rsquo;t activate CUDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key point: Don’t use messy folder names, as this could cause PyTorch to not work correctly. I spent a lot of time installing and reinstalling, trying to upgrade to version 2.0 because the official documentation said it would be faster.  I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used it much before, and wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if Python versions had an impact. I also reviewed the official manual, which recommended using version 3.8. This created a small conflict since I’d previously used a one-click installation package that contained version 3.10. Finally, I started from scratch by creating a new folder, creating a virtual environment, and ensuring PyTorch was installed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I moved the newly installed virtual environment into the web UI folder.  At this point, running the script to install other dependencies didn’t cause any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After moving it, you need to execute: &lt;code&gt;python -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall pip&lt;/code&gt; to fix Pip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem a bit strange, but I spent quite a long time troubleshooting this because it couldn&amp;rsquo;t correctly recognize my PyTorch.  I realized that by installing it first, then installing other dependencies, I could eliminate all sources of interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;xformers&#34;&gt;Xformers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to enable this, which can accelerate image generation and reduce memory usage. However, a side effect is that &lt;strong&gt;generated images are relatively less stable&lt;/strong&gt; with the same set of parameters.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn’t recommend the one-click deployment package because it contained some settings that were customized by the author and differed from the official, out-of-the-box configuration. If you&amp;rsquo;re a beginner, you might not understand why those parameters are optimal; it’s generally best to start with the official version. As you use it more and more, take time to read the official documentation, and you’ll learn which parameters need adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gpu-selection&#34;&gt;GPU Selection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the cryptocurrency mining boom, GPU prices have become relatively less high; for entry-level players choosing between the &lt;code&gt;3060&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;3060ti&lt;/code&gt;, it’s generally recommended to opt for the 12G version of the 3060 due to its larger VRAM, as it can generate larger resolution images. Why do you need a higher resolution? Because you can increase the resolution during generation, which will result in clearer and more detailed images. If you only want to generate small images, then 8GB of VRAM is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the &lt;strong&gt;Super Resolution Upscaling&lt;/strong&gt; option, which enhances details and makes the image richer in detail, requiring more VRAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every six months, I originally planned to revisit and refine the installation steps, and explain more basic concepts. However, I discovered that most people using AI image generation are simply adjusting parameters based on images provided by experts, or re-rendering existing images with formatting changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had previously attempted a project using AI to generate UI materials for mini programs, but after struggling for half a day, the results were unsatisfactory compared to just pulling resource images directly from the official mini program documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Program optimization should not attempt to fight against hardware.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/program-optimization-dont-fight-hardware/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;one loop thread&lt;/code&gt;, the time taken has already been at the &lt;strong&gt;microsecond&lt;/strong&gt; level, switching servers resulted in a backlog of up to 60,000 packets, to almost none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In single-threaded loop processing data scenarios, the CPU performance depends on factors such as clock frequency, cache size, and instruction set architecture. Generally, CPUs with higher clock frequencies, larger caches, and more advanced instruction set architectures perform better in single-threaded data processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;single-threaded&#34;&gt;Single-Threaded
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance improvements aren&amp;rsquo;t always achieved by adding threads; it’s not necessary to overcomplicate things.  Refine the project workflow, identify time-consuming bottlenecks, and determine if a single thread can meet the requirements. Considering single-threaded approaches reduces complexity and minimizes potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s often a bit misguided to jump straight into suggesting threading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Working late into the night to release a new optimized version, local API removal for testing, speed was okay, tps: 42,000
Deployed to server, tps dropped significantly: 21,000, went home to try on a desktop, tps: 79,000, started suspecting that the internal service virtual machines might have some issues, initially suspected frequency-related problems, the difference between the home desktop and the server’s &lt;code&gt;CPU&lt;/code&gt; is the biggest, namely the frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, from the perspective of core count and clock frequency, the E5-2640 v3 should be more advantageous in single-threaded data processing compared to the E7-4807.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, considering cache size, the E7-4807 has a cache size of 12MB, while the E5-2640 v3 has a cache size of 20MB. Therefore, the E5-2640 v3 possesses larger cache space, which can improve data access speed and cache hit rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, regarding architecture, the E5-2640 v3 utilizes the more advanced Haswell architecture, while the E7-4807 employs the older Nehalem architecture. The Haswell architecture offers performance improvements compared to the Nehalem architecture, which may also influence the E5-2640 v3’s performance in single-threaded data processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, considering everything comprehensively, in scenarios involving single-threaded loop processing of data, the E5-2640 v3 should exhibit better performance than the E7-4807. However, specific performance differences will be influenced by various factors including data processing algorithms, memory bandwidth, system load, and so on, requiring a case-by-case analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/prompt-engineer/</link>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/prompt-engineer/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as we needed to learn the techniques of searching engines back then, we also need to learn some techniques for communicating with &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, providing reasonable and sufficient constraints, and efficiently obtaining the answers we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at it from a different angle, current &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; is like a very good student with excellent memory – it has the ability to memorize everything. What we need to do is learn how to communicate with &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; correctly, effectively, and precisely describe our needs to help &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; generate the expected results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##科普
The incredibly popular &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; – specifically &lt;code&gt;Generative Pre-Training&lt;/code&gt; – literally translates to generative pre-training. It’s a deep learning model that trains text generation based on internet-available data, used for tasks like question answering, text summarization generation, machine translation, classification, code generation, and conversational AI. Currently, there have been various versions of models such as GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4, each larger and more powerful than the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-it-really-have-intelligence&#34;&gt;Does it Really Have Intelligence?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarity is high, accuracy increases accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic, repetitive tasks, after specific training, no longer require human intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is a technology that utilizes existing data such as text, audio, and images to create new content. It can be used for various tasks including text generation, speech synthesis, image generation, and dialogue systems. The logical reasoning of Generative AI depends on its training data and model structure. Generally, Generative AI can follow grammar, logic, and common sense to a certain extent, but it may also produce errors, biases, or unrealistic content. Therefore, the output of Generative AI requires human judgment and verification; it should not be blindly trusted or used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt-engineer&#34;&gt;Prompt Engineer
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time flows only forward, and people need to learn to adapt to the current. You can think of &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; as not intelligent, lacking logic, and often producing unusable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you shift your perspective, the current &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; is like a child with excellent memory – it has the ability to memorize after reading something repeatedly, much like copying homework. What we need to do is learn how to communicate correctly, effectively, and with &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, precisely describing our needs to help &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; generate the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dialogue-patterns&#34;&gt;Dialogue Patterns
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, when GitHub Copilot was released, no one could have imagined that two years later, OpenAI would appear out of nowhere, allowing humans to recognize the capabilities of large language models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;strong&gt;comment-based programming&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;conversational programming&lt;/strong&gt;, the interaction logic is completely different. The dialogue pattern is friendly for novice users, and it’s necessary to mention NewBing providing follow-up prompts after each question. Microsoft is trying to guide users to obtain more content from the AI knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example Scenario
&lt;strong&gt;Scene:&lt;/strong&gt; A long high-speed train journey, coding is a good choice. With limited traffic, processing a few images, obtaining image materials, downloading software to process images is a bit extravagant, and network conditions don’t allow it.
&lt;strong&gt;Requirement:&lt;/strong&gt; There are a batch of picture materials with transparent background images used as navigation bars for small programs. The selected state is colored, and the unselected state is black and white. The materials are all in color, and they need to be preprocessed.
&lt;strong&gt;Prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; Write a python code snippet to read all pictures from a folder, convert the pictures into black and white, maintain the transparent background, save the pictures, optimize the image quality, reduce file size, and display it in the console, comparing the sizes before and after optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Import necessary libraries
import os
from PIL import Image

# Define a function to convert images to black and white, maintain transparency, save images, and return file sizes
def convert_and_save(image_file):
    # Open the image
    image = Image.open(image_file)
    # Get the image mode, if it&#39;s RGBA mode, indicating a transparent background
    mode = image.mode
    if mode == &amp;quot;RGBA&amp;quot;:
        # Create a white background image with the same size as the original image
        background = Image.new(&amp;quot;RGB&amp;quot;, image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        # Paste the original image onto the white background, ignoring transparent pixels
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
        # Convert the composite image to grayscale mode
        gray_image = background.convert(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
        # Convert the grayscale image back to RGBA mode to preserve transparency
        final_image = gray_image.convert(&amp;quot;RGBA&amp;quot;)
    else:
        # If it&#39;s not RGBA mode, directly convert the image to grayscale mode
        final_image = image.convert(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
    # Get the original image file name and extension
    file_name, file_ext = os.path.splitext(image_file)
    # Define the new image file name with _bw suffix for black and white
    new_file_name = file_name + &amp;quot;_bw&amp;quot; + file_ext
    # Save the new image and optimize quality, reduce file size
    final_image.save(new_file_name, optimize=True)
    # Get the original and new image file sizes and return
    old_size = os.path.getsize(image_file)
    new_size = os.path.getsize(new_file_name)
    return old_size, new_size

# Define a folder path to store all images
folder_path = &amp;quot;images&amp;quot;
# Iterate through all files in the folder
for file in os.listdir(folder_path):
    # Concatenate the full file path
    file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file)
    # Check if the file is an image file based on extension (can add or modify extensions as needed)
    if file_path.endswith((&amp;quot;.png&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.jpg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.jpeg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.gif&amp;quot;)):
        # Call the function to convert and save the image, and get the file size
        old_size, new_size = convert_and_save(file_path)
        # Display the comparison of file sizes before and after optimization in the console
        print(f&amp;quot;{file}: {old_size} bytes -&amp;gt; {new_size} bytes&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; quickly provided an answer, looked very beautiful, and worked well, experienced programmers would find that the code below was not very generic, and couldn’t be put into production:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No log files, all information is printed to the console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The task of image processing is suitable for a multi-threaded model
&lt;code&gt;NewBing&lt;/code&gt; appeared, based on the prompt, chose a question: &lt;strong&gt;What can be improved in this code?&lt;/strong&gt;
The answer given this time was far beyond expectations, and most programmers would think of optimization measures, &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; gave corresponding suggestions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;This code may still have some improvements, such as:

You can use the argparse library to allow users to specify the folder path and extension through command-line parameters instead of hardcoding them in the code.
You can use the logging library to record the running status of the program instead of printing it directly to the console.
You can use try-except statements to catch potential exceptions, such as file opening failure, image conversion failure, etc., and handle them

## Let&#39;s illustrate with an example

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import argparse
import logging
import multiprocessing

from PIL import Image


# Define a function to convert and save the image, maintaining transparent background and optimizing file size
def convert_and_save(image_file):

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f&amp;quot;Failed to open {image_file}: {e}&amp;quot;)
        return None, None
    # Get the image mode; if it&#39;s RGBA, it has a transparent background
    mode = image.mode
    if mode == &amp;quot;RGBA&amp;quot;:
        # Create a white background image with the same size
        background = Image.new(&amp;quot;RGB&amp;quot;, image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        # Paste the original image onto the white background, ignoring transparent pixels
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
        # Convert the combined image to grayscale mode
        gray_image = background.convert(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
        # Convert the grayscale image back to RGBA mode to preserve the transparent background
        final_image = gray_image.convert(&amp;quot;RGBA&amp;quot;)
    else:
        # If it&#39;s not RGBA, directly convert the image to grayscale mode
        final_image = image.convert(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
    # Get the original image file name and extension

    # Define the new image file name with _bw suffix for black and white
    new_file_name = file_name + &amp;quot;_bw&amp;quot; + file_ext
    # Save the new image, optimizing quality to reduce file size
    try:
        final_image.save(new_file_name, optimize=True)
    except Exception as e:

        return None, None
    # Get the original image and new image file sizes, and return
    old_size = os.path.getsize(image_file)
    new_size = os.path.getsize(new_file_name)
    return file_name, old_size, new_size

# Define a function to parse command-line arguments and return the folder path and extension list
def parse_args():
    # Create an argument parser object
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=&amp;quot;Convert images to black and white and optimize quality.&amp;quot;)
    # Add a required positional argument, representing the folder path
    parser.add_argument(&amp;quot;folder_path&amp;quot;, help=&amp;quot;The path of the folder that contains the images.&amp;quot;)

    parser.add_argument(&amp;quot;-e&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;--extensions&amp;quot;, nargs=&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;, default=[&amp;quot;.png&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.jpg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.jpeg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.gif&amp;quot;], help=&amp;quot;The extensions of the image files.&amp;quot;)
    # Parse command-line arguments and return the result object
    args = parser.parse_args()
    return args.folder_path, args.extensions

# Define a function to print the comparison of file sizes before and after optimization
def print_result(result):
    # If the result is not empty, indicating successful conversion and saving
    if result:
        # Unpack the result into a tuple of filename and file size tuple
        if len(result) == 3:

            # Display the comparison of file sizes before and after optimization in the console
            logging.info(f&amp;quot;{file}: {old_size} bytes -&amp;gt; {new_size} bytes&amp;quot;)
        else:

                    handlers=[logging.StreamHandler(),
                              logging.FileHandler(&amp;quot;log.txt&amp;quot;)])

# Call the function to get the folder path and extension list
folder_path, extensions = parse_args()

if __name__ == &amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot;:
    # Windows needs this function because Windows lacks the fork() function (not entirely accurate).
    # Therefore, on Windows, forking is simulated by creating a new process, and the code - Additionally, this new process is instructed to run the code passed through a pipe by passing the `--multiprocessing-fork` command-line argument to it.
- If you examine the implementation of the `freeze_support()` function, its task is to check which process it&#39;s running in and whether it should execute the code passed through a pipe.
- `multiprocessing.freeze_support()`

- A process pool is created, automatically allocating processes based on the number of cores on the computer.
- An empty list, `results`, is created to store the result objects of asynchronous tasks.
- The script iterates through all files in the folder:
- The full file path is constructed using `os.path.join()`.
- It checks if the file ends with any of the extensions specified in the `extensions` list (you can modify this list as needed).
- If it&#39;s an image file, the `convert_and_save` function is called to convert and save the image asynchronously, without blocking the main process. The file size is also obtained.  The result object is then added to the `results` list using `pool.apply_async()` with the callback function `print_result`.
- The process pool is closed to stop accepting new tasks.
- `pool.join()` is called to wait for all tasks in the pool to complete.

## Epilogue
Due to local development being on a `windows` system, the first answer given by `AI` did not include the `main` function and also lacked `multiprocessing.freeze_support`. The code was fixed after following up and encountering an error. 
Just as learning the techniques of search engines required skill, we also need to learn how to communicate with `AI`, providing reasonable and sufficient constraints to efficiently obtain the desired answers.
Note: **If you are a programming beginner, if you still don&#39;t understand certain parts of the code based on the given comments, please continue to ask related questions.**&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>WeChat Mini Program Background and Development Environment</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wechat-mini-program-background-and-development-environment/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 21:59:11 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wechat-mini-program-background-and-development-environment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;WeChat Mini Program Introduction and Development Preparation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-mini-programs-exist&#34;&gt;Why Mini Programs Exist
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; Slow web loading and blank screens; native app experience is faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standards &amp;amp; Management:&lt;/strong&gt; For WeChat, onboarding and management
Before mini programs were released, WeChat published an SDK called &lt;code&gt;JSDk&lt;/code&gt; to open up some of the original WeChat capabilities: WeChat Pay, coupons. However, developers used web development languages to develop logic, bypassing some WeChat regulations. Mini Programs have their own description language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-mini-programs&#34;&gt;What are Mini Programs?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mini programs are applications that can be used without needing to download and install them. They realize the dream of having applications &lt;strong&gt;within easy reach&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can open an application simply by scanning a code or searching for it. This also embodies the concept of &lt;strong&gt;use-it-and-leave-it&lt;/strong&gt; – users don’t need to worry about installing too many apps.  Applications will be ubiquitous and available at any time, but &lt;strong&gt;without needing to install or uninstall&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;differences-between-mini-programs-and-mobile-applications&#34;&gt;Differences Between Mini Programs and Mobile Applications
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No installation required, doesn&amp;rsquo;t occupy memory, easy to spread: QR code scanning, mini program cards, Search One Search (Sohu Search)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-mini-programs-can-do&#34;&gt;What Mini Programs Can Do
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content Tools: Zhihu Hot Rankings, Weibo Hot Topics, Mobike Bikes, Today Headline, Tencent Maps, Tencent Translate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail: Pinduoduo, JD.com Shopping, Mugujie, Daily Fresh, Xiaomi Mall, Watsons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games: Jump Rope, Happy Mahjong, Happy Dou Dizhu, Duoyue Live Streaming, YY Live Streaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Course content is from 2018; some application vendors have already gone bankrupt now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;development-preparation&#34;&gt;Development Preparation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register a Mini Program Account: Simply fill in the information normally, and click the activation link on the email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log into the Mini Program Management Backstage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete Mini Program Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bind Developer: For individual developers, use the WeChat account you’re logged in with as the administrator account; no additional binding is required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email has certain restrictions – it needs a new email address, but you can apply aliases for QQ emails, and the WeChat background will not verify them. After trying this, the name of the mini program is quite troublesome. As soon as it involves trademarks, it’s prone to audit failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can select service categories and also add custom ones; a Mini Program can add five categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Settings, you can view the Mini Program&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;ID&lt;/code&gt; information and enable message push notifications.  Enabling message push allows you to use the Message Template function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;developer-tools-as-described-by-the-author&#34;&gt;Developer Tools (as described by the author)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal download and installation, with no special notes – just a basic understanding. Simply enter in Guest Mode, and if you want to enable mobile debugging (i.e., view the mini-program development version on your phone), you need to log into the mini-program developer account, then click Settings, and switch to the specified mini-program’s &lt;code&gt;ID&lt;/code&gt; within Project Details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-structure&#34;&gt;Code Structure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;js: Interaction logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;json: Data configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wxml: UI elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wxss: UI styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;migration&#34;&gt;Migration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closing up shop, packing everything away, a familiar route, a new workstation – adjusting computer cabling, finding a comfortable posture to start working.
(ÒωÓױ)! – Connecting the network cable, the servers frequently used by the team were inaccessible. I tried switching to wireless networking, and access was normal again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought it was a problem with the server’s IP address range settings. The wired network at the new workstation wasn&amp;rsquo;t included in the firewall configuration list. After contacting IT colleagues to adjust it, the issue was resolved. This IP address range wasn’t just for one server; when trying to access other servers, they were all functioning normally. Gradually, I began to feel confused? Let professional people handle professional matters – eventually, the operations department colleague identified that this server had &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; deployed, and the default network of the &lt;code&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; service conflicted with the wired network configuration of the office, causing data packets sent to it to not receive responses and being routed to the &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other servers didn’t have the &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; service deployed, so only this one was affected. I frequently used it, and occasionally used containers to deploy some testing services – I never expected to encounter such a scenario. Later, thinking about it in detail, since the entire group was located within the same office building, IT colleagues divided IP address ranges using addresses starting with &lt;code&gt;172&lt;/code&gt;, which wasn’t unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker0&#34;&gt;docker0

{
    &amp;quot;bip&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;172.200.0.1/24&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart the service and switch to the new network; the server recovers normal access.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Embedded Systems – Getting Started Part 1 – Technical Terms</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/embedded-entry-professional-terms/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 13:42:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/embedded-entry-professional-terms/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s the English translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I think of embedded systems, my mind immediately goes back to the 51-pin single-chip microcomputers and Texas Instruments we used in university labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LPA3399Pro is a visual host developed on the HiSilicon RK3399Pro platform, designed for portable computing hosts that require extensive visual computation. It features an integrated NPU compute unit with 3.0 TOPS of processing power and supports various algorithm models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RV1109 is HiSilicon’s SoC for machine vision within its AI branch, featuring a dedicated NPU. RV1109 provides 1TOPS of processing power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;system-on-chip&#34;&gt;System on Chip
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoC stands for System on a Chip, meaning “chiplet system.” It’s a technology that integrates multiple electronic systems onto a single chip. This technology can significantly reduce the size and weight of electronic products while simultaneously improving performance and lowering power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoC (System on a Chip) and CPU (Central Processing Unit) are both important components of computer systems, but they have some distinctions between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPU is the core processor within a computer system, responsible for executing program instructions. It typically only contains basic components such as arithmetic logic units, control units, and registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An SoC, on the other hand, integrates multiple electronic systems onto a single chip, including a CPU, along with other components like memory, graphics processors, and input/output interfaces. This allows for significant reductions in product size and weight while boosting performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the CPU is a component of an SoC, whereas the SoC represents a more complex and highly integrated electronic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;microcontroller-unit&#34;&gt;Microcontroller Unit
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoC (System on a Chip) and MCU (Microcontroller Unit) are technologies that integrate multiple electronic systems onto a single chip, but there are also some differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MCU is a microcontroller, typically containing a CPU, memory, input/output interfaces, and other basic components. It’s commonly used to control other electronic devices such as household appliances and automotive electronics systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An SoC, on the other hand, integrates more electronic systems onto a single chip, in addition to the basic components of an MCU, it can also integrate other components like graphics processors and wireless communication modules. This significantly reduces the size and weight of electronic products while improving performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, an MCU is a simple microcontroller, whereas an SoC is a more complex and highly integrated electronic system.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AI-assisted programming, the evolution of productivity</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-assisted-programming-productivity-evolution/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 17:05:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-assisted-programming-productivity-evolution/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“GitHub Copilot” was released less than two years ago, and “ChatGPT” has appeared. I don’t fully understand the underlying principles; I&amp;rsquo;ve been using them for a while. The two tools’ levels of assistance are completely different, but they have both achieved a significant increase in productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For things that are too complex, AI still can’t do it, because they lack logic, or they rely on patterns or fixed frameworks – the training data is sufficient, and AI’s effect is nine out of ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-copilot&#34;&gt;GitHub Copilot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When publishing, I looked at the official introduction’s “demo” and found it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very smart. After trying it out, it wasn’t great, so I gave up on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 2022, when I had some free time, I switched to the new version to try it out, and the effect was already quite good. The only issue was that the speed in China was a bit slow, likely due to network reasons. For languages like &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;, the code generated based on comments was pretty good, and much faster than researching and writing code myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chatgpt&#34;&gt;ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Github Copilot&lt;/code&gt; still focuses on developers, i.e., from a development perspective when designing the product, requiring you to understand how to program and guide AI assistance through comments.
&lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt; has moved to the next level, &lt;strong&gt;allowing non-experts to quickly get started&lt;/strong&gt;.  A conversational chat interface where you can pose questions, describe requirements, and ask for clarification if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example: You know about tokenization but don’t know how to code, wanting to calculate the similarity of strings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;Python 分词计算 維天運通 LOGORY 和 合肥維天運通信息科技股份有限公司 两个字符串的相似度；
比较前，统一处理字符串，英文转换为小写；
第二个字符中如果能找到第一个字符的首字符，将第二个字符串截位，截位的长度为第一个字符串的长度
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, this is Bing. 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to online information 123, Python tokenization can be implemented using the &lt;code&gt;jieba&lt;/code&gt; library. The &lt;code&gt;jieba&lt;/code&gt; library supports three segmentation modes: precise mode, full mode, and search engine mode. You can choose an appropriate mode based on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare two strings, you first need to tokenize them and then calculate their word vectors or edit distance metrics. You can use libraries like NumPy or SciPy for mathematical operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To standardize string processing, converting English to lowercase, you can use Python&amp;rsquo;s built-in &lt;code&gt;lower()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To slice the second string, you can use Python’s slicing operator [].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a possible code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import jieba
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

# Define two strings
str1 = &amp;quot;維天運通 LOGORY&amp;quot;
str2 = &amp;quot;合肥維天運通信息科技股份有限公司&amp;quot;

# Standardize the string, convert English to lowercase
str1 = str1.lower()
str2 = str2.lower()

# Find the position of the first character of the first string in the second string
index = str2.find(str1[0])

# If found, slice the second string
if index != -1:
    str2 = str2[index:index+len(str1)]

# Tokenize the two strings using the jieba library
words1 = list(jieba.cut(str1))
words2 = list(jieba.cut(str2))

# Calculate the word vectors of the two strings (using frequency as weights)
vector1 = np.zeros(len(words1))
vector2 = np.zeros(len(words1))

for i, word in enumerate(words1):
    vector1[i] += 1 # Count the number of times each word appears in the first string
    if word in words2:
        vector2[i] += 1 # Count the number of times each word appears in the second string

# Calculate the similarity between the two strings (using cosine distance as an index)
similarity = 1 - cosine(vector1, vector2)

print(&amp;quot;The similarity between the two strings is:&amp;quot;, similarity)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Furthermore, consult the results of running and congratulations, you have discovered a problem. The result is fabricated, it does not actually run the code, but will give you a good result.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question: SQL statement to retrieve records from the product code table where the product code is within the range 80000-89999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;Hello, this is Bing. 😊

According to search result 12, you can use the SQL BETWEEN operator to select values within a given range. The BETWEEN operator includes both the start and end values.

You need to first specify the table name and column name that you want to query, and then use the BETWEEN operator and the range value in the WHERE clause.

For example, if you want to retrieve records from the product code table where the product code is between 80000 and 89999, you can use the following statement:

SELECT * FROM product_code
WHERE code BETWEEN 80000 AND 89999;
Here, &#39;*&#39; represents selecting all columns [3]. If you only want to select specific columns, such as name and price, you can separate them with commas, as shown below:

SELECT name, price FROM product_code
WHERE code BETWEEN 80000 AND 89999;

I hope this helps.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue questioning, negating it: The product code is a string, your code is wrong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;Sorry, I didn&#39;t notice that the product code is a string. If that’s the case, you need to add single quotes around both ends of the range values, as follows:

SELECT * FROM product_code
WHERE code BETWEEN &#39;80000&#39; AND &#39;89999&#39;;

Please forgive my mistake. 🙏

Congratulations, it will recognize mistakes.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Bonded Customs Clearance with Hong Kong Dollar and Renminbi</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hk-rmb-dual-counter/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 20:25:47 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hk-rmb-dual-counter/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing (HKEX) announced on December 13th that it will soon launch the “Hong Kong-Renminbi Dual Counter Model” (hereinafter referred to as “Dual Counter Model”) and dual counter broker mechanisms for its securities markets, further supporting RMB-designated listings, trading, and settlement in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dual-listing-model-and-dual-listing-broker-mechanism&#34;&gt;Dual-Listing Model and Dual-Listing Broker Mechanism
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) stated that the registration procedures for these new measures are expected to begin implementation in the first half of 2023, pending regulatory approval and market readiness. Under the dual-listing model, HKEX will optimize related trading and settlement arrangements, allowing investors to swap securities issued by the same issuer on both the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) and Renminbi (RMB) trading venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance liquidity in the RMB trading venue and narrow the price difference between the two venues, HKEX will introduce a dual-listing broker mechanism. Once relevant legislation is passed by the Legislative Council, market makers engaging in supply activities will be exempt from stamp duty when conducting specific transactions. Simultaneously, these new measures will also prepare for subsequent mainland investors to trade securities priced in RMB through the Hong Kong Connect (HKT) scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The launch of the dual-listing model of Hong Kong Dollar-Renminbi and the dual-listing broker mechanism is a key measure for the development of our market. In conjunction with our other market initiatives, this arrangement will help attract more dual-listing securities to be listed in Hong Kong, complementing the existing mainland products at HKEX. HKEX is committed to actively promoting the internationalization of RMB and continuously enhancing Hong Kong’s position as a leading offshore RMB center globally.”  Said Mr. Yao Kai-yan, Chief Operating Officer and Head of Markets at HKEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is noted that the current listing, trading, settlement, and clearing arrangements in the Hong Kong stock market will largely apply to RMB securities under the dual-listing model. HKEX will announce the implementation date of the dual-listing model and the list of eligible dual-listing securities included in the broker mechanism at an appropriate time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-identify-hong-kong-dollar-renminbi-trading-booths&#34;&gt;How to Identify Hong Kong Dollar-Renminbi Trading Booths
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) documentation indicates that the Hong Kong dollar-Renminbi dual listing arrangement will largely follow the existing stock code allocation plan, meaning Hong Kong dollar booths will have stock codes starting with “0” followed by five digits, while Renminbi booths will have stock codes starting with “8” followed by five digits. The last four digits of both Hong Kong dollar and Renminbi booth stock codes will be identical. Renminbi booth stock abbreviations will be appended with &amp;ldquo;-R&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding trading arrangements, based on the fact that securities in both the Renminbi and Hong Kong dollar booths belong to the same category and can be converted into each other, if one booth (such as the Hong Kong dollar booth) allows for short selling of specified securities, the other booth (such as the Renminbi booth) can also be included as eligible for short selling according to exchange rules. Correspondingly, both booths will be listed in the specified securities lists that are available for short selling on the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the stocks in both booths belong to the same category and can be converted into each other, buying or holding the stock in Renminbi while selling it in Hong Kong dollars will be considered a carry trade (short sale), and vice versa. Settlement times between the two booths are T+2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For specified securities eligible for short selling, such as borrowing stocks in Hong Kong dollars and then selling them on the Renminbi booth, this will be treated as a secured short sale, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that under the dual booth model, since the Renminbi booth is only for trading and settlement, it will not provide physical stock deposits or withdrawals; physical stocks can only be deposited after being held in the Hong Kong dollar booth and then converted to the Renminbi booth. Similarly, the Renminbi booth must be converted to the Hong Kong dollar booth before physical stocks can be withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Hong Kong settlement and clearing fees, excluding dividend collection service fees and interest collection service fees, will be calculated and charged in Hong Kong dollars. Dividend collection service fees and interest collection service fees will be calculated using the currency adopted for the relevant securities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>- Compiler
- Callback Function
- Performance Testing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/compiler-callback-performance-testing/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 13:59:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/compiler-callback-performance-testing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last year, an SDK was designed to handle encapsulating certain events and provide a class interface externally. During service initialization, the caller implements the corresponding classes and passes the object pointer to the module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with C11 piqued my curiosity, leading me to explore what would happen if these interfaces were implemented using lambda function objects instead of pure virtual function definitions. Compared to the traditional interface definition method, it seemed more flexible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The question arose: with two different syntaxes, which one is faster from a performance perspective? Not understanding compiler principles, I decided to try out some code to find out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online website, allowing you to select different compilers, compilation parameters, run code on the &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt; platform, or view corresponding assembly code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wandbox.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://wandbox.org/&lt;/a&gt; : Sometimes useful for technical validation; executing small code snippets in a web browser is very convenient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://godbolt.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://godbolt.org/&lt;/a&gt; : Using different colors to distinguish the corresponding assembly code for each line, it’s more convenient than using a local debugger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;body&#34;&gt;Body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Standards Committee established grammatical rules, and at the compilation level, how it’s implemented depends on each compiler vendor. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that Microsoft’s compiler is quite powerful here. Syntax sugar isn’t a panacea; callback interfaces aren’t abundant, using &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; expressions is more convenient and eliminates the need to define empty callback function interfaces. When callback interfaces become numerous, traditional virtual functions are advantageous for unifying business interface definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; platform, performance is close, with little difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt; platform, a comparison of virtual functions and &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; reveals a 1.35ns overhead per call.
In typical business system development, this level of performance loss can be ignored; introducing &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; brings greater convenience in design. This is particularly noticeable when dealing with multi-signal processing – the underlying event triggering mechanism, along with handling functions for logging objects when events are triggered. When more business processing interfaces are needed, &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; objects are stored in a &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt;, and they’re iterated through sequentially during event triggering, similar to Qt&amp;rsquo;s signals and slots; logging, monitoring, business 1, and business 2 are completely decoupled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Here are two modes that have been added: a regular function and a functor. They provide an interface callback mechanism and comparison with direct calls, resulting in a qualitative difference in performance loss. Functors perform close to functions, and sometimes even outperform them. The compilation principle is somewhat of a knowledge blind spot; I suspect it&#39;s due to the addresses of accessed variables and the proximity of functions, which benefits `CPU` processing.

Attached is the output from running with `wandbox`.

        <title>Host byte, network byte, observe directly through debugger</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/host-network-byte-order-debugger/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 14:18:12 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/host-network-byte-order-debugger/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the history of computer development, there has been no unified standard for data storage. There are two commonly used rules for byte arrangement. For example, if the low-order bits of a multi-digit number are placed at smaller addresses and the high-order bits are placed at larger addresses, it is referred to as little-endian; conversely, it is called big-endian. In network applications, byte order is a factor that must be considered because different types of machines may adopt different standards, so they are all converted according to the network standard.
According to reading habits, big-endian byte order is more consistent with the left-to-right reading order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;processor-architecturehttpszhwikipediaorgwikie5ad97e88a82e5ba8f&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AD%97%E8%8A%82%E5%BA%8F&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Processor Architecture&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processors such as x86, MOS Technology 6502, Z80, VAX, and PDP-11 use little-endian byte order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processors like Motorola 6800, Motorola 68000, PowerPC 970 use big-endian byte order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The byte order of processors such as ARM, PowerPC (excluding PowerPC 970), DEC Alpha, SPARC V9, MIPS, PA-RISC and IA64 is configurable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;network-byte-order&#34;&gt;Network Byte Order
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network transmission generally uses big-endian byte order, also known as network byte order or network order. The IP protocol defines big-endian as the network byte order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Berkeley&lt;/code&gt; sockets API defined a set of conversion functions to convert 16 and 32-bit integers between network byte order and host byte order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;arpa/inet.h&amp;gt;

uint32_t htonl(uint32_t hostlong); // Converts a uint32_t from host byte order to network byte order
uint16_t htons(uint16_t hostshort); // Converts a uint16_t from host byte order to network byte order
uint32_t ntohl(uint32_t netlong); // Converts a uint32_t from network byte order to host byte order
uint16_t ntohs(uint16_t netshort); // Converts a uint16_t from network byte order to host byte order
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If using &lt;code&gt;asio&lt;/code&gt; as the networking library, its internal namespace provides cross-platform adaptation functions with different names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::host_to_network_long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::host_to_network_short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio-debugger&#34;&gt;Visual Studio Debugger
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In debugging mode, select the Debug menu, Window, and checkmark the Memory window. Within &lt;code&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/code&gt;, you can directly view data in memory using the debugger, as shown in the following image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/host-network-byte-order-debugger/Snipaste_2023-01-10_14-44-00.png&#34;

	height=&#34;147&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;363&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;873px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ways-to-view-memory&#34;&gt;Ways to View Memory
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The window directly outputs &amp;amp;variable name and jumps to the corresponding variable address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the variable is originally a pointer, double-click on the variable to select it and drag it to the memory window to display the content at the corresponding address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the variable is not a pointer, add it to the calculation window to obtain its address, then manually copy it to the memory window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receive a data segment, stored in the &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt; object, convert network byte order to host byte order, resulting in &lt;code&gt;body_length&lt;/code&gt; being 30. The server allocates four bytes for transmitting this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;bool NetworkMessage::decode_header()
{
    // Network byte order to host byte order
    body_length_ = boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_long(*(int *)buffer_.data());
    return auto_reserve(body_length_);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Back then, as a young boy, he might have had talent, but it wasn’t common.</title>

        <pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 13:45:09 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/that-boy-talent-maybe-but-not-much/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s my seventh year in the job, and I’m not getting as much positive feedback on the code I write. Let me reflect on how I ended up on this &lt;code&gt;coding&lt;/code&gt; path. People’s choices, especially when they&amp;rsquo;re younger, tend to follow positive reinforcement more closely – actively avoiding harm and seeking benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-childhood&#34;&gt;I. Childhood
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving to the city and coming into contact with computer books? Hacker’s materials? Meeting Windows systems – these are all anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The time should be positioned around childhood and sneaking around with my cousin to play games on our parents&amp;rsquo; computer.&lt;/strong&gt; My cousin and I ran a shop with our uncle at the computer store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started having exposure to computers relatively early, and basic understanding was established. Later, in school, taking the microcomputer course also sparked an interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In middle school, I heard about computer competitions, which seemed really cool, but after transferring schools, this fell by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my junior high years, I was familiar with basic computer operations, and I could easily stand out during microcomputer classes. If you’re still familiar, yes, you&amp;rsquo;ve noticed, it wasn’t proficiency – being familiar with office software would be even more impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-moving--relocation&#34;&gt;II. Moving / Relocation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit the moving situation. When we moved to the city center, due to the neighbors, we came into contact with the library. Although we read quite a few novels, we also read a lot of magazines, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computer News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;大众软件&lt;/em&gt; (Greatest Software)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led to an increasingly growing interest in computers as a product. The childhood fascination with hackers was actively pursued through relevant knowledge at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned the basics of operating systems: control panel, CMD commands, VBS scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computer News&lt;/em&gt; is suitable for beginners; each time it explains system operations in the form of case studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greatest Software&lt;/em&gt; recommends various software, industry news, &lt;strong&gt;and of course, game news – this was the initial motivation, and it also planted the seed for gaming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-high-school&#34;&gt;III. High School
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, Bo Ge transferred to our class, and &lt;strong&gt;several seniors had been guaranteed admission through computer competitions in the previous two years&lt;/strong&gt;. The school leaders also paid a lot of attention to this competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a prerequisite hardware foundation – an alumnus from America donated a building to the school, which resulted in a new library and a new computer lab; it all seemed so coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus Bo Ge’s popular science lectures, he was considered the computer guru in our class at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scholar + computer expert, knew how to hack into other people&amp;rsquo;s computers and disable classroom surveillance software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-high-school-1&#34;&gt;III. High School
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competitions were bumpy and ultimately ended in the finals, where I didn’t quite understand the material and the questions were mostly basic algorithms. However, it was still a worthwhile experience – like taking a short trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-university&#34;&gt;Four. University
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waiting for university major selection, I chose automation based on my parents&amp;rsquo; recommendation, but I actually wanted to pursue electrical engineering, intending to join the power supply bureau upon graduation. I didn’t learn much in the courses of my major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My self-driven learning ability was almost non-existent within the major courses; however, I found computer courses within the large curriculum very easy to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended classes for the major course while skipping lectures and diligently studied computer courses. I spent my daily time browsing forums: “JingYi Forum” (“I Love Crack”),
Combining what I learned from that bit of assembly and C++ knowledge with the skills gained from taking on orders from the forums, I earned more positive feedback and went further and further down this path, unable to be pulled back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the choice of a minor led me to choose writing code for chips, and my parents didn’t interfere much, letting me make my own decision.
At that time, &lt;strong&gt;the third key figure: my cousin&lt;/strong&gt; had a high education and worked at Baidu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My elder sister understood me and knew that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been focused on research back then, so she encouraged me to talk to my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confirmed the future development path, didn’t go home during the summer vacation, followed my advisor to work on projects, and gained experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my still-passable grades, I was admitted to Hengsheng Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;five-graduation&#34;&gt;Five. Graduation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a key point I know – I learned how to bypass firewalls, took elective courses in Computer Information Retrieval, and quickly found and located information and problems. A valuable colleague, &lt;strong&gt;Mr. [硕哥&amp;rsquo;s nickname]&lt;/strong&gt;, appeared at work, gave me time to learn independently, troubleshoot issues down to their roots, and introduced me to the leaders of the R&amp;amp;D center.
These experiences laid the groundwork; in Shenzhen, everyone outside viewed me as exceptionally skilled, successfully leading the transaction channel group.
That’s where the problem lies: I lacked systematic learning in computer operating systems, algorithms, and software engineering design. All my knowledge was based on my own past experience.
This led to frequent self-doubt regarding my code designs, a lack of guidelines for module design, and ultimately, fatigue after seven years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>China’s COVID-19 lockdown easing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-coronavirus-end-lockdown/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 19:22:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-coronavirus-end-lockdown/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The policy announcement was incredibly sudden, and its implementation was swift – the Health Code QR code was lifted, and checks for green codes in public places ceased. Browsing the Chinese-language version of The New York Times, the entire front page was dominated by discussions about China’s reopening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t comment on the policies; I’m simply recording what’s happening around me. Originally, Beijing had no zero-COVID policy, but the relaxation of restrictions spread rapidly, resulting in widespread infections. Among my friends, none were seriously ill. Shenzhen, bordering Guangzhou, also began to develop quickly. As I write this, with colleagues based in the suburbs of Shanghai, there haven’t been any large-scale outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back home, the protective measures were minimal, and they spread rapidly. Most people likely experienced a similar feeling – suddenly, restrictions were lifted, with new policies announced weekly until a full reopening was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s undeniable that the three years of zero-COVID policy had an effect; we must adapt to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>C11: sleep for vs yield</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/c11-sleep-for-vs-yield/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 20:54:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/c11-sleep-for-vs-yield/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While reviewing the code, &lt;code&gt;std::this_thread::yield()&lt;/code&gt; suddenly popped into my view, a syntax sugar from &lt;code&gt;C11&lt;/code&gt; that I’d used quite a bit, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t consult the manual; first, I thought it had something to do with asynchronous operations – the word was used in the coroutine implementation of the Boost library.  Clearly, it wasn’t related to coroutines; it’s about controlling logic within a regular thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;documentation&#34;&gt;Documentation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;yield&#34;&gt;yield
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accuracy of this function depends on the implementation, particularly the OS scheduler mechanism and system state used. For example, the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) real-time scheduler (Linux’s SCHED_FIFO) will suspend the current thread and place it at the end of the queue for other threads with the same priority that are ready to run (and has no effect if there are no other threads with the same priority).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sleep_for&#34;&gt;sleep_for
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocks the current thread&amp;rsquo;s execution for at least the specified &lt;code&gt;sleep_duration&lt;/code&gt;.
This function may block longer than &lt;code&gt;sleep_duration&lt;/code&gt; due to scheduling or resource contention delays.
The standard library recommends measuring durations using a monotonic clock. If implementing with system time instead, waiting times may be sensitive to clock adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both functions are designed to release the current thread and its associated resources, with the actual effect depending on the platform. I’m still a bit unclear at this point, so let&amp;rsquo;s run the code to see the execution results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThinkPad laptop (Visual Studio Community 2022), Tencent Cloud S2 Standard Server (gcc8.5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-1&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Execution Platform&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Function&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;First/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Second/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Third/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-2&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Execution Platform&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Function&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;First Time / us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Second Time / us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Third Time / us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-3&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Execution Platform&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Function&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;First/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Second/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Third/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-4&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Execution Platform&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Function&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;First/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Second/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Third/us&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-5&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the results, it’s clear that due to differences in operating system implementations, the stability of high-precision sleep varies greatly. If you want high-precision sleep, using &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; is more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time precision is increased to &lt;code&gt;ms&lt;/code&gt;, the difference between the two methods is not significant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linux Server, Reset MySQL Password</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-server-reset-mysql-password/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 14:27:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-server-reset-mysql-password/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an idle Tencent Cloud server that was expiring at the end of the year and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t planned to renew it. So, I decided to deploy a MySQL database for development purposes. When reinstalling the system, I wanted to save time and chose a third-party image provided by Tencent Cloud, which already had MySQL installed. I thought the system should include a Readme file or similar documentation explaining the password and deployment path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tencent Cloud server reinstalled very quickly, taking about a minute. Once logged in, &lt;code&gt;systemctl status mysql&lt;/code&gt; showed that the service was running. I started searching for the password but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it anywhere, and I began to panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I thought, since I had already accessed the server with root privileges, there must be a way to reset the password. I searched through documentation and found a forum post on Alibaba Cloud’s forum, continuing to tinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reset-password&#34;&gt;Reset Password
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the configuration file &lt;code&gt;vim /etc/my.cnf&lt;/code&gt;, add the following configuration to the &lt;code&gt;mysqld&lt;/code&gt; node: &lt;code&gt;skip-grant-tables&lt;/code&gt;, and execute the command to restart the database: &lt;code&gt;systemctl restart mysql&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, log in directly to the data using &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt;, after which everything will proceed normally. To reset the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; user password and enable allowing remote login simultaneously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;USE mysql;
UPDATE user SET authentication_string = password(&#39;pass&#39;) WHERE User = &#39;root&#39;;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO &#39;root&#39;@&#39;%&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;pass&#39; WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To revert the modified configuration file, restart the database, and you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Onomatopoeia of the Night</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/nights-naming-art/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 22:10:14 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/nights-naming-art/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation of the provided text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the vast system of Chinese characters, the character “命” (life/fate) is utterly unique; there isn’t even a single homophone. Perhaps this subtly suggests that each person’s life has only one opportunity, cannot be replicated, and cannot be relived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During leisure time, I browsed the rankings on Qidian Chinese Net, and “The Nomenclature of Nights” consistently topped the charts with an overwhelming number of monthly votes, far surpassing the second-place book – a gap that was truly daunting. For many years, I had primarily read works by well-known authors like Tang Jiaqian and Ergen. This time, I decided to try a new author’s work and experience a different reading sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of early August, “The Nomenclature of Nights” had amassed a staggering two million monthly votes, while the second book only garnered eight hundred thousand – the disparity was astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I acknowledge my own lack of knowledge and ability to critically evaluate the author&amp;rsquo;s writing style. However, after reading through more than fifteen chapters, I found that the plot was tightly woven and intricately connected, captivating and engaging. Given such high monthly vote numbers, it’s undeniably well-deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, just like “命,” the character “死” (death) also has no homophones within the Chinese character system. Does this similarly imply a unique and irreplaceable depth regarding the end of life?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Brief Overview of Automated Testing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/automated-testing-overview/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 11:39:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/automated-testing-overview/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The investment in testing for financial trading systems far exceeded that of other systems, with tedious test steps repeatedly executed and a low &lt;code&gt;ROI&lt;/code&gt;. As projects and personnel changed, uncontrollable factors inevitably introduced, a common situation being the modification of a field output from Interface A impacting the results of Interface B. With each version release, risk also accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theoretical-knowledge&#34;&gt;Theoretical Knowledge
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Measure the Value of Automation?&lt;/strong&gt;
An automation testing ROI = (Manual Execution Time) * (Number of Runs) / (Development Cost + Maintenance Cost)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Features Should Be Automated?&lt;/strong&gt;
Frequently used features that are unlikely to change. Writing automated test code for this type of interface yields the highest returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Choose This Timing to Drive Automation Testing?&lt;/strong&gt;
Not appropriate near project launch – distant water doesn’t quench immediate thirst; automation is a long-term return model. It&amp;rsquo;s most suitable when the project is already in a &lt;strong&gt;production environment&lt;/strong&gt; and within a stable release cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;framework-selection&#34;&gt;Framework Selection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the task of automation testing without prior practical experience, a typical starting point is to open a search engine and find tools and frameworks that can be used with the current system’s &lt;strong&gt;technology stack&lt;/strong&gt;, review the user manuals, and get started. If you can immediately find a suitable tool, congratulations, &lt;strong&gt;perfect start&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this by saying I might be wrong. After reviewing relevant materials, it&amp;rsquo;s not that these frameworks don’t exist; rather, they are too complex and consume excessive resources. For beginners, what’s needed is something small, streamlined, and concise. Consulting with colleagues in the testing group led to the suggestion of a &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; self-built framework – essentially, wrapping existing unit testing frameworks into an automated testing framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referencing the design thinking for this project: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/wintests/pytestDemo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/wintests/pytestDemo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-use-a-framework&#34;&gt;Why Use a Framework?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Services have multiple different deployment environments – development, testing, and live testing environments. The purpose of a framework is to act as an abstraction layer, separating test cases and data. This allows for configuring different case data according to various environment configurations, and it also supports shared data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core logic is focused on increasing the utilization of automation. When scenarios become more complex, the data between different environments is completely unrelated and has no bearing on each other. Simply add a &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; tag when specifying case data to indicate the supported environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Do We Need to Learn a New Language?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/why-learn-a-new-language/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting from my academic years, I’ve been working with &lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; for over ten years. So, why do I need to learn other programming languages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work experience: Lacking experience in elegant module design, &lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; syntax is freeform. Learning other languages helps me guide the development of more elegant designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often use them when writing some tools. The design principles for low-level libraries and business modules are also becoming clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visual Studio Compilation Character Set [Converted]</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-character-set/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 10:51:43 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; cross-platform development. Commonly encountered on Chinese operating systems: &lt;code&gt;error C2001&lt;/code&gt; - constant contains a newline character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio&#34;&gt;Visual Studio
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmake&lt;/code&gt; organizes the project compilation script, generating a temporary solution under the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; system for development. The reason for cross-platform compatibility is that the file encoding is chosen as &lt;code&gt;utf-8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cited reference provides a detailed explanation of the causes of the problem from first principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding encoding, &lt;code&gt;MSVC&lt;/code&gt; has dedicated compilation options &lt;code&gt;/source-charset&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/execution-charset&lt;/code&gt;. The former indicates the encoding of the file itself, and the latter indicates what encoding the byte array inside the compiled character set is. Encoding issues can basically be solved using these two options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt; console defaults to displaying &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt; encoding. However, the code file itself is &lt;code&gt;utf-8&lt;/code&gt;. Because of cross-platform considerations and it&amp;rsquo;s inconvenient to directly convert it to &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt;, we don’t include the method of writing encoding conversion code for different platforms. On &lt;code&gt;Win10&lt;/code&gt;, we can set these compilation options to &lt;code&gt;/source-charset:utf-8 /execution-charset:gbk&lt;/code&gt;, indicating that the compiler reads in with &lt;code&gt;utf-8&lt;/code&gt; encoding and then converts it to &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt; to store in the array, so &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; can display Chinese characters normally in the &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt; console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cmake-configuration-for-visual-studio&#34;&gt;CMake Configuration for Visual Studio
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cmake&#34;&gt;if(WIN32)
    message(STATUS &amp;quot;Configuring trade on WIN32&amp;quot;)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS &amp;quot;${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} /source-charset:utf-8 /execution-charset:gbk&amp;quot;)
endif()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Pelosi Visits Taiwan</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/pelosi-visits-taiwan/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t know politics, don’t make comments, record this “carnival” on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;musings&#34;&gt;Musings
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Tangshan Assault Incident&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Primary School Textbook Cultural Invasion Incident&lt;/strong&gt; – I wonder how many people even remember them anymore. These trending news stories have become numbingly commonplace, without much feeling, and I just watch TV as usual after work, observing the spectacle. The economic situation is already dire; a war wouldn’t make things any better.  I don&amp;rsquo;t understand politics or offer commentary, simply recording this internet-fueled “carnival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wiki-overviewhttpszhwikipediaorgwiki2022e5b9b4e58d97e8a5bfc2b7e8a3b4e6b49be8a5bfe8a8aae5958fe58fb0e781a3&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E5%B9%B4%E5%8D%97%E8%A5%BF%C2%B7%E8%A3%B4%E6%B4%9B%E8%A5%BF%E8%A8%AA%E5%95%8F%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Wiki Overview&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nancy Pelosi visit to Taiwan, also known as the Pelosi visit to Taiwan, refers to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s 2022 visit to Asia, specifically her itinerary which included a stop in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the U.S. House Speaker being considered the third-highest official in the United States and plans to visit Taiwan, the date was approaching shortly before the Chinese People&amp;rsquo;s Liberation Army&amp;rsquo;s (PLA) 70th Founding Day on August 1st, and long-term it approached the Communist Party of China’s Twentieth National Congress, the 2022 U.S. elections, and the 2022 Taiwan local elections. The government of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China issued a strong protest, dispatching destroyer task forces to the northeast waters of the Taiwan Strait and mobilizing the Shandong and Liaoning aircraft carrier strike groups, with the Eastern Theater Command and Southern Theater Command conducting large-scale live-fire exercises in the East Sea and South China Sea respectively. On the U.S. side, the Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier strike group arrived around the Taiwan Strait to guard Pelosi’s possible visit itinerary, and multiple waves of reconnaissance aircraft and aerial refueling tankers were deployed on standby at Japan&amp;rsquo;s Camp Hikawa Air Base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden had a video meeting before the visit, which covered the issue of Taiwan. Taiwanese and international media reported that Speaker Pelosi and the House delegation would arrive at Songshan Airport in Taipei on the 2nd, stay overnight, and meet with Taiwan’s Presidential Office level officials including President Tsai Ing-wen on the 3rd. Some analysts believe this visit could potentially lead to a new crisis in the Taiwan Strait, similar to the 1996 Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis, after 26 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;08-11&#34;&gt;08-11
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By today, this has pretty much settled down. During this time, the headlines were dominated by various naval exercises, and Zhihu was putting in a lot of effort to update its trending charts every day, talking about all of this. Let the reporters work hard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Quickly calculate folder size on the Windows platform</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-platform-quick-folder-size-statistics/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 19:54:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-platform-quick-folder-size-statistics/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Linux platform is very simple: &lt;code&gt;du -sh *&lt;/code&gt; – just one line of code solves the problem. What about Windows? With many disks and a desire to clean up, with numerous files, the system’s built-in Resource Manager is too slow to calculate folder sizes, making you want to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;everything&#34;&gt;Everything
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers working on the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; platform, you probably haven&amp;rsquo;t personally used &lt;code&gt;everything&lt;/code&gt;, and should at least have heard of it. Its search speed far exceeds that of the built-in file explorer. Given that system-level support for fast indexing exists, we can certainly find similar tools that build file indexes while also calculating file sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wiztree&#34;&gt;WizTree
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Website: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.diskanalyzer.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.diskanalyzer.com/&lt;/a&gt;
Use the standard installation method or the green version to unzip and run.
It’s fast, with a wide variety of data display types – the left side features a tree diagram mode, the right side displays file types, and there&amp;rsquo;s also graphical visualization available at the bottom of the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spacesniffer-update-2023-no-longer-maintained&#34;&gt;SpaceSniffer (Update 2023 No Longer Maintained)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software Website: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation is very simple – select the corresponding drive letter, and the software will display folder sizes in a graphical way, with larger volumes resulting in larger matrices in the images.  Other operations are easily understood by simply clicking on them. It supports inputting filter conditions for files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File size filtering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File date filtering&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>How to Copy Webpage Stylesheets (CSS): Element Inspector</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-copy-webpage-css-element-inspect/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 23:36:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-copy-webpage-css-element-inspect/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Static blog themes, the mainstream is based on foreign templates, modified and adjusted without much consideration for Chinese content layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half a month ago, I adjusted the blog’s stylesheet – as I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing backend services for many years, I’m a pure newbie in frontend. After struggling with it for half a day, the design wasn’t quite reasonable. Suddenly an idea struck me: I looked at the technical blogs I often read – infoq and OpenChina – and their layouts look really good. Could I borrow some of those? After reviewing the source files, I got lost trying to locate the relevant elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontend developers might be laughing at this point… I didn’t understand how to locate the specified elements, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay; I have plenty of free time on weekends, so I stopped and thought about it. It reminded me of when I wrote Python crawlers – I had used something similar before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;element-inspection&#34;&gt;Element Inspection
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s right, it’s the browser&amp;rsquo;s built-in element inspection tool – copying stylesheets, locating specific elements, all done in minutes. &lt;code&gt;selector&lt;/code&gt; to locate elements, &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; to create a “user define css”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy outerHTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy selector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy JS path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy styles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy XPath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy full XPath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai GuoAn database incident, which caused a huge stir within the black hacking circles, remains unclear whether it’s true or false. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what we remember in two years and look back on it then. Based on past experience, I updated a batch of local social engineering databases, and I encountered a massive SQL file: 17.9G. A regular text editor couldn&amp;rsquo;t even preview it, let alone open it. Chatting with netizens, someone mentioned EmEditor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Text

    &gt;https://www.emeditor.com/&lt;/a&gt;
I took a look at it over the weekend and found it quite convenient. The design supports editing large files, and when sufficient memory is available, the entire file is loaded into memory, resulting in fast search and editing speeds. It also supports splitting files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Shanghai Fen Yong Guo (Shuang Yang Pot) Lockdown</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-sealed/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 23:03:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-sealed/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The leadership team insisted for two days that Shanghai wouldn’t be locked down, that Shanghai was important. But in the end, facing the reality or to preserve their own prestige, they came up with a strategy of closing across the Huangpu River first for a period of time, and then locking down this side of the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lockdown&#34;&gt;Lockdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I experienced the SARS epidemic and have very little memory of it. After seeing related materials, it ended because its incubation period was short and there wasn’t a nationwide spread yet. I remember being in primary school back then, with classes ending early every day, and the smell of disinfectant always lingering in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 has been raging for almost three years. Workers who travel abroad have become accustomed to it, wearing masks when they need to. The recent wave of outbreaks in Shanghai has repeatedly fluctuated, originating from Hong Kong and then spreading across the border into Shenzhen, and here in Shanghai was due to a surge of imported cases from Hong Kong. The official announcement stated that the spread of the epidemic was caused by inadequate protection measures at quarantine hotels, and the mutated virus had reduced its toxicity but increased its transmission speed through ventilation systems in hotels. Initially, it wasn’t very serious and could be contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are often confident. Shanghai&amp;rsquo;s leaders were like that too. They would choose to implement grid-based risk control with us for precise containment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lockdown-1&#34;&gt;Lockdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can all see from the results, the new cases have already exceeded 20,000, leaving us with no choice but to implement a lockdown. Notably, it didn’t use the word “lockdown” externally, as it had previously stated during a press conference that Shanghai did not need a lockdown, in order to preserve its last shred of face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grocery-shopping&#34;&gt;Grocery Shopping
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delivery industry is a new emerging sector driven by the internet. The core of it relies on someone delivering groceries for you, right? However, due to widespread lockdowns in many areas during the pandemic, merchants could operate but no one was available to deliver, which removed the final link in the chain. People outside of this may not fully understand – how could a cosmopolitan metropolis like Shanghai, with its residents going everywhere, all rush out to buy groceries together en masse? In reality, most people are also migrant workers who come here to work and live in rented apartments, typically eating at company canteens or restaurants, rarely cooking at home. When this route becomes blocked, those with the means will start buying groceries. Because this lockdown announcement was not made in advance, people didn&amp;rsquo;t have much food or vegetables stored up, which led to the chaotic rush to buy groceries seen in the video. In that situation, gathering together directly resulted in a resurgence of the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;industry&#34;&gt;Industry
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of us are working in the IT industry. I experienced the impact of the pandemic, getting a taste of remote work. Back in 2019, I stayed at home for almost a month, changing my train tickets back and forth ten times, with no certainty about when I would be able to return to Shenzhen.  I can’t even imagine how those people in the catering, tourism, or many service industries have been getting by these past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When you want to make money</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/when-you-want-to-make-money/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 03:23:53 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/when-you-want-to-make-money/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ordinary people are social animals, that’s right – you are an individual, and also a bipedal animal, with strong social attributes; you have feelings of inferiority and vanity, and society is constantly changing and eroding your &lt;strong&gt;everydayness&lt;/strong&gt;. We don&amp;rsquo;t discuss those great figures, those who willingly burn themselves for society or the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-current-situation&#34;&gt;My Current Situation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at average salaries or my hometown wages, my current income is significantly above the average – what’s there to be dissatisfied with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you earn one million, you start thinking about earning one hundred million; once you earn one hundred million, you start thinking about earning a billion. This is natural for ordinary people; we must face our inner selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-current-situation-1&#34;&gt;My Current Situation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s red are the more relaxed ways to make money: short videos. Everyone knows it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to enter an industry. What you see is short video content, but you don’t see the behind-the-scenes work of filming and copywriting. But everyone has their own dream – I’m suited for that industry, I was born to be in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting Started
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve watched so many videos. If you analyze a lot of the shots with your own mind, you can clearly see professional editing techniques and strong cinematic elements. Basically, some of them are from people who have formal training – film school graduates, for example. Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s also the logic of grassroots success, but that doesn’t apply to most people, does it?
On TikTok, you’ll also find many videos teaching you how to make videos. At this point, people are starting to wake up. If they could really make money, why would they teach others how to do it instead of doing it themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anti-human-recommendation-algorithms&#34;&gt;Anti-Human Recommendation Algorithms
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the Douyin algorithm would recommend movie clips and anime clips while I was scrolling – you’d start to find them interesting. However, when I looked into how Douyin makes money, it started recommending various tutorial videos non-stop, flooding my entire recommendation stream. As someone in the IT industry myself, I began to feel that the “big brothers” behind these algorithms were having a bit of a problem – you recommend like this, are you thinking I’m stupid or are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; stupid? Crucially, they keep finding new ways to recommend videos on how to make money with Douyin, covering different angles and various types. It&amp;rsquo;s as if they&amp;rsquo;re constantly trying to figure out the most effective way to exploit my time. I started wondering how long this business model could last, and how much time they could drain from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-clarity&#34;&gt;Finding Clarity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When teaching people how to do things, presenting a set of rules for them and then being unable to control yourself when doing it is ridiculous. As I’m not a purely technical blog writer, I haven&amp;rsquo;t published some things domestically, so here I casually rant. If one day I get banned, that can only be said to move somewhere else. I can’t say I haven’t done anything with Douyin – at least now it actively cooperates in the dissemination of real-time news and the propaganda of national policies, because in our country, you can&amp;rsquo;t defy the Communist Party, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now think back to when you were studying. When you truly can’t find the meaning of life, quietly reading a book is enough. In this era, how many people can still quiet their minds and quietly read books?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also want to thank the progress of science and technology. If you’re seeing this line, you’ll realize that the entire manuscript is very colloquial. And I really just kept writing and writing it. The input method I usually used was Sogou Input Method, which I&amp;rsquo;d been using for about seven or eight years. However, when it came to voice input, it had to be said that Xunfei was more professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the article number was changed to 002. Why did it have two zeros? There’s a dream – this year I wanted to break the hundred articles, which is just a dream, right? It&amp;rsquo;s not really articles; it’s more like records. I reflect on myself every day, and you must be able to think of some things, right?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adding a code copy button for seemingly simple things</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/add-copy-button-for-simple-task/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 01:23:39 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent four hours on this, and when I saw the sentence, it was hilarious. How could it have taken so long? Finally looked at the time: three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first draft of the year 2022, and it wasn’t complicated – exactly as the title said. (At that time, I was still quite young), I thought simply copying &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ouuan.github.io/post/from-hexo-to-hugo/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;作业&lt;/a&gt; would be enough, putting it in my favorites folder, and letting it sit for over a month before finally remembering the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When migrating to &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;, I always felt that the plugins were too few, couldn’t copy code, which made copying notes from Evernote to the blog very cumbersome, seriously hindering my motivation for writing a casual blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword&#34;&gt;Foreword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, carefully read the original author’s draft, read it through completely and flip through their introduction. Wow, I ran into a big shot – Tsinghua University undergraduate, has been exposed to computers since early on, huh? Just a facade, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at this blog first, completely forgot what he was supposed to do. Also, check out the author’s &lt;code&gt;Github&lt;/code&gt; repository; this modified ‘even’ theme is much prettier than now and has more features, let’s get started, merge the relevant code into it.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/add-copy-button-for-simple-task/2022-02-25-02-08-19.png&#34;
	width=&#34;215&#34;
	height=&#34;150&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;1&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;143&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;344px&#34;
	
&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/add-copy-button-for-simple-task/2022-02-25-02-08-40.png&#34;
	width=&#34;217&#34;
	height=&#34;167&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;1&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;129&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;311px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-features-view-article-history-associate-submission-records&#34;&gt;New Features: View Article History, Associate Submission Records
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect is still good, and you can experience it by dragging it to the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before taking action, I didn’t carefully examine the author&amp;rsquo;s original repository history, assuming a simple merge would fix everything.  Ultimately, I merged a huge amount of code with numerous conflicts and N times of manual overrides – all of which were frontend and rendering template code, using the one that matched my requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repository Address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TianlongXiang/hugo-theme-even&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/TianlongXiang/hugo-theme-even&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chinese pitfall: if &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t adjust this parameter, it will cause the generated link to not be able to obtain the current article&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;commit hash&lt;/code&gt;, resulting in history link generation failure.  When generating the complete historical record of the article, you also need to modify the automatic integration script and remember to pull the entire historical record of the current repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TianlongXiang/TianlongXiang.github.io/commit/0d860154de9b335ed88a57d62eedd4b6e3ccbeee&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;feat: Attempt to fetch the full GitHub repository to dynamically update the last modification record of the article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TianlongXiang/TianlongXiang.github.io/commit/1b5d719966737f16a8c67880370dc2722adea0b3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;chore: Path contains Chinese, hugo GitInfo needs to enable this setting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;name: Build Github
run: git config --global core.quotePath false &amp;amp;&amp;amp; hugo -b &amp;quot;https://www.xiangtianlong.com/&amp;quot; -d &amp;quot;github_public&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ls
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;style-adjustments&#34;&gt;Style Adjustments
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust website content width, the previous design was suitable for both mobile and desktop devices; in reality, no one actually viewed it on their phones, and I personally view it on my computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The directory bar should support automatic expansion/contraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;body&#34;&gt;Body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referenced &lt;code&gt;ouuan&lt;/code&gt;’s code records for half an hour or so, and still couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite understand how to increase the copy button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time travel, a month later, it came back to this matter again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I didn’t understand this assignment, I switched to copying from another source – it was definitely easier to grasp. The results of my search were surprisingly helpful; a forum post on the official &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; website detailed how to add a copy button. After checking it out, I realized that the code block styles generated by &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; differed from the descriptions in the documentation – this part was quite complicated. So, I’m just going to record this for reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand front-end development, when I encounter something I don’t get, I open my browser’s “Inspect” tool and analyze the code alongside the style information on the right; I use JavaScript logs to help me understand the logic. There were many things I didn’t understand at first. Taking a deep breath and carefully breaking down the logic helped me find a solution eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; nodes are multiple, this refers to a single code block. The theme itself rendered line numbers, which resulted in the copy button appearing twice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to disable the theme’s built-in code highlighting; unfortunately, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the settings for this theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I consulted the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; website and read some documentation – it was a bit confusing at first, but I learned that the &lt;code&gt;markup&lt;/code&gt; setting could control code highlighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I adjusted the configuration file, but it didn’t work; the rendered output differed from my expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I discovered this bunch of settings called &lt;code&gt;pygmentsOptions&lt;/code&gt;, so I continued to consult documentation and adjust the settings, first removing the line numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I configured a custom CSS stylesheet and a custom JavaScript script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since I’d already done so much, my brain suddenly remembered seeing a nice color palette recently, so I modified the button styles: Let&amp;rsquo;s go with the traditional Chinese sky blue!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;special-img-class&#34; style=&#34;width:20%&#34; src=&#34;2022-02-25-02-01-22.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;special-img-class&#34; style=&#34;width:20%&#34; src=&#34;2022-02-25-02-01-33.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent four hours on this, and when I saw that sentence, I even found it funny – how could it take so long? Finally, I looked at the time: It was only three hours.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What we have been seeking throughout our lives is…</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/what-we-seek-throughout-life/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 21:09:58 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/what-we-seek-throughout-life/</guid>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang Yi-zi said: Human relationships, spanning a lifetime of mutual support and dependence, may be held within one’s embrace, understood in the confines of one room; or they may arise from entrusted messages, dissolving into the vastness beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a lifetime, like a fleeting flower. Like grass and trees blossoming and withering, like the rising and setting of the sun and moon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, in this life, desires are numerous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a child, I lay under lotus plants and hemp in the stream, busy catching the east wind to fly kites, chasing yellow butterflies in haste,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also learned to grow gourds by the shade of mulberry trees, returning home with a full meal after dusk, not shedding my cloak to lie beneath the moonlight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I grew older, I hoped to be inscribed on the gold list, to have a beautiful woman accompany me, to have endless wealth, to rise continuously, to have a full table of guests, to sing and play every night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When old, I wanted health and longevity, welcome childhood servants, young children waiting at the door, a chessboard, a confidant, a bottle of wine, a courtyard, enjoying family harmony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see people rushing about in a panic, only seeking a few taels of broken silver. Yet, this broken silver, can it dispel all kinds of melancholy in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Half the people are still struggling with their lives, where do they have time to seek meaning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, human life is just an experience, like plants, sun and moon – experiencing the cycle of desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t understand it, you’ll feel like a fleeting moment in the vastness of the world, a tiny grain of sand on the Yangtze River. When you understand it, you’re happy with what you encounter, temporarily possessing yourself, content and self-sufficient, unaware of your approaching old age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can pursue wealth and fame, or poetry, wine, flowers, and tea. You can pursue the clear breeze on the river or the bright moon in the mountains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But don’t overly concern yourself with the results; they will all eventually pass away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a lifetime of hardship, when you arrive in this world, try to experience the joys and sorrows, birth, old age, sickness, and death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really like the quote from The Tale of the Sea Deer:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lives are short, and we will eventually lose them, so why not be a little bolder – love someone, climb a mountain, chase a dream – there are many things with no answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I greatly enjoyed &lt;em&gt;The Analects of Zan Gong&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Red Cliff&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the rise of past generations, one feels a sense of longing; if only they could be brought together as one, never to have lamented or mourned, unable to convey it within my heart. I know that dying in one’s lifetime is an absurdity, and the tragedy of Zang and Peng is a false fabrication. Those who look upon us now are like we look upon them then. Alas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some stock ticker symbols contain periods or other special characters in their names. When submitting these to Interactive Brokers (IB) via &lt;code&gt;Fix&lt;/code&gt;, certain transformations of the stock code name are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRK/B -&amp;gt; BRK B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;body&#34;&gt;Body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Fidelity Securities case, it’s possible to analyze and implement the conversion rules are fixed through coding. When the rules are not fixed, generally the system needs to store the corresponding mapping relationships, which are updated periodically by business operations personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lost/Confused</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/lost-and-confused/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 18:01:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/lost-and-confused/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, at some stage of life, people find themselves in a state of confusion, not knowing what they truly want, and gradually losing their pursuit of the meaning of work amidst the mundane daily routines. Looking back to when I first graduated, my heart was full of fervent aspirations – then I would without hesitation say, “I yearn to write code, to create brilliant, eye-catching code.” However, working until today, I’ve had more exposure to business-level affairs, which is largely due to the benefits brought by industry development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of my lifestyle, I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet included marriage and having children, or establishing a family, in my thinking; my mind is almost blank, only focused on enjoying the present moment. Whenever weekends arrive, I enjoy quietly playing games, often spending an entire day staying at home, immersed in my own little world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life, we always need something we truly love and dedicate ourselves to wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buying-a-house&#34;&gt;Buying a House
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I was full of enthusiasm and planned to save diligently to buy my own property. I meticulously budgeted every day towards this goal. However, as house prices continued to rise, I transitioned from initial anxiety and disappointment to eventually becoming numb, gradually feeling that even if I bought a house, it would simply be a heavy burden I’d been carrying around – ultimately leading me to abandon the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;saving-money&#34;&gt;Saving Money
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, saving money was about achieving some small goals, such as building a high-performance desktop computer, purchasing a long-desired camera, or taking an impromptu trip. However, now I approach saving with a more relaxed and “chill” attitude, no longer worrying too much about daily expenses – I indulge in things I want to eat and boldly try new and exciting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;returning-home&#34;&gt;Returning Home
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I realized that what I most longed for deep down was simply to go home. There wasn’t anything particularly to do, just returning to that familiar place, feeling the warmth and tranquility of home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Hong Kong Futures Basic Concepts</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-futures-basics/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 10:54:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-futures-basics/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As financial markets continue to evolve, investors have begun seeking more effective investment tools to enhance their investment returns. To meet investor demand, The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has launched a range of stock futures contracts, all of which represent stocks listed on its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), which boasts high trading volumes and active liquidity. Through investing in stock futures, investors can participate in the performance of individual companies while also benefiting from the short selling and leverage effects offered by the derivatives market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the underlying stocks represented by stock futures are typically leading companies within their respective industries, investors can strategically select to invest in those industry-specific futures if they believe a particular sector’s performance will outperform or underperform the overall stock market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-definition&#34;&gt;Basic Definition
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stock futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specified quantity of financial value (contract size) equivalent to a specified number of shares (the underlying stock) at a predetermined price (the agreed-upon price) on a future, specified date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All stock futures contracts are settled in cash and do not involve the physical delivery of shares upon expiration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contract-expiry&#34;&gt;Contract Expiry
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon contract expiry, the profit or loss amount is calculated as the difference between the agreed-upon price and the final settlement price multiplied by the contract multiplier, which will be deducted from the clearing member’s margin account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final settlement price refers to the official closing price of the stock reported by the Shanghai Stock Exchange on the last trading day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a futures investor wishes to close out their position before expiry, a short seller only needs to buy back one futures contract, while a long position holder must sell one futures contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;margin-deposit&#34;&gt;Margin Deposit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In futures trading, both buyers and sellers must initially deposit a basic margin as collateral to fulfill the contract. After each daily settlement, the clearing organization calculates profits or losses for all open contracts based on the closing market price and uses this to deduct from investors’ margin accounts. If unfavorable market conditions result in an investor incurring losses that cause their margin to fall below the specified level, the exchange will require the investor to top up their margin within a designated timeframe to maintain it at the original basic margin level (i.e., to cover).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advantages&#34;&gt;Advantages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Transaction Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; The fees are low relative to the value of the underlying shares. Each futures contract is equivalent to thousands of shares, and commissions depend on the number of contracts traded, resulting in a very low cost per unit of value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier Short Selling:&lt;/strong&gt; Because investors can easily short stocks through futures contracts, they can profit during market declines by shorting stock futures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Maker System:&lt;/strong&gt; To ensure market liquidity, The Hong Kong Exchange &amp;amp; Clearing Limited (HKEX) mandates that market makers provide buy and sell prices within a specified range, maintaining circulation in the stock futures market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Investors only need to pay a margin representing a small portion of the contract value when buying and selling stock futures contracts, making hedging and trading more cost-effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Foreign Investor Currency Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Stock futures contracts provide foreign investors with access to invest in high-quality local stocks because they only pay a margin instead of the full contract value, significantly reducing the currency risk borne by foreign investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Trading System:&lt;/strong&gt; Stock futures contracts are traded through The Hong Kong Exchange &amp;amp; Clearing Limited’s (HKEX) electronic trading system. All trades are executed according to price and time priority, with immediate display of buy prices, sell prices, and transaction prices, achieving the highest level of market transparency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clearing Company Performance Guarantees:&lt;/strong&gt; Stock futures contracts will be registered, settled, and performance guarantees provided by HKEX’s wholly owned subsidiary, Hong Kong Futures Clearing Limited (the Clearing Company). Because the Clearing Company is the counterparty to all unsettled contracts, participants in the clearing house will not have to bear counterparty risk. However, this guarantee does not include the financial responsibility of the clearing participant for its clients; investors choosing a broker to trade must exercise caution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;market-making&#34;&gt;Market Making
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market participants or individual stock futures contracts may register as market makers on the exchange and simultaneously provide both buy and sell prices within the specified maximum spread. Exchange participants and their clients should be aware that individual stock futures contracts may not have a market maker registered to provide bid-ask spreads, and their trades will be based on market unit pricing. &lt;strong&gt;Investors should note that stock futures without registered market makers may involve liquidity risk, and caution should be exercised before entering the market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;risks-of-trading-stock-futures&#34;&gt;Risks of Trading Stock Futures
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock futures involve high risks. Losses arising from trading stock futures may exceed the initial margin paid, potentially requiring you to pay additional margins within a short period. If unable to meet these payments, your position may be liquidated, and you will bear all resulting losses. Therefore, it is crucial to fully understand the risks associated with trading stock futures and assess whether it’s suitable for you. Before engaging in transactions, consult with a broker or financial advisor to determine if futures and options contracts are appropriate based on your financial situation and investment objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a listed company alters its capital structure through measures such as a cash offer or the issuance of bonus shares, this will lead to changes in share prices at the time of net asset valuation or the effective date, and may also affect uncovered positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If other circumstances remain unchanged, the value of holdings held by shareholders will not be adjusted on the settlement day; however, this is different for buyers or holders of stock futures. Unless the futures contract is appropriately adjusted, changes to the share price will unfairly and unjustly impact the value of a stock futures position. The adjustment ratio determined by the Settlement Corporation is based on maintaining the fair value of the futures contract and only made when there are significant changes. The Hong Kong Exchange will announce the details of the adjustments, and participants in the exchange must inform customers about the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Capital Monopoly and the Demise of the Online Education Industry</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:59:08 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent two trading days have seen a significant downturn in the stock market, exposing newcomers to the risks of the market. China is about to enter an aging demographic phase, and birth rates are dismal, with the decline exceeding the estimates of relevant experts, hindering industries that obstruct declining birth rates; the Party will take decisive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-student-burden&#34;&gt;Reducing Student Burden
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of us born in the 1990s didn’t have as many interest classes or tutoring sessions; after school, we would run wild playing. This was first due to the limitations of our families&amp;rsquo; conditions and second because tutoring centers hadn’t yet established a brand effect, convincing parents to trust them. Twenty years have passed in a flash, and since 2019, the capitalization of K12 education has seen the rise of online tutoring companies like猿辅导 (Yuancu Tu), bolstered by capital, which have created various high-end tutoring centers by concentrating excellent resources. Despite exorbitant fees, parental enthusiasm remains unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of urbanization, many parents see education as a path to escape the constraints of the peasantry and achieve a social class leap. As cogs in the machine themselves, they don’t have much time to care for their children, not only because they are highly competitive but also because they don&amp;rsquo;t want their children to fall behind their peers. “It’s difficult for nobles to become commoners,” and with ordinary education levels, it is hard for families in China to maintain their current social standing or make another class leap. If they enter vocational high schools, in today’s society, they believe this represents a downward slide in social status, which is something most parents cannot accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-student-burden-1&#34;&gt;Reducing Student Burden
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit the reasons behind extracurricular tutoring and why parents seek it out. Textbook knowledge and example problems are straightforward – many students can understand them easily. However, many subjects cover broad concepts superficially without delving deeply. The talent selection mechanism requires differentiation, leading to a contradiction: exam questions based solely on textbook knowledge cannot effectively filter candidates. This necessitates horizontal and vertical expansion of learning. These areas are aspects that teachers simply cannot cover in the classroom, creating the fertile ground for extracurricular tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document contains numerous clauses and specifications, outlining multiple aspects and providing a summary of the guiding document’s outline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely reduce the total amount and duration of homework assignments to alleviate students&amp;rsquo; excessive workload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the level of after-school services offered by schools to meet diverse student needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strictly govern extracurricular training activities and comprehensively standardize their behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significantly enhance teaching and learning quality to ensure that students master what they learn at school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen supporting governance and improve support capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully organize and implement it, aiming for tangible results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;elite-education&#34;&gt;Elite Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a phenomenon in the education sector – the increasing prevalence of powerful private schools. Public schools are struggling to provide sufficient high-quality resources (leading to enclaves/gated communities). Various sized educational groups are attracting excellent teachers with high salaries, establishing quality learning environments, and gradually building their own brands, most notably: &lt;strong&gt;Hen Shuai Model&lt;/strong&gt;. Old Home Corporation averages over 3000 RMB, powerful private primary schools charge between 9000 and 10000 RMB per year. Educational groups form a virtuous cycle – my tuition is expensive, but the teachers are excellent, students achieve good grades, I raise tuition fees, and parents will still send their children here. Public resources (teachers) are gradually being drawn to private schools, ultimately becoming synonymous with substandard education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;algorithmic-optimization&#34;&gt;Algorithmic Optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is data showing that Meituan’s contracted delivery riders have approached 4 million, with approximately 400,000 active riders. Many people rely on this job to support their families and livelihoods. The relentless algorithmic pressure to minimize delivery times reduces individuals into measurable units, feeding them into algorithms for constant calculation, continually exploring the boundaries of delivery rider collapse. Believing themselves clever, &lt;strong&gt;they violate human nature and serve capital.&lt;/strong&gt; The market operates here, allowing everyone to play and enjoy sustainable play, rather than &lt;strong&gt;monopolizing, wielding privileges, the gameplay of capitalism, a reckless and brutal growth that will ultimately come to an end&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility&#34;&gt;Stock Market Volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 2021, education stocks represented by New Oriental performed a dramatic plunge, followed by Hao Pai Futures in the pre-market session. &lt;strong&gt;Stock prices plummeted by half.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has gradually entered an aging population, and various social phenomena affecting family planning must be rectified; monopolistic and overtime internet companies were fined, and the capital-concentrated education industry was also scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility-1&#34;&gt;Stock Market Volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The education industry is not allowed to be capitalized on; a single vote directly negated related industries&amp;rsquo; IPO financing, and there was wailing everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A pattern of disruption to test system stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The domestic internet industry is always fond of playing with new things, often introducing terms that most people wouldn’t be able to guess what they are.
After reading some articles, this definition specifically for the early stages of Chaos Engineering is relatively easy to accept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early exploration of Chaos Engineering has actually been ongoing within the industry, previously existing under the guise of fault testing and disaster recovery exercises. As microservice architectures continue to develop and distributed systems grow ever larger, Chaos Engineering has begun to emerge and gain increasing importance. Following Netflix’s formal proposal of the Chaos Engineering concept, related theories have also rapidly enriched. Netflix&amp;rsquo;s practices have also demonstrated the significant impact Chaos Engineering has on stability.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kubernetes paused pod</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/kubernetes-pause-pod/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 11:23:09 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/kubernetes-pause-pod/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Deployment controllers implement a crucial function within a Kubernetes cluster: the ability to horizontally scale and shrink Pods. This capability was essential for traditional cloud-era platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encountering a business scenario where you need to modify data in a database, restarting Pod nodes after adjustments. However, during Pod operation, table fields are continuously modified, requiring temporary pausing of application updates to tables, adjusting the data, and then restoring the Pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides abruptly deleting the Deployment, are there other ways to achieve a similar pause effect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;kubectl scale --replicas=0 deployment/&amp;lt;your-deployment&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before seeing the answer, many people might have thought that simply operating processes was the way to go, stuck in the mindset of directly manipulating business processes instead of realizing the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fixed Income Funds / Bond Funds</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/funds-and-fixed-income-wealth-management/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 11:27:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/funds-and-fixed-income-wealth-management/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Those of us born in the 90s, we didn’t really feel the impact of the 2008 financial crisis – after all, we were young and hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet started to focus on finance. The roaring bull market of 2015 came with a lot of fanfare, and when it ended, it made quite a stir, ultimately requiring government intervention to stabilize the markets. Simultaneously, this brought the concept of “funds” into the view of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ant-financial-and-alipay&#34;&gt;Ant Financial and Alipay
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a natural traffic entry for Ant Financial, Alipay was born with the positioning of a payment tool. When purchasing funds, Alipay and WeChat both saw widespread adoption – most people chose Alipay. Alipay has successfully transformed fund sales into an ordinary shopping experience. Starting in 2019, during the small bull market, fund managers’ “warming up” recruitment, ultimately driven by the monetary easing guided by the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who entered made a profit, those who didn&amp;rsquo;t enter envied them and rushed to join. The scale of new funds broke through the hundred billion mark at an increasingly rapid pace, and with grandmothers starting to buy funds, another trillion fund is not far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Alipay’s explosive rise as a code-driven internet fund sales platform, ordinary people&amp;rsquo;s contact with fund sales was primarily when depositing money in banks, where the branch manager would enthusiastically introduce various investment products. The internet packaging and promotional page information guidance, the exorbitant advertising fees given by fund sales institutions, completely detached Alipay’s fund advertisements from rationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal bank fixed-term investment returns are 4%, P2P investments that played wildly in recent years were 8%, credit card repayment interest rates are 12%. Our protagonist, Alipay&amp;rsquo;s promoted funds – 150% and 250% – were popular in the market, making everyone happy, both inside and outside the market? Alipay was playing with fire.&lt;/strong&gt; The advertised returns only showed the three-year cumulative yield chart, while traditional fund companies only presented annualized average yields. Why didn’t they dare to present the annual average yield alone? Because it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t look good, and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t guide customers to purchase funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fixed-income-investment&#34;&gt;Fixed Income Investment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;China hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet entered a negative interest rate era, making bank deposits and government bonds the most secure fixed-income products. Pure credit funds are also a good option. You can refer to the data published by local statistical bureaus to find China’s average wage levels. I’ll present a simple scenario: with an asset size of 2 million (CNY), an annualized yield of 4%, the annual income will exceed most cities&amp;rsquo; average wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is largely based on my personal experiences, and there’s much more I could write. If you want to learn more, I recommend reading a variety of economic books yourself – don&amp;rsquo;t blindly follow. For ordinary families, the core of financial planning is preservation, not chasing risky dreams of getting rich quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle often says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right thing at the right time has the greatest value; study diligently when you’re studying, and getting a good degree is better than earning pocket money by distributing flyers; work seriously when you first graduate, and the growth in your salary will bring you substantial returns; and when you start a family, learn to take care of your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue-1&#34;&gt;Epilogue

        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 09:26:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/docker-two-three-things/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having worked with CentOS for many years, content may not apply to macOS or Ubuntu users in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can refer to the documentation from Tsinghua University for installation guidance: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/docker-ce/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/docker-ce/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to unknown mysterious forces, domestic Docker installation is recommended to set the cloud vendor&amp;rsquo;s repository address. Here we recommend using &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;set-repository-source-address&#34;&gt;Set Repository Source Address
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;yum install yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo http://mirrors.aliyun.com/docker-ce/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deploy-the-latest-version&#34;&gt;Deploy the Latest Version
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Docker is a commonly used background service, we recommend setting it to start on boot. The following command applies to CentOS 7:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo yum install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io &amp;amp;&amp;amp; systemctl enable --now docker
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deploying-a-specific-version&#34;&gt;Deploying a Specific Version
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The releases of &lt;code&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; are not fully synchronized. If you need to deploy &lt;code&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; subsequently, refer to the &lt;code&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; deployment instructions and install a specific version of &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;yum list docker-ce --showduplicates | sort -r
sudo yum install -y docker-ce-18.09.2-3.el7 docker-ce-cli-18.09.2-3.el7 containerd.io-18.09.2-3.el7 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; systemctl enable --now docker
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adding-docker-permissions-for-regular-users&#34;&gt;Adding Docker Permissions for Regular Users
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;uninstall&#34;&gt;Uninstall
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo yum erase -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;everyday-use&#34;&gt;Everyday Use
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;mirror-acceleration&#34;&gt;Mirror Acceleration
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s still an unknown mysterious force that causes slow image pulls. At this time, domestic cloud vendors have emerged and provided many acceleration services, which are still recommended – &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acceleration addresses can be managed by you registering an Alibaba Cloud account; this service is free. Alibaba Cloud also offers a free image build service.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linux Setup JMeter Test Environment</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-setup-jmeter-testing-environment/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 10:12:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-setup-jmeter-testing-environment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The author has a strong interest in hardware and used JMeter to conduct load testing, documenting the process of deploying JMeter, InfluxDB, and Grafana on CentOS 7. They shared installation and command usage for JMeter, InfluxDB’s features and Docker installation method, as well as a simple deployment and configuration for Grafana. They summarized experience and references related to high-performance programming patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As widely known, I have a very strong interest in hardware. By chance, the test team was using &lt;code&gt;JMeter&lt;/code&gt; to perform load tests and discovered that performance wasn&amp;rsquo;t improving. As a curious individual, I decisively took action to see how the company conducted its testing. There’s also a small story: at some point in the distant past, I read a post on OpenChina about how to create more impressive-looking performance test graphs – after observing &lt;code&gt;Windows&lt;/code&gt; versions execute tests and achieving visualized &lt;code&gt;TPS&lt;/code&gt; data display, what&amp;rsquo;s the use of configuring a web panel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking is all well and good, but you have to try it yourself to understand.
Don’t use GUI mode for load testing! only for Test creation and Test debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-1&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officially, it’s recommended to obtain test reports via the command line and display them using a GUI, which introduces data errors.  I don&amp;rsquo;t have deep knowledge of JMeter – at least I found a reason to tinker with a &lt;code&gt;Linux&lt;/code&gt; version console panel. The openchinese post’s core component deployment isn’t friendly; you need to follow their WeChat channel to download the required files, so as a young millennial, of course I used &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt; instead. Basically, my server is located domestically, and accessing the overseas source addresses is very slow – at least using an image service, Alibaba Cloud has a free acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; installation and deployment, this will not be elaborated on here; please refer to previous articles for recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following content focuses on two main areas: setting up the basic test environment components and a simple explanation of each component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jmeter&#34;&gt;JMeter
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apache JMeter is a Java-based load testing tool developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It’s used to perform stress tests on software, initially designed for web application testing but later expanded to other testing domains. It can be used to test static and dynamic resources, such as static files, Java microservices, CGI scripts, Java objects, databases, FTP servers, etc. JMeter can simulate massive loads from various stress categories to test the strength of servers, networks, or objects and analyze overall performance. Furthermore, JMeter can perform functional/regression testing on applications by creating scripts with assertions to verify that your program returns the expected results. To maximize flexibility, JMeter allows using regular expressions to create assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache jmeter can be used to perform performance tests on static and dynamic resources (files, Servlets, Perl scripts, Java objects, databases and queries, FTP servers, etc.). It can be used to simulate heavy loads on servers, networks, or objects to test their strength or analyze overall performance under different stress types. You can use it for performance graphing or large concurrent load testing of your server/script/object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-deployment-on-centos7&#34;&gt;Jmeter Deployment on CentOS7
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;code&gt;JDK&lt;/code&gt; runtime environment, download the &lt;code&gt;Jmeter&lt;/code&gt; installation package:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
wget https://mirrors.bfsu.edu.cn/apache//jmeter/binaries/apache-jmeter-5.4.tgz &amp;amp;&amp;amp; tar -xf apache-jmeter-5.4.tgz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configure environment variables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;export JMETER_HOME=$HOME/jmeter/apache-jmeter-5.4
export PATH=$JMETER_HOME/bin:$PATH
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-commands&#34;&gt;JMeter Commands
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it will be connected to the &lt;code&gt;Grafana&lt;/code&gt; dashboard, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to input the &lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt; parameter to observe data in the &lt;code&gt;web&lt;/code&gt; console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;jmeter -n -t /tmp/order-500-10s.jmx -l /tmp/jmeter-order-report-20200109/order-500-10s.jtl
# Generally, don&#39;t use test results and test reports to simplify the command
jmeter -n -t /tmp/order-500-10s.jmx
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;influxdb&#34;&gt;InfluxDB
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfluxDB is an open-source distributed time series database written in Go. It requires no external dependencies. The database is now primarily used for storing large volumes of timestamped data such as DevOps monitoring data, app metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influxdb-features&#34;&gt;InfluxDB Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfluxDB’s features can be summarized into the following 9 aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schema-less (Schemaless):&lt;/strong&gt; Can contain an arbitrary number of columns;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metric Retention Time Setting:&lt;/strong&gt;  Allows setting the retention time for metrics;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Time-Related Functions:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports functions related to time (such as min, max, sum, count, mean, median, etc.) for convenient statistical analysis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage Policy Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Can be used for data deletion and modification (InfluxDB does not provide methods for deleting or modifying data);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Query Support:&lt;/strong&gt;  Automatically scheduled sets of statements that run within the database, combined with storage policies to reduce InfluxDB’s system footprint;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native HTTP Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Built-in HTTP API;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Similar SQL Syntax:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports a syntax similar to SQL;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Setting Data Replica Count in Clusters:&lt;/strong&gt; Allows setting the number of replicas for data within clusters;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Periodic Sampling of Data:&lt;/strong&gt;  Writes data to another measurement, facilitating granular data storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influxdb-docker-installation&#34;&gt;InfluxDB Docker Installation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;mkdir influxdb &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd influxdb &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
docker run -p 8086:8086 -d --name influxdb -v $PWD:/var/lib/influxdb influxdb:1.7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker exec -it influxdb /bin/bash&lt;/code&gt; enters the container, executes commands, and manually creates a database&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;root@bce0a55bbc72:/# influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.7.10
InfluxDB shell version: 1.7.10
&amp;gt; Execute commands in the interactive shell
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influxdb-database-and-user-creation&#34;&gt;InfluxDB Database and User Creation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create database: &lt;code&gt;create database jmeter_t2&lt;/code&gt;
View databases: &lt;code&gt;show databases&lt;/code&gt;
Switch to database: &lt;code&gt;use jmeter_t2&lt;/code&gt;
Create user: &lt;code&gt;create user &amp;quot;admin&amp;quot; with password &#39;admin&#39; with all privileges&lt;/code&gt;
View users: &lt;code&gt;show users&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; show users
user  admin
----  -----
admin true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the user permissions for &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; are displayed as &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, the database setup is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grafana&#34;&gt;Grafana
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing test cases, it was found that the chart visualization effect is not very necessary; the &lt;code&gt;tps&lt;/code&gt; data from the interface can be observed when executed in the command line, and more importantly, we wanted to know the internal timing of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple deployment of the &lt;code&gt;grafana&lt;/code&gt; console panel, importing a configuration file to connect with &lt;code&gt;InfluxDB&lt;/code&gt;, was performed. The console supports filtering test results through tags; generally, only one &lt;code&gt;InfluxDB&lt;/code&gt; database needs to be configured:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;High-performance program patterns invariably are one-loop thread; any locks, enqueueing, and dequeueing will cause unnecessary performance loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time spent on core business logic is greater than the time spent introducing other code, concurrency can effectively improve efficiency; if the core latency is sufficient, be cautious about introducing other code.&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Production environment operating systems, with Red Hat and CentOS being the mainstream choices. The documentation includes links to two system lifecycles and shares experience upgrading from CentOS 8 to CentOS Stream 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current domestic environment, Red Hat and CentOS are the mainstream choices for production environments. After experiencing the retirement of Red Hat 6 two years ago, this record includes the official website links for the lifecycles of both systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-content&#34;&gt;Main Content
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wiki.centos.org/zh/About/Product&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CentOS Product Specifications&lt;/a&gt;
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS are the mainstream choices for enterprise servers. RHEL provides stable support and update cycles, suitable for enterprise applications. CentOS as RHEL&amp;rsquo;s community edition, offers similar functionality and stability but without official support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;follow-up&#34;&gt;Follow-up
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When publishing this article, I didn’t expect to update it two years later. Just a few days ago, I upgraded my daily virtual machine from CentOS 8 to CentOS 8 Stream. I can&amp;rsquo;t say much about what to choose in production – I prefer to keep the latest version in my local environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentOS 8 Stream is a rolling release version that offers faster updates and new features than traditional CentOS, making it suitable for development and testing environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>US-China Trade War</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with some tangential points, the differences between Chinese-style socialism and capitalism. From the mouths of the older generation, we heard that to get rich, you first needed to build roads. China&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure construction – these things are all funded by the state, and in a capitalist society, they would be contracted out. In remote areas, there’s no profit motive, so companies wouldn’t willingly take on those projects. Talking too much is getting off-topic, and ordinary people might feel that trade wars don&amp;rsquo;t have much impact on their lives. However, China’s high-end manufacturing has always been relatively weak. The IT industry I work in – memory, hard drives, CPUs, graphics cards – the core configuration of assembling a computer comes from factories abroad. These components account for 50% of the total cost, and high-end manufacturing is undoubtedly essential. The collision between China and the United States is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Made in China 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;2018-2020 China–United States trade war (often referred to as the “China–United States trade war,” “US–China trade dispute,” “US–China trade friction,” or “US-China trade war”) was a trade war between the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade dispute originated when U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on March 22, 2018, claiming that &amp;ldquo;China is stealing US intellectual property and trade secrets,&amp;rdquo; and under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, imposing tariffs on goods imported from China totaling an estimated $600 billion. On July 6, 2018, the U.S. imposed additional tariffs of 25% on $340 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the United States. The Ministry of Commerce of China retaliated in kind with a 25% additional tariff on $340 billion worth of U.S. goods exported to China, including soybeans, the largest export product from the United States to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides had temporarily reached an agreement to pause the trade war in May 2018 and issued a joint statement seeking reconciliation. However, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative subsequently released its first list of tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the United States on June 16, raising the existing 10% tariff to 25%. The China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) then retaliated with equivalent measures, and the Ministry of Commerce of China also restarted anti-dumping investigations into various U.S. products exported to China. On July 6, the Trump administration formally implemented tariffs on the first list of $340 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the United States, marking the formal implementation of Trump’s trade policy towards China (the remaining $160 billion was subsequently added with a 25% tariff on August 23). The Ministry of Commerce of China stated afterward that &amp;ldquo;The United States violated WTO rules and launched the largest trade war in economic history.&amp;rdquo; The General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) indicated that China’s counter-measures were implemented immediately after the U.S. imposed tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 1, at the G20 Buenos Aires Summit, leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump agreed to hold a nine-month negotiation and suspend new trade measures during the negotiation period. After the deadline of March 1, 2019, the U.S. side announced significant progress and extended the suspension of new trade measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs of 25% on approximately $200 billion, totaling $250 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the United States, which took effect on June 1. On May 13, the China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) announced that tariffs on $600 billion worth of imported U.S. products would be raised to a range of 5% to 25%, starting from June 1. On June 1, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced that the implementation date for tariffs of 25% on U.S. goods would be postponed to June 15, and SAFE stated that China’s tariff measures took effect as scheduled on June 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 29, leaders Xi Jinping and Trump held a meeting at the G20 Osaka Summit, agreeing to restart economic consultations, with the United States ceasing to impose new tariffs on Chinese products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 1, due to concerns about China’s purchasing process of U.S. agricultural products, Trump announced on Twitter that tariffs of 10% would be imposed on the remaining $300 billion worth of all Chinese goods shipped to the United States starting September 1, 2019. On August 5, the Renminbi exchange rate against the US dollar fell below 7 yuan. The same day, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that China was designated as a currency manipulator. Subsequently, the Chinese government announced a suspension of purchases of U.S. agricultural products and announced tariffs of 10% or 5% on approximately $750 billion worth of U.S. goods, and resumed tariffs on U.S. automobiles and parts, while the U.S. side responded by increasing the tariff rates on its existing $300 billion Chinese goods to 15%, and its current $250 billion Chinese goods to 25% as retaliation, but these measures were subsequently shelved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building PCs</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/computer-assembly/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 14:33:46 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/computer-assembly/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The author has long had an interest in building computers from a young age, and began to delve into hardware assembly after university. They recommended websites for comparing hardware performance and offered purchasing suggestions, including CPU, solid-state drives, hard disk drives, and memory frequencies. They also shared their experience and advice regarding hardware selection and important considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wonder--unspeakable&#34;&gt;Wonder – Unspeakable
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was young, I’ve dreamed of building my own computer, but unfortunately, economic conditions didn&amp;rsquo;t allow it. Finally, after a lot of hard work, I reached university and built a laptop for portability. If I had to pinpoint a specific time when the idea started, it would be when I first began thinking about assembling computers at my hometown’s library. After all, it was a sizable city-level library, with not only an electronic reading room (though I never actually used it – it was billed by the hour) but also a magazine reading room, where I discovered magazines like &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Computer News&lt;/em&gt;. For someone who had limited exposure to computers, these were practically divine科普资料 (scientific popularization materials). When I read about players “doing dungeons” and “killing monsters,” I thought about building my own computer to do the same, acting as the main output. And when I saw “black technology,” I fantasized about replicating what was described in the books, hoping to achieve similar effects (regarding the use of hacking tools).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I had a heavy workload in high school, with my limited understanding at the time, reading and playing were both important. It could be said that we lived a &amp;ldquo;naive and carefree&amp;rdquo; life, using the excuse of going to the library to read as an alibi, and I would often carry a small bag and walk there. The city wasn&amp;rsquo;t that big, so it was generally a walk. Arriving at the library, I enjoyed the air conditioning, reading novels, comics, and game magazines, occasionally even delving into more serious books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy for older people to forget things, and this is where the library sparked the initial seed. When I was in junior high school, relatives had assembled a computer, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it was used for back then. The operating system was Windows 2003, and there were built-in games like &lt;em&gt;Paper Cards&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;Empire&lt;/em&gt;. We all thought about “outsmarting” each other to steal keys, playing games together with my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I entered junior high school, the school offered basic computer training, and later I transitioned to a computer competition concept. I even qualified for NOIP (National Olympiad in Informatics) once. Speaking of this, it’s worth mentioning the power of our alumni. The high school&amp;rsquo;s computer building was donated by alumni, including a computer teaching room + library. At that time, it was also the initial wave of China’s internet boom. School leaders supported participation in computer competitions, as several senior classmates had been admitted to key universities through computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never reflected on my relationship with computers like this way. It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder that after graduating, I stubbornly switched from automation to computer science – the seed had already been planted, and those within the circle didn’t realize it. Having encountered more things from a young age, I thought I was very skilled, but in reality, I only understood the surface level. My biggest advantage was the initial passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hardware-assembly&#34;&gt;Hardware Assembly
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browse through stores like Carda, Chiphell, and Zhihu’s computer assembly forums – newcomers can relatively easily put together a list of the components they need. After 2019, when purchasing CPUs with limited financial resources, prioritize AMD for higher performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend a commonly used hardware performance comparison website: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/&lt;/a&gt;.  You can compare prices with US-imported parts on Xianyu (a Chinese online marketplace). True experts can find great deals by buying secondhand on Xianyu – it’s significantly cheaper. If you&amp;rsquo;re not very familiar, I don’t recommend buying from Xianyu; I purchased fake memory myself, and while it hasn’t caused any problems so far, I’m not entirely sure about its reliability – the model and specifications don’t match at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sn550-vs-sn750&#34;&gt;SN550 VS SN750
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between the SN550 1TB and the SN750 1TB is that they consistently read and write slower by a factor of two – one reads at 850MB, while the other reads at 1.6GB. However, for everyday use, there’s no noticeable difference because both support 4K equally. Of course, this refers to the 1TB SN550; speeds are significantly slower in sequential read/write operations with the 500G and 250G versions. In my opinion, if you&amp;rsquo;re not a spendthrift, buying the SN550 is sufficient – my main reason for not purchasing it wasn’t its sequential read/write speed, but rather that it only comes in a 1TB capacity, while the SN750 offers 2TB. For me, given the circumstances and without needing to expand further, my motherboard&amp;rsquo;s M.2 NVMe interface is more valuable than these SSD differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a consensus of online user feedback, purchasing an adapter board – a B150 motherboard can also support M.2 interfaces for SSDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hard-disk-drive-selection&#34;&gt;Hard Disk Drive Selection
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the prices of hard disk drives are relatively stable. For users with large storage needs, it is necessary to select a suitable mechanical hard drive. Users who frequently download resources are recommended to choose enterprise-grade hard drives. Common ones include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Western Blue Disc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seagate Exos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large capacity mechanical hard drives are recommended to be partitioned, and frequent download operations should be fixed on a specific partition. If bad sectors appear later, they can be concentrated in one partition, and the current partition can be discarded, which can effectively extend the lifespan of the mechanical hard drive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;memory-frequency&#34;&gt;Memory Frequency
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a daily usage perspective, frequency will not have a significant impact on performance.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory timings (also known as RAM timings) are four parameters that describe the performance of Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM): CL, TRCD, TRP, andTRAS, measured in clock cycles. They are typically written as four digits separated by hyphens, for example 7-8-8-24. The fourth parameter (RAS) is often omitted, and sometimes a fifth parameter: Command rate (command rate), usually 2T or 1T, also written as 2N, 1N is added. These parameters specify the latency (delay time) that affects the speed of random access memory. Lower numbers generally indicate faster performance. The final element determining system performance is the actual latency, typically measured in nanoseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When converting memory timings to actual latency, it’s important to note that they are measured in clock cycles. Without knowing the clock cycle time, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to determine whether a set of numbers is faster or slower than another set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, DDR3-2000 memory with a clock frequency of 1000 MHz has a clock cycle of 1 ns. Based on this 1 ns clock, CL=7 gives an absolute latency of 7 ns. A faster DDR3-2666 (clock 1333 MHz, each cycle 0.75 ns) might use a larger CL=9, but the generated absolute latency of 6.75 ns is shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern DIMMs include a Serial Presence Detect (SPD) ROM chip that contains recommended memory timings for automatic configuration. The BIOS on the PC may allow users to adjust timings to improve performance (with the risk of instability), or in some cases increase stability (such as using suggested timings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Memory bandwidth is a measure of throughput for memory and is typically limited by transfer rates rather than latency. By interleaving access to multiple internal banks of SDRAM, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to transmit at peak rates continuously. Increasing latency may be used to increase bandwidth. Specifically, each new generation of DDR memory has higher transmission rates, but absolute latency has not changed significantly, especially in the first-generation products on the market, which often have longer delays than the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with increased memory latency, increasing memory bandwidth can improve the performance of computer systems with multiple processors or multiple execution threads. Higher bandwidth will also boost the performance of integrated graphics cards that do not have dedicated video memory.

        <title>Website Acceleration and Domain Settings</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/website-acceleration-and-domain-setup/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 10:36:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/website-acceleration-and-domain-setup/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to slow access to GitHub Pages from within the country, the author applied for a personal domain and purchased CDN acceleration services from a domestic cloud host provider. During the configuration process, the author encountered an issue where the www subdomain could not be accessed, which was ultimately resolved by deleting the generic domain DNS record and setting up a second-level domain separately. The author also shared the principles and configuration experience of CDN acceleration, as well as their attempts and lessons learned using reverse proxy with Nginx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, and due to some well-known reasons, accessing GitHub Pages internally can be slow. Therefore, I applied for a personal domain name and purchased CDN acceleration services from a domestic cloud host provider. When configuring the acceleration service, I thought about my development machine, which has Docker, frp, k8s, and other services deployed on it – all with their respective dashboards. Following the principle of not wasting anything, I configured several reverse proxies, all using subdomains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was happily using these subdomains, I discovered that the www subdomain could no longer be accessed. In the Alibaba Cloud console, I had configured DNS to resolve both &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.xiangtianlong.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;www.xiangtianlong.com&lt;/a&gt; and xiangtianlong.com, and hadn’t yet enabled CDN acceleration; at that time, both domains were working normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When configuring CDN acceleration, due to a large number of subdomains, I enabled generic domain rules, which unified routed all traffic to the development machine. As a result, the www subdomain also went down – yes, you read that right, the “www” prefix was a subdomain. In reality, the website is deployed on GitHub Pages, and the development machine has no caching information for the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for why the website wasn’t deployed on the development machine, it&amp;rsquo;s because it’s a static blog, paired with GitHub’s action to automatically integrate publishing – truly delicious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;domain&#34;&gt;Domain
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-professional web development, the understanding of domains does not involve SEO or cross-origin issues. As a blog site, a bare domain easily highlights the blogger&amp;rsquo;s site, such as myself who uses Chinese pinyin as my domain name, and given that mobile access is now more prevalent, it’s preferable to input fewer characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyboard shortcuts can be used on desktop to avoid entering “www” and “com”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cdn&#34;&gt;CDN
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used both Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud, and it’s easy for newcomers to get started. Tencent Cloud also has dedicated video explanations of the related concepts. The principle of CDN acceleration is similar to that of a JD.com warehouse: new products are pre-distributed to warehouses across China, and when delivery requests are triggered, they&amp;rsquo;re distributed locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Origin Address: The address where the original website resources are stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache file settings: Using F12 in your browser’s developer console to analyze static and dynamic resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All 0 days validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.php;.jsp;.asp;.aspx&lt;/code&gt; 0 days validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.jpg;.png;.js;.css;.woff2&lt;/code&gt; 1 day validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tencent Cloud configuration rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can configure up to 10 cache expiration rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The priority of multiple cache expiration rules is bottom-first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache expiration time can be set up to a maximum of 365 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;miserable-confession&#34;&gt;Miserable Confession
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had never used Nginx before, assuming that just searching for a website would reveal the configuration for reverse proxy. The result was quite confusing, and I spent half a day without even getting a 302 redirect to work. So, I decided to take a brute-force approach – deleting wildcard domain resolution patterns in DNS parsing and setting up individual second-level domains. Suddenly, I noticed that Alibaba Cloud DNS had a feature called &amp;ldquo;Display URL Redirect,&amp;rdquo; which worked perfectly as a 302 redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up the first second-level domain normally, and then when I tried to set up the second one, it didn&amp;rsquo;t work. I was starting to doubt my sanity. After waiting for a while, it suddenly started working – apparently, Alibaba Cloud DNS sometimes has hiccups with its DNS propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zhihu.com/question/20414602&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Why are more and more website domain names not prefixed with &amp;ldquo;www&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cloudxns.net/Support/detail/id/918.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between domains with and without &amp;ldquo;www&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gythialy.github.io/Docker-nginx-reverse-proxy/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>Blog IDE Environment and Ramblings</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-ide-environment-and-ramblings/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 13:54:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-ide-environment-and-ramblings/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This article introduces the basic concepts of Markdown and its applications in various software, recommends using VSCode as an IDE, and lists recommended plugins. The author shares their experience switching from Hexo to Hugo, emphasizing Hugo’s flexibility and customization capabilities. Finally, it provides some suggestions for quickly getting started with new technologies and shares a trick for resolving the issue of Hugo theme styles not updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lightweight markup language that allows people to write documents in an easy-to-read and -write plain text format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;markdown-1&#34;&gt;Markdown
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed Markdown syntax will not be elaborated upon in this document. We recommend an ebook, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://markdown-zh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;. Many software applications on the market now support MD as a writing format. The csdn blog system has launched an online editor that supports MD syntax; the default article when first using it is an introduction to MD syntax, which I think is quite good. Evernote added support for MD notes in 2018, with various MD markers available in the shortcut bar, making it almost as easy to use as editing a regular article, and the overall interaction process is friendly to beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ide-recommendations&#34;&gt;IDE Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing this article, it’s already 2020 – you’ve undoubtedly heard of VS Code, after all, anyone thinking about using Git Page to build a blog system is an industry professional. In the early years, Sublime and Atom were also good choices. Thanks to two years of promotion by the open-source community, VS Code has developed rapidly and has gradually become the preferred choice for newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Microsoft’s giant corporation and the open-source community has successfully transitioned from a state of division into a honeymoon phase: embracing open source. My company has also actively introduced the Java ecosystem in recent two years, meaning that in business development, Java&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem is currently very fragrant domestically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vs-code-plugin-recommendations&#34;&gt;VS Code Plugin Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/blog-ide-environment-and-ramblings/2020-03-31-14-07-17.png&#34;
	width=&#34;310&#34;
	height=&#34;306&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Plugin List&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;101&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;243px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All plugins have their own Readme files, introducing basic usage, core functions, and some authors even provide demo screenshots.
&lt;code&gt;Paste Image&lt;/code&gt;, combined with Hugo&amp;rsquo;s image plugin method, is very convenient for importing images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t remember the shortcuts, open the VS Code shortcut management menu, search for “md”, read it several times; review it again to see the plugin usage instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I switched from Hexo to Hugo, as I love tinkering – it’s just my nature! Ultimately, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the urge to quietly write articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo supports placing images and Markdown documents in a single folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Academic theme supports various article styles in its design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various convenient customization extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;academic&#34;&gt;academic
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The default website is &lt;code&gt;exampleSite&lt;/code&gt;, and menu introduction uses the &lt;code&gt;#component&lt;/code&gt; approach. It’s recommended to use &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The URL pattern allows for single-page navigation when clicking on navigation links, rather than scrolling to the homepage. This is purely a matter of personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style: Notebooks, Speeches, eBooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility: Customization of overall style and custom CSS styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme’s Chinese support isn&amp;rsquo;t fully complete; primarily from a visual perspective, the font sizes don’t align well with Chinese reading habits. However, Hexo’s development team is largely comprised of Chinese developers, which is an advantage over Hugo in this regard.  Nevertheless, “you get what you build” – manually customize your browser elements. When locating an element to determine the CSS style name to modify, clicking &lt;strong&gt;Insert Style Rule Below&lt;/strong&gt; allows you to easily obtain the node name even with nested CSS layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/customization/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Introduce &lt;code&gt;custom.css&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/customization/#add-scripts-js&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Introduce &lt;code&gt;custom_js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The theme’s built-in syntax highlighting settings can be found here: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/#highlighting-options.&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Official Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kids are complaining again, saying you talk in such a vague and unclear way, without mentioning any details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to say is that with these things, you have enough to work with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Official Manuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugin Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When quickly getting started with new technologies, it’s recommended to first read the official website documentation, &lt;strong&gt;scanning through&lt;/strong&gt; – not aiming for a single thorough reading.  The results you get from search engines may not always be consistent with the latest version and could potentially mislead you. Reviewing a new book in the same way is also advisable: first look at the table of contents to understand what the author intends to cover, and sometimes it’s beneficial to read the introduction – particularly with translated foreign books, the preface often covers the core content of the book and its scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-eggs&#34;&gt;Easter Eggs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching the Hugo Academic built-in style settings and publishing to the site, the style didn&amp;rsquo;t change when accessed. A clever teammate already figured it out – clearing local browser cache solved the problem.  I, being equally ingenious, used: F12 developer mode, switched to &lt;code&gt;network&lt;/code&gt;, checked &lt;code&gt;disable cache&lt;/code&gt;, refreshed, and voila!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Automatic System Switchover</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/auto-integration-system-switch/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 02:11:33 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your Hugo blog to GitHub Pages and Gitee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;background-introduction&#34;&gt;Background Introduction
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday while updating the blog, I discovered that the travis service was unavailable. Upon checking the travis webpage, I noticed the progress was stuck during source code retrieval, and a flash of insight occurred – I thought about GitHub’s previously launched action service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to being busy at the time and also needing to apply for access to use action, it has now officially gone live. With some free weekend time, I decided to try out a new toy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official documentation can be found by entering the website yourself; this article won&amp;rsquo;t provide further reprints. If you’ve used Kubernetes before, you’ll find that the action YAML file configuration is very similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding introductory tutorials or Chinese introduction materials, I recommend searching for &lt;strong&gt;阮一峰’s blog&lt;/strong&gt;. There are two articles – the first introduces the basic syntax, and the second provides a practical case study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;#### Content

Required Knowledge Points
- GitHub Secrets
- Action Syntax
Core jobs use existing components to complete, pushing to domestic Gitee uses command implementation, this command part is quite brutal, all are forced pushes, inherited from the logic used with Travis.

```yaml
name: github pages and gitee pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - hugo

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          submodules: true

      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: &#39;latest&#39;
          extended: true

      - name: Build Github and Gitee ## Single step can only write one run command
        run: hugo -b &amp;quot;https://www.xiangtianlong.com/&amp;quot; -d &amp;quot;github_public&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; hugo -b &amp;quot;https://www.xiangtianlong.com/&amp;quot; -d &amp;quot;gitee_public&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ls

      - name: Deploy Github
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.BLOG_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./github_public
          publish_branch: master
          cname: xiangtianlong.com

      - name: Deploy Gitee
        run: cd ./gitee_public &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git init &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git config user.name &amp;quot;TianlongXiang&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git config user.email &amp;quot;tianlongxiang51@gmail.com&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git add . &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git commit -m &amp;quot;Update TianlongXiang&#39;s Blog&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git push --force &amp;quot;https://xiangtianlong:${{ secrets.GITEE_PASSWORD }}@gitee.com/xiangtianlong/xiangtianlong.git&amp;quot; master:master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
#### Epilogue

Based on the actions provided by the official market, currently there are quite a few supported playstyles. After building a Docker image, it’s no longer dependent on services offered by Docker Hub. 

Reviewing the Hugo issues, using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy Git Pages results in the final published website needing to be on the master branch. If deployed from another branch, the settings interface will prompt an error indicating that the deployed webpage has syntax problems.

This is simply because Hugo’s source files are located on the master branch, and GitHub treats it as the Jelly blog&#39;s source code for detection, unable to check and resolve any errors resulting in the error message. 

The solution is straightforward: move Hugo source files to another branch and publish static files to the master branch.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hope that twenty years from now, I’ll be a cute old man, spending time with a cute old woman. I don&amp;rsquo;t seek great wealth or status; just to be healthy and strong enough to travel and explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video-transcript&#34;&gt;Video Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to Youku Search, and no further links will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said that in 10 years, I’ll be a charming old man, and I will work hard to become a charming old man. The future of China must be one with good old men and good old women. Even if I am 60 years old in 10 years, I will be the youngest person in this world&amp;rsquo;s third kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly speaking, if everyone sees the 50-year-old Chinese man with this physique, it’s quite impressive. But behind this physique is a phrase I believe in: the more disciplined you are, the freer you become! When it rains, I want to go for a run; tomorrow afternoon, I will play soccer. At 50 years old, I can still play big games, and it&amp;rsquo;s not a joke. Moreover, I often play with professionals. But what’s behind this? It’s discipline. I spend my remaining days running, and people might find running very monotonous. The more disciplined you are, the freer you become. Because of my discipline, I can run freely, without listening to music – because I think my own breathing is the most beautiful music while running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I basically don&amp;rsquo;t run on a treadmill. And many people in Beijing experience severe smog; I run 5 days a week, and two days are left for the smog. Then, jokingly, I say it might be because I never stop. Every month, I draw one day of my running experience in my diary – at least 18 days each month, and when I run, they just flash by. When I run, I also take off my glasses, but more importantly, I still play soccer every week. My graduate students’ last lecture is always held at our home on that particular day, with a theme called “Fun.” I think fun is very important. I never deal with people who lack any joy or hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would rather avoid such people – they are too frightening; if you don&amp;rsquo;t have fun, you feel like you have nothing to enjoy. You like what kind of job? In early January this year, one of my graduate students wrote for &lt;em&gt;China Weekly&lt;/em&gt;, and we had a special issue called “Looking Ahead.” Ten years from now, my graduate students will, at the end of each graduation year, write an essay for me – and I keep those essays. Then, ten years later, I’ll continue to develop them, and I&amp;rsquo;ll also write one as a 50-year-old to a 60-year-old; 60 is a distant land that I never thought of before, but it’s just another stop on my way to 20 – writing to my students who are 30. That’s like a love letter from spring to summer. But when I&amp;rsquo;m 50 and write to 60, it’s like autumn whispering to fall. Now, I’m writing to myself ten years from now, from the whole world, about my bed, a meal, and the company of my family – this is normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what will I be at 60? My title is very clear: in this long article, I said that in 10 years, I’ll be a charming old man, and China wants to be charming not just because there will be more young people like citizens who become citizens, no longer just ordinary people; energetic young people, young people who understand rules. The future of China must be one with good old men and good old women. Currently, over 60-year-olds in China exceed 2.3 billion – and that number will definitely exceed three billion in 10 years, meaning that if you consider only the population over 60, China would be among the top five countries in the world, or even the third. Imagine how frightening that is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t find it frightening. I wonder if you&amp;rsquo;ve seen online a table of the average life expectancy in various provinces and municipalities of China – Shanghai and Beijing both exceed 80 years, including men and women. Men naturally occupy a larger share of the female population. That means even if I am 60 years old in 10 years, I will be one of the youngest people in this world&amp;rsquo;s third kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future. If women retire at 55 with an average life expectancy of 80 years, and they continue for 25 years after retirement; if men retire at 60 with an average life expectancy of 80, and they continue for 20 years after retirement! You won’t do anything but dance square dances. And I can say that the older ladies and gentlemen who are dancing square dances today are cultural habits and entertainment styles brought to them by the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty - I was one of the youngest members of the team when I was 60 years old, and I should be what kind of person? Chinese painting says that at 60, your ears become attuned, and I believe I wouldn’t listen to anything then, always happy, still annoyed by things I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t mention, and even happiness would turn into unhappiness. More importantly, I need to figure out what to do for the young people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should we do for good things? Don’t be lazy, don’t easily compromise, speak up when you need to oppose, because young people might harm their interests, can you stand in front of them and block their way? I often look at myself in the mirror now. My good friend, Tao Wei, passed away – he used to gather with us at our home, and once told me a true story. We collectively mourned together, and back then, the older generation like Chen Lao would hoard things at home, spilling everything out of the box, hiding 30-odd items under the bed. You need to tell him how much that piece of clothing cost – over 500 yuan – and then support it, lighting incense every day. Therefore, this generation of ours is used to fighting with our parents, arguing about knowledge and ideas. How much did we buy back for 700 yuan?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;220&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But it’s risky. Once, Tao Wei bought a T-shirt for his father for over 400 yuan. That shirt was really good – how much did it cost? 99, I wore it. The next day, disaster struck. When he came back from work, he praised Tao Wei and gave him 400 yuan to buy four more shirts for me. After I wore it out, Zhang Shu Li Da Ye all thought it was great, and later said the risk of lying like this is very large. Don’t do such things in the future. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to mention a specific person – in the hospital orthopedic department, an elderly man broke his bone, and the most important reason was that he bought shoes from a street vendor. Of course, I’m only talking about this on a material level. Even when you get old, you still need spiritual life and curiosity, and you should be willing to shield young people from the wind and rain, live one day happily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very curious and excitedly waiting for my 60th birthday to arrive. I think it’s the beginning of a beautiful time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thank you all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The very common phrase &lt;strong&gt;information fragmentation&lt;/strong&gt; – since graduating from high school, aside from the time I spent reading novels, I haven’t really taken the time to sit down and read a book quietly and attentively for a long time. Sometimes, looking back, after so many years of work, I still remember what I did each year? Often, by the middle of the year, I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten a lot of things from the first half. Writing a blog is a good habit, even though much of what I write isn’t appropriate and doesn’t matter – it was originally written for myself to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most loyal readers are myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of my own 18 years was like a gaze of anticipation and questioning, and each person occasionally asks themselves, &amp;ldquo;Are you the way you wanted to live back then?&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that everyone now has countless circles, no friends, chatting all day long, no one to have a heart-to-heart conversation with, unlimited knowledge acquisition, yet far from wisdom. Everyone should use your 18 years to ask yourself, &amp;ldquo;Are you the way you wanted to live back then?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think each of my own 18 years was like a gaze of anticipation and questioning. You can deceive others, but you cannot deceive your 18-year-old self. Is today you the way you were supposed to be at 18? I feel it&amp;rsquo;s okay. Today, material fame and many other things have been obtained, which is much more than what I thought when I was 18, but on the other hand, we are always on the road. When I was in journalism school at the Broadcasting Academy, I wanted to become a top reporter like Faraway, and today I&amp;rsquo;m still on that path. But this is exactly what many people say about Mr. Bai – &amp;ldquo;How have you stayed on CCTV because you want to be a good journalist?&amp;rdquo; News is still there. This is my 18-year-old gaze, so I think everyone occasionally asks themselves, “Are you the way you wanted to live back then?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is truly impossible to deceive others. This is my appearance at 18, but it’s gone in a blink of an eye. Twenty-eight years have passed. Every person who comes to Beijing to study will have such a photo album. In that era, the wrinkled suit on Tianmen Square, and the school badge pinned to the chest, because at that time there were few college students, no school badges, feeling very proud. Their hair was long back then, but they still liked their 18-year-old appearance. Many years later, I suddenly realized I was grateful for the things I faced at 18, because it silently shaped me. In 1986, on May 8th, I bought a selection of Misty Poems at Wangfujing Bookstore. That year, I listened to Cui Jian’s “One and All” at the Workers&amp;rsquo; Stadium. Today, I suddenly realized that my writing style was most influenced by it, including my personality being influenced by Misty Poetry, Rock Music, and Lu Guhong’s martial arts novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did you experience at 18? You can carry that with you. I especially want to know what the 18-year-olds today are experiencing? Are they being carved up like a knife chopping wood? What tools are they using? What kind of appearance are they shaping? I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that everyone now has countless circles, no friends, chatting all day long, no one to have a heart-to-heart conversation with, unlimited knowledge acquisition, yet far from wisdom, knowing nothing and seemingly everyone is talking about individuality. But as an observer, I find that today’s young people are very similar. What should I do? What should I let the 18-year-old experience? I really like 1986 because 1986 was the best way to solve 1966.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1966 Cultural Revolution was ended by 76 in 1986, which had a degree of chance; it could only be ended by the enlightenment and awakening of human nature and the growth of every individual. This truly allows you to dig up the concerns you have. I think we still need enlightenment, we still need to fully understand human nature. No matter how much economic progress or changes China has made, if we don’t truly fill in the understanding of human nature, and then respond to the good side of human nature and control the bad side, there will still be many things that worry us in the future. So my 18 years were also this era&amp;rsquo;s 18 years, it&amp;rsquo;s gone too far, don’t forget why you started in the first place, now condensed into four big words: “初心”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think no matter how far you go, everyone should use your 18 years to ask yourself. So taking a photo at 18 is good, and often take it out to ask yourself. What others say doesn’t matter? It&amp;rsquo;s too difficult to deceive yourself. I just said to today’s 20-year-olds, “You should always let your 18-year-old be the eyes that watch you.”  I also mentioned earlier that in my twenties, you should try many doors, because you don’t know which one is most suitable for you&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This excerpt recounts the author’s perspective on the profession of journalism, emphasizing that reporters should possess a social conscience, a broad knowledge base, and perseverance. The author also shares their reflections at age 50, including maintaining curiosity, achieving balance between material and spiritual pursuits, and contemplating the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best journalist is first, having a social conscience; second, possessing knowledge; and third, being able to run long distances. I couldn’t handle running 100 meters – I ran it. I believe these three things combined, people expect the safety concerns surrounding vaccines to be completely resolved, just like with the melamine scandal. We always move forward in a logic loop of problems arising, solving problems, and completely resolving them. Otherwise, what is there for a journalist to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-1&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe the best journalist first has a social conscience, second has knowledge reserves, and third can run long distances – I’ve outrun the 100 meters, so it’s no problem. I think these three things combined, at 50 years old, you’ll understand that I seem to be well-suited for journalism. I&amp;rsquo;m naturally intertwined with China’s 40 years of reform, and on my 30th birthday, standing by the banks of the Songhua River, when I was 40, my birthday coincided with the 2008 Olympics, and I came out of the Olympic broadcast in which I went in. At 50 this year, as China commemorates 40 years of reform and opening up, there’s certainly a corresponding connection – whether the “Great Era” is at forty or China’s reform is at fifty-five?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that after walking through 40 years of road, China has already given people enough in terms of material things, and to the country enough. However, anxiety and confusion have increased, not decreased. We thought we were strong and wealthy, so everything was OK, but we discovered that material wealth is just a foundation; it’s difficult to become spiritually rich and truly a great power. The United States is already attacking your high-tech, we need to attack agricultural products. There&amp;rsquo;s always been a saying in the world: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s hard for second place to be achieved!&amp;rdquo; How many Second Place countries has America fixed? Therefore, we must go through a long period of time to transform “not one” into surpassing ourselves. I can’t get everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate that I started doing television at 25, first from figure interviews, and I contacted hundreds or thousands of figures with various halos. At that time, young people thought that these halos must make them very happy, but when they got closer, they found no, the halos have little to do with their happiness, and sometimes they are inversely proportional. Recently, I just finished reading about Guo Moruo’s last 29 years – Guo Moruo barely escaped persecution, serving as Deputy Minister of State Council, Vice Chairman of CPPCC, Vice Chairwoman of National People&amp;rsquo;s Congress, etc. But his two sons committed suicide, and the other may have been thrown to death from a building? Would he be happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you use to measure happiness? When you are in your sixties, two of your sons leave you in a few years; even if you’re a Deputy Minister, can you be happy? Many famous paintings can make people happy, and spending many years safely is enough to make you happy. What do you want? So I think looking at people is the best mirror. To say something more important, I think much of our anxiety now comes from thinking too much and reading too little books. This is Yang Geng’s reply to a young person – if you don&amp;rsquo;t read books, you rely on fast food; you pick up a mobile phone and plan to find a miracle pill. How can that be? I learned cleverness through the slow process of more and more books; subtraction comes from reading more books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I don’t expect everyone to achieve it, but I hope the proportion increases – more and more Chinese people can read themselves better in books, which is the most important thing. No one sits on the ground and looks up at the stars, trying to figure out everything. I can&amp;rsquo;t do that. But I can look in a mirror. A few years ago, when a BBC news anchor came to Beijing, claiming to be the “most awesome” news anchor in BBC, he had someone organize a dialogue between him and a Chinese news anchor; we talked. That guy asked me during the conversation, &amp;ldquo;What do you think BBC should learn from CCTV?&amp;rdquo; I first made a joke and said, of course, they should first learn Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, after making a joke, I said, “I think BBC most needs to learn from CCTV is their curiosity about this world.” We’ve been observing the world with great curiosity these years as we quickly reach out to the world; we have more than 70 correspondents now, and we feel that when a student sees something new in foreign countries, he feels very curious. We carry a huge sense of curiosity and observe the world, while BBC has already considered Britain itself as the world. You don’t need to be curious anymore. The brother slapped the table and said, “What we lack is this thing.” In 2007, when I interviewed a Japanese writer, he told me, &amp;ldquo;Japan&amp;rsquo;s country besides lacking hope, has everything else.&amp;rdquo; Later I realized that this sentence was really deep; from another angle, ten years ago, I thought China Okay, here’s the English translation of the provided text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m very worried that China will one day end up on the downside – feeling truly impoverished even when everything is available. I fear that by the time I’m 50, I’ll become a person who, despite having all material comforts, is incredibly poor. The problem in our reality is that there are many highly educated people with no culture, and many impoverished individuals with countless numbers on their bank accounts. That&amp;rsquo;s really what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with this era. True poverty isn&amp;rsquo;t frightening because there’s a forward direction and hope. This is why I say that a lack of morality and human failings are the root cause. Therefore, I believe scientists invented so much not because they initially carried great missions, but out of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to figure it out myself. So I&amp;rsquo;ve always encouraged myself to be curious, especially around 50 years old. That’s why I’m happy now. One thing that bothers me is persistence – as you were saying you’re still persisting. I said don’t say that persistence leads to death. In the past, we used to say ‘persistence equals success,’ and ‘China football will persevere even during the black minutes,’ or ‘persevere,’ but it loses its fun and method, so we rely on perseverance. Sometimes persistence is important, but often it has an opposite side. I’m afraid that when I do something, like chatting with people, I&amp;rsquo;ll persist in finishing what I started – which is now too late for my time, but I’m curious to see how these conversations will turn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give myself a small keyword and engage in conversation with others. At 50 years old, as long as you can still maintain a great deal of curiosity, there&amp;rsquo;s no problem. I like all fun things, but not necessarily the most popular things today. Trendy terms change quickly – do you remember some of them? Will a media outlet on the internet 10 years from now become a traditional media outlet? So fun things always have their own intrinsic appeal. I respect everyone’s preferences; there must be a reason behind it, but when viewed over the long term, we see that Chinese people most enjoy playing mahjong. If you also like eating fast food, then restaurants serving large meals will naturally decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things aren&amp;rsquo;t just about expressing an emotion and moving on. How much fragmented reading do you get from your daily mobile phone use? How much longer-form reading do you have? But this is also a process – the mobile phone is becoming our handcuffs. So, seeing shorter content more often leads to short-sightedness. However, I don’t worry about ‘content is king.’ It will always return. You won&amp;rsquo;t keep entertaining yourself until your 40s, like I see teenagers drinking soda and telling them to drink less, but you know they will still drink it. On the other hand, I’m optimistic – he’ll eventually return to a tea-drinking lifestyle. This is the life of a Chinese person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s normal, but I hope the transformation will happen faster. We just express an emotion, and there are fewer investigative reporters now. You don&amp;rsquo;t read investigations. Thank you everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What will Chinese football be like in 20 years?</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The supplementary reader responses were mostly hastily written in 2021. The time it took to transcribe Wang Yi’s speeches at the beginning of the pandemic was still when things were just starting – don&amp;rsquo;t say twenty years later, or even a year or two later; the world is always beyond people’s expectations. Now that the epidemic has ended domestically in China, the overseas ones are still making a fuss. Regarding football, Chinese national team played quite well over the past few years; the coach dared to give them free rein and attack, which was much better than when they were just starting out and accompanying Grandpa to watch games was somewhat interesting. What kind of experience is it that a national team’s game makes even an old man unwilling to change channels?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you still curious about Chinese football? Curious, very curious, what could be the difference? So you find that Chinese football plays badly because everyone is afraid to lose the ball in their own area and pass it to others, leaving themselves out; there&amp;rsquo;s no such way of playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is just one of many small reasons. When talking about 20 years of football, 20 years from now China’s football seems so distant – the first expansion became 48 teams, and China might go or not go; the best age for a national team is 26-30, so 20 years later, those children aged 6 to 10 will be considered optimistic, but 20 years later it’s definitely going to be fine. When I mention children aged 6-10 today, you immediately look serious. Therefore, cause and effect – what are we planting today? What will grow if we plant soybeans today? We almost planted soybeans that would make the national team play in the league, and what would come out of it? Whoever initiates this action will be prepared to be dismissed; this goes against the rules, so I didn’t think about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you should really think about those children aged 6-10 today – are they playing football? If you know what Chinese football will be like in 20 years…&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s the translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To do things properly, first and foremost, you need to have a clear conscience. This allows you to sleep soundly, without minor ailments or major issues. It&amp;rsquo;s best to avoid making mistakes in the first place. If you do make a mistake, it should be about trying to rectify it, not concealing it or hoping to forget it yourself – humans are also capable of excellent memory. Inner peace is the destination; being able to answer your own questions with integrity allows you to live more lightly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have eight words to say that are quite heavy, and I feel we’re currently experiencing a moral deficit, a depletion of humanity, and the times are constantly presenting problems that require solutions – a completely resolved logical cycle forward. You need patience to wait for its shuffling. For a country like China, many things are a slow shuffling process, so don&amp;rsquo;t be pessimistic about change; it&amp;rsquo;s being shuffled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These past few days, China has been battling two typhoons: one was intangible, and the other was tangible. The intangible typhoon is the vaccine, which is impacting our inner security dam. The other typhoon rarely landed in Shanghai, and then caused trouble for Beijing and Tianjin – a rare occurrence over several decades. This is an aside; next, you need to consider whether you can improve yourself, whether you’ve undergone significant changes, and whether you have many answers. If the surrounding environment remains unchanged, will you be happy? I have eight words to say that are quite heavy: I feel we currently have a moral deficit and a depletion of humanity – this is the biggest deficit and the greatest loss at present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, people expect the vaccine’s safety risks to be completely resolved. This is like the case with melamine milk powder, so sometimes you need to look at history and understand that you know about the establishment and formation of the US Food and Drug Administration, which is closely related to the initial unsafe milk and dairy products. The Sanlu Milk Powder incident forced China to undergo significant changes in the dairy industry. While vaccines are not happening one after another, I hope this time it’s a halt. You need to know that times always present problems, solve them completely – this is the logical cycle forward; otherwise, what do reporters do? What do citizens do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I believe that each of us can do is to be concerned. But the problem is that Chinese people are easily forgetful, like I just said, after bumping into someone’s car, we stop on the side of the road and run away; no one blocks us. Our neighbors and colleagues have a large proportion of these kinds of people. So we need to change slowly. And as ordinary citizens, what we can do is to pay attention and not forget. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it’s a lack of something; when you’re hungry and cold, you talk about ideals all the time – that doesn’t have persuasive power. But when he’s full and warm, he turns himself into China’s number one country for diabetes and high blood pressure, etc., you realize that Chinese people start running and dieting, and you ask the ladies present here, who hasn&amp;rsquo;t experienced the hardship of not being able to lose weight because they didn&amp;rsquo;t eat a good meal? This is a small change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are talking about the spiritual level, which must be the same principle. When you’re full and warm, you start running and dieting, then your spiritual needs will gradually increase. For example, I used to smoke, but after I started running, I unconsciously found that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t smoked for 20 days. I haven’t smoked since. Of course, I wouldn’t deliberately say, “I completely quit smoking,” because it feels too ritualistic; it doesn’t rule out occasionally smoking two or three cigarettes during the year. When your lifestyle changes, many things will change with it. I think for Chinese people, you need patience to wait for its shuffling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more people feel unhappy and unwilling to indulge themselves. Although depression is increasing, on the other hand, isn’t there also an increasing number of people seeking positive ways to live? At this time, spiritual things will grow. Don&amp;rsquo;t be pessimistic; look at the same thing in different ways. I often see drivers cutting people off in traffic, and I feel frustrated. But then I realize that the queue on the other side is longer than before – this is how it is. You are sitting here on a rainy evening, willing to chat about useless things, isn’t that fun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a transformation; therefore, many things need to be thought of in a different way. Of course, I think there will be more and more things to grow in the future, such as when you start a business, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t start a business? Everyone&amp;rsquo;s life is starting a business. Su Shi wasn’t starting a business? Li Bai wasn’t starting a business? - Data Mining&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the English translation of the text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There will be countless failures throughout a lifetime, and ultimately, creating your own brand is what matters. Most failures don&amp;rsquo;t matter if you don’t create them, as long as you live a life full of flavor and believe it’s worth it. I feel that China particularly lacks a good value system: failure is another form of success. People only accept the successful outcome, but failing well is also a success – they don’t accept this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I find it difficult; you see many reasons why Chinese football isn’t playing well, and one of them is that everyone is afraid to lose possession and pass it to someone else. There’s no such strategy. Of course, this is just a small part of the problem. As I get older, at 30 years old, writing about the preface and happiness doesn&amp;rsquo;t come quickly; now at 50, there’s some urgency because time is passing too fast, and you expect many things to become reality. But on the other hand, I understand that for a country like China, many things are a slow shuffling process. You see older generations – some were once nothing more than traffic lights, but occasionally you&amp;rsquo;ll see children pulling their fathers along as they change. They’re changing and being shuffled; so I think you need to be patient.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Regarding time, you need to read many books to find the answers.</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In general, the country is getting better and stronger, richer – and that’s without diminishing the importance of individual vanity. Looking back from the 1990s to now, within the families I’ve encountered, people&amp;rsquo;s lives have undeniably improved significantly. Simultaneously, the number of wealthy individuals has increased. As market-oriented economic development inevitably leads to widening income inequality, issues like class solidification and blocked upward mobility are prevalent globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is often discussed – such as rigid social strata and limited opportunities for advancement – are common problems worldwide. However, it’s important to acknowledge the Communist Party&amp;rsquo;s contributions to people’s basic welfare and social security, something everyone should take note of. Life will continue to improve; if you don’t want to buy a house, you can rent one. There are still inequalities in educational resources for children, requiring choices between better job opportunities, improved work environments, or more time with family. Don&amp;rsquo;t impose your own ideas on others, including your children and family members. Sit down and talk it through – life will inevitably get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
I’m now exactly 50 years old this year, and in the past I never thought about it; I felt that this was an old man. Now I realize it&amp;rsquo;s truly an old man – this is what I looked like at 30. When I was 30, I didn’t feel very young, good-looking, and when I was 50 years old, looking back, it’s not bad; the biggest life lesson at 30? Looking back. I think it&amp;rsquo;s subtraction – the key word is subtraction.  Somehow, &amp;ldquo;painfully happy&amp;rdquo; is also a kind of subtraction, letting you experience and write down many things, then leave them there on a new blank sheet, or running; but for me, at 30, I really feel that whether it’s about myself or reminding others, subtraction is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently guiding college students from China Central Television (CCTV), and I often remind them to &amp;ldquo;go all out&amp;rdquo; to add before they turn 30 – to try things, you don&amp;rsquo;t know what kind of possibilities you have, you don’t know what opportunities fate will give you. It’s not about knowing; but some people work hard in their twenties, adding everything, but forget to stop when it’s time for subtraction. I think 30 is a very important period in life – after doing a series of additions and running around everywhere, you need to do a significant subtraction; otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s too late. Why do you need to subtract? Not everything suits you, not everything is suitable for you; you should do all things, but not necessarily &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; things.&lt;/p&gt;

By the time I was 30, I had been promoted to a full professor – in other words, academically speaking, it&amp;rsquo;s called a professor; as for journalism, it&amp;rsquo;s a senior journalist. I was promoted at 29, and this kind of thing is rare now, but I started to feel a huge confusion when I did the Sydney Olympics in 2000.  I suddenly felt that everything wasn’t right. I had to ask myself, “What exactly do you want to do? Which things should be discarded?” That year, I made an important subtraction – I stopped my show for a year, without appearing anywhere, and at that time people told me, &amp;ldquo;As a host, if you don&amp;rsquo;t appear on screen for a month, it’s okay; if you don’t appear for six months, no one will remember you.” I said, “My face is really cheap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, I started to develop new programs. This was after finishing “Painfully Happy” in 2001 – I stopped for a whole year. Everything I see today is a reflection on that time of subtraction. At that time, I could do many things – I could do sports, I could do E (likely referring to the internet), I could do many other fun things, and be a producer; but I said no, I realized I could only do news, and I should do news most of all.  Then I was the producer for three programs, and I quit them overnight, and that’s what I am today. I became simpler. Just recently, I was chatting with a colleague, and I said, “When I was in my 30s, I made a very important decision – not just because there were many things I could do, but I felt like I was just doing news; this deep well is something that might promote you to deputy director; I refused it, and returned to a normal level.”&lt;/p&gt;

Now, I’m a central television station&amp;rsquo;s senior editor – not someone who graduated from university (undergraduate). You know our system, but I refused. I wanted to see how far a bachelor’s degree could go, and why a bachelor’s degree shouldn’t constantly learn and take students as assistants? Yes, now I have 11 students under my guidance, this is the result of subtraction.  Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s a reflection looking back. It’s also easy to feel in your youth that everything should be obtained – if anything hasn’t been obtained, if something has a defect, you’ll feel very uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don’t learn to subtract yourselves; when you’re about to turn 30, at 28, when I saw the Olympics in 1996, I came up with a sentence: “Defect is an important part of “The moon is best when it’s not yet full. But for ordinary people, it will always be seen as a flaw, not perfect enough, not reaching the extreme. The worst way to ruin someone is to make them pursue perfection and reach the ultimate goal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;flower-not-fully-open.jpg&#34; &gt;Flower Not Fully Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This world isn’t like that; the most wonderful time is when the flower hasn&amp;rsquo;t fully bloomed. When it’s full, it’s close to falling; when the moon starts to become full, it’s close to becoming a waning crescent. Therefore, I think this was a very important boost and inspiration for me at 30. 40 wasn’t as beautiful then. But I felt relaxed. More free. Why not stop dressing in suits and ties, why not always be black and white? Let&amp;rsquo;s start asking about happiness?”&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese say that 40 is not confused, while 30 is about subtraction. 40 is about confusion, not wisdom. I think in today’s era, 40 is likely the most confused age. My midlife crisis started surprisingly early, around thirty-six or seventy, when I began to question whether everything I had done was valuable and meaningful. I wondered what happiness I truly desired. This book was born out of this confusion – you&amp;rsquo;ll find that at 30, many of your happiness goals are tied to material possessions. “Thirty and established” refers to having your education firmly in place. You need a car and a house; otherwise, your mother-in-law won’t consider marrying off your wife to you—it’s very materialistic. However, &amp;ldquo;40 is not confused&amp;rdquo; is difficult to achieve. I think ancient people had longer life expectancies than we do now, so they condensed 40 years into one, hence the lack of confusion. I&amp;rsquo;m currently 40 and feeling confused, &lt;strong&gt;and material things haven’t brought me happiness as I thought they would.&lt;/strong&gt; Similarly, when many people ask me at 40, “Are you happy?” My book title is &amp;ldquo;Happiness Waves,&amp;rdquo; which represents a question—it reflects my inner turmoil. The emergence of the midlife crisis: at 40, you need to answer yourself many questions, talk to yourself frequently, and read extensively to find answers. I’m fortunate that when I was thirty-six or seventy, I entered the world of the &lt;em&gt;Tao Te Ching&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;White Talk&lt;/em&gt;, I already discussed this; at 40, if your surroundings don&amp;rsquo;t change, especially the soft environment – if you can stroll out of the house with a good mood and encounter countless red lights—buying something is often fake, getting vaccinated is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said that recently China has been battling two typhoons, one visible and one tangible. The invisible typhoon is vaccines, which attacks our inner security dam. The other typhoon, Chinese typhoons rarely land in Shanghai – this is a tangent; next, you need to think about whether you can focus on your own well-being. If your surroundings don’t change, will you be happy? &lt;strong&gt;I have an eight-character idiom that I find quite heavy: we are currently experiencing a deficit of morality and a loss of humanity—this is the biggest deficit and loss at present.&lt;/strong&gt; Recently, I witnessed two cars colliding; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too serious. The responsible party was because he had stopped on the side of the road, and the other driver was preparing to stop. But the car in front sped away without stopping him. Is that a responsible father? Is that a responsible son? Never mind how he would be a responsible citizen—he might even be your colleague. This is the deficit of morality and loss of humanity, which inevitably affects you. No matter how great a person you are, unless you haven’t left your home, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent your children from getting vaccinated, or sending takeout that may have problems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, how can Chinese people learn to transform from an ordinary citizen into a citizen—this might be at my 40, both asking myself and posing an important question to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 30 is about subtraction, 40 is about confusion, I think 50 should be about curiosity. 50 is awkward; you’re neither in the village nor out of it – you can attack if you go forward, retreat if you go back, and blend in if you stay put. If you lie down for ten years on something you&amp;rsquo;ve achieved, perhaps until retirement, that seems possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I read a book that said that truly successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are often older—50s or 60s. This is different from our concept. How can China stop treating entrepreneurship as a young career—just like how China doesn’t treat youth volunteers as youth volunteers. Last week, I did a program to recruit retired primary and secondary school teachers; they receive a subsidy of two or three hundred thousand yuan per year and go teach in rural areas – and must be excellent. This is truly opening the door for retirees to find new employment—of course, it’s not just charity, but getting back to 50 is still a distance away. How do you move forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifty-years-old&#34;&gt;Fifty Years Old

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, for a 50-year-old person, there are two challenges: the first is yourself – are you still curious about many things? What is your outlook on life? I think my biggest gain at 50, or the way I’m living now, is to treat every today well. Twenty years old tends to live in tomorrow, and at 50, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to dwell on yesterday. But I try to restrain myself, neither living in tomorrow nor in yesterday; I treat every today well. A 50-year-old shouldn’t always say “we’ll talk about it tomorrow” or “it was better back then!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back now, I realize I was young once too, I had so many hair, so I should cherish every day of today, because when you look back two years later, it&amp;rsquo;s best to see yourself as you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like Shen Shing said, &amp;ldquo;When my legs couldn’t walk anymore, I sat in a wheelchair and constantly reminisced about the time when I could run and play basketball. Every day was filled with pain in my memories.&amp;rdquo;
Years later, I developed bedsores on my wheelchair and felt miserable. At that time, I always remembered those peaceful moments of sitting quietly on the wheelchair.
After even more years, I got kidney failure and had to go dialysis. At that time, I would always remember the days when I only had bedsores on the wheelchair. If I hadn’t reached the point of treating every today well at 50, those next 50 years would have been wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifty-years-old-1&#34;&gt;Fifty Years Old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually feel that it’s not until you reach 50 to truly understand this principle; you should grasp it in your 30s or 40s, as all things are easily missed if you wait. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a meal during a trip – if you don’t eat it, you can still have it thirty years later, and even then, it might not be the same taste. Therefore, I believe treating every day with kindness is my first feeling at 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point is curiosity. I’ve realized that I can stop being curious about many things at any time, because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so much and experienced so much, but I encourage myself to remain curious. So when I do a lot of things now, I approach them with a sense of curiosity – can you hold your phone up for a shot? Yes, you can. You can do live reporting, attend seemingly large and solemn conferences, and even make the connection easier. It’s more fun and makes a bigger impression. You can then use new media to disseminate it. I believe curiosity is the most important driving force for human progress. Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be the most important driving force for individual progress? A nation will wither if it loses its curiosity. On a broader level, 50 is an important test. What kind of vested interests do you become at forty or fifty years old in China? I’m very worried that many people around me had dreams when they were young and went to achieve them, but once they achieved their dreams and became vested interests, they turned into those who blocked others from achieving their dreams, right? They would suddenly treat young people and things in the way they used to dislike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, several years ago, I started recruiting one graduate student each year as a volunteer, and they’ve stayed for two years; now five groups have graduated, with 55 pure graduate students. I believe it&amp;rsquo;s a happy thing to become a vested interest – you have certain insights, you can also guide them. After every class, I invite them to dinner, which doesn’t cost much. But this is what a good vested interest should do: a vested interest can be two aspects—one is to pave the way again. I once said that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to say thank you too often to those who helped me, because I want to repay them tenfold with new young people. This is how I express my gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re constantly saying “thank you” and then become a blocker…&lt;/strong&gt; The next thing is to pave the way for others. I hope that in China, whether it&amp;rsquo;s material, economic, ideological, or cultural, all vested interests – when you become one, what should you do? Yesterday, someone was pushing a cart; today they’re blocking the train. This has happened throughout Chinese history. It won’t be like this; sometimes it will even be worse, so I call on all vested interests to return to how they felt when they were young – to do things as they did then. Perhaps I wasn&amp;rsquo;t good enough, but I thought about it, did it, and said it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Standard Library Container Memory Allocators: allocator</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/standard-library-container-memory-allocator/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2019 13:26:19 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/standard-library-container-memory-allocator/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A custom allocator can improve performance, increase memory utilization efficiency, and address the issue of frequent, small memory allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;antecedent&#34;&gt;Antecedent
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the development of network data packets, requiring frequent allocation and release of small blocks of memory. Initially, I considered using a memory pool, reviewing several existing ones and discovering this:
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/cacay/MemoryPool&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/cacay/MemoryPool&lt;/a&gt;
When looking at the interface, I was quite puzzled by how the memory pool&amp;rsquo;s implementation was a bit strange. The &lt;code&gt;MemoryPool&lt;/code&gt; implementation logic involves allocating fixed-size memory blocks. Having reviewed Boost’s memory pool interface, it provides a template that is instantiated when used. Fortunately, this library already had an article describing it, mentioning the concept of an ‘allocator’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;#### [wiki](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E5%99%A8_(C%2B%2B))

In C++ programming, an allocator is a key component of the C++ standard library. The C++ standard library defines various data structures commonly referred to as &amp;quot;containers&amp;quot; (such as linked lists, sets, etc.). A common feature of these containers is that their size can be changed at runtime; therefore, dynamic memory allocation becomes necessary to achieve this. The allocator is used to handle memory allocation and deallocation requests made by the containers. In other words, the allocator encapsulates the low-level details of memory management for Standard Template Library (STL) containers. By default, the C++ standard library uses its built-in generic allocator, but programmers can customize allocators to replace it as needed.

The allocator was originally invented by Alexander Stepanov as part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), with the intention of creating a mechanism that would &amp;quot;make the library more flexible and allow independent use of low-level data models,&amp;quot; and enable programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types within the library; however, when the STL was incorporated into the C++ standard, the C++ standards committee realized that complete abstraction of the data model would result in unacceptable performance penalties. To compromise, restrictions on the allocator were made more stringent, and compared to Stepanov&#39;s original vision, the degree to which the current standard describes allocators is greatly limited.

Although customization of the allocator is somewhat restricted, it is still needed in many cases, typically for encapsulating access to different types of memory spaces (such as shared memory and reclaimed memory), or for improving performance when using a memory pool for memory allocation. In addition, from the perspective of memory usage and execution time, in programs that frequently perform small amounts of memory allocation, introducing a dedicated allocator can also yield benefits.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

#### [Usage Requirements](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E5%99%A8_(C%2B%2B))

The primary reason for defining custom allocators is to improve performance. Utilizing a dedicated custom allocator can increase program performance, or improve memory usage efficiency, or both [4][8]. The default allocator uses the `new` operator to allocate storage [Reference 5], which is often implemented using the C language heap allocation function (malloc()) [9]. Because heap allocation functions are optimized for occasional large memory allocations, the default allocator generally works well when allocating memory for containers that require a single large memory allocation at once, such as vectors and doubly-ended queues [8]. However, for associative containers and linked lists that frequently allocate small amounts of memory, using the default allocator typically results in low efficiency [4][9]. In addition, the malloc()-based default allocator also has many problems, such as poor reference locality [4], and may cause memory fragmentation [4][9].

In short, this section (…)(like) is a “Dream” speech for this standard regarding allocators. Before dreams come true, programmers concerned with portability will be limited to using stateless custom allocators.
— Scott Meyers, *Effective STL*

Given this, in this situation, people often use memory pool-based allocators to solve the problem of frequent small allocations [8]. Unlike the default “on-demand” allocation method, when using a memory pool-based allocator, the program pre-allocates large blocks of memory (i.e., &amp;quot;memory pool&amp;quot;) and then the custom allocator simply returns a pointer to an available memory location in the pool to the requester. When objects are destructed, it does not actually deallocate memory; instead, it is deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends [Note 1][8].

In the topic of “custom allocators,” many C++ experts and authors have participated in discussions, such as Scott Meyers’s *Effective STL* and Andrej Alexandrescu’s *Modern C++ Design*, which mention it. Meyers realized that if an allocator instance is required to be equal for a specific type T, the portable allocator instance must not contain state. Although the C++ standard encourages library implementers to support stateful allocators [Reference 4], Meyers said that this paragraph is “(seemingly) a wonderful view,” but it’s almost nonsense, and he considered the restrictions on allocators “too strict” [4]. For example, the list in STL allows the `splice` method, which means a node in one list object A can be directly moved into another list object B, which requires that the memory allocated by A&#39;s allocator be released by B&#39;s allocator, thus deducing that the allocator instances of A and B must be equal. Meyers’s conclusion is that allocators should be defined as types using static methods. For example, according to the C++ standard, the allocator must provide a `rebind` method other class template.

Furthermore, in *C++ Programming Language*, Bjørn Strubø suggests “‘restricting the allocator to avoid different information for each object’ is obviously not a problem” (roughly), and points out that most allocators do not need state, or even perform better without state. He proposed three use cases for custom allocators: memory pool-type allocators, shared memory-type allocators, and garbage collection-type allocators, and demonstrated an implementation of an allocator using an internal memory pool to quickly allocate/deallocate small amounts of memory [3]. However, he also mentioned that such optimization may already be implemented in the sample allocator he provided.

Another use for custom allocators is to debug memory-related errors [10]. To do this, you can write an allocator that allocates extra memory when allocating and stores debugging information. This type of allocator not only ensures that memory is allocated/deallocated by the same type of allocator, but also can protect the program to some extent from cache overflows [11].
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
