However, people are inherently greedy; if you buy too little, even when prices rise, you won’t make money; if you buy too much, you will lose money.</h5>

    <p>Reflecting on years of stock trading experiences, although I didn’t make a fortune, I also didn&rsquo;t lose too much. The biggest issue was an unreasonable allocation of funds and an unstable mindset. Currently, my primary source of income is work, earning a fixed salary each day through part-time jobs. My ability to withstand financial fluctuations remains at the level of bonds and bank deposits. However, people are inherently greedy; if you buy too little, even when prices rise, you won’t make money; if you buy too much, you will lose money. At this point, maintaining a stable mindset is particularly important, as it can help us keep our wealth afloat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prompt: Write an article: Addressing the mental issues in stock trading finance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="historical-loss-cases">Historical Loss Cases
</h2><p>Aside from the initial entry into the market, I encountered small-cap and near-new stocks. Later, I focused on blue-chip large-cap stocks: Industrial Bank, China Unicom, Hong Kong Electronics, ZTESC, and various large-stock index funds.</p>
<p>“Expected annualized returns were touted as matching a bank’s three-year fixed deposit,” but in reality, there was greed wanting more, leading to hasty increases from the beginning, followed by depletion of cash flow. Purchases of insurance, real estate, and weddings represented significant outflows of capital, resulting in insufficient liquidity overall, causing problems later on.</p>
<p>Investing in blue chips is like aligning with “old money”:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When Evergrande faced issues, bank stocks plummeted dramatically, successfully capitalizing on the washout phase. This reflects a lack of understanding regarding the economic impact of real estate, which accounts for a significant portion of China’s economy, and it was impossible to “force a landing.” The subsequent sustained decline in the stock market saw blue-chip stocks like Industrial Bank continue to rise for about two years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the initial stages of trade wars, ZTESC suffered severe damage, with its stock price also falling sharply. It has since gradually recovered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hong Kong Electronics, a long-standing company, experienced a significant drop in its stock price after Ant Financial’s departure, but this stock was manipulated by a major shareholder, allowing it to surge upwards several times per year. With reasonable position sizing, losses could be minimized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="greed-the-monster-that-devours-reason">Greed: The &ldquo;Monster&rdquo; That Devours Reason
</h2><p>Greed is the most common problem in a stock trading mindset. When stock prices rise steadily, and investors’ account profits continuously increase, greed quietly takes root. Many people still fantasize about continued price increases even when stocks are already at high levels, craving more gains and unwilling to cut their profits. They are blinded by greed, forgetting the laws of the market and the existence of risk. For example, during the hype of certain hot-themed stocks, some investors see prices double or even multiply within a short period, falling into it, constantly adding to their positions, hoping to be the last winner. However, the market will not always go crazy; when the bubble bursts and stock prices plummet sharply, these investors driven by greed often suffer heavy losses. Greed causes them to lose their ability to rationally analyze and make decisions, turning them into &ldquo;gamblers&rdquo; in the stock market rather than wise investors.</p>
<h2 id="fear-the-chain-that-restricts">Fear: The “Chain” That Restricts
</h2><p>Fear is the counterpart to greed. It possesses a powerful destructive force in the stock market as well. When market conditions suddenly plummet and stock prices fall sharply, investors are prone to panic. This fear erodes their confidence in the market, even when the fundamentals of their holdings are sound, leading them to hastily sell off their shares out of a fear of further losses. For example, during periods of global financial crises, even high-quality blue-chip stocks saw significant declines alongside the broader market. Some investors were consumed by fear and failed to recognize the long-term value of these companies, selling their stock at extremely low prices and missing out on substantial returns from subsequent market rebounds and company performance growth. Fear not only causes short-term losses for investors but can also create a lasting psychological shadow over the stock market, making them hesitant to re-enter, thus losing out on investment opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="blind-following-losing-direction-in-the-fog">Blind Following: Losing Direction in the &ldquo;Fog&rdquo;
</h2><p>In stock trading and wealth management, blindly following trends is another psychological pitfall that investors easily fall into. In an era of information explosion, various investment suggestions, market rumors, and hot topics are rampant. Many investors lack independent thinking and judgment abilities, blindly following others&rsquo; operations. When they see their peers making money by buying a particular stock, they immediately follow suit without further thought; when they hear so-called &ldquo;insider news,&rdquo; they readily share it. This blind following behavior ignores the research and analysis of the underlying stocks, causing investors to be like lost ships in the fog, losing their own direction. For example, some concept stocks can indeed generate short-term profits for followers during market hype. However, as the hype fades and stock prices plummet, those who are unaware and blindly follow will become &ldquo;cash absorbers.&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t realize that everyone’s risk tolerance, investment goals, and investment horizons are different, and a strategy suitable for others may not be suitable for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="overconfidence-the-hidden-shallow">Overconfidence: The Hidden &ldquo;Shallow&rdquo;
</h2><p>Overconfidence is also a significant issue in the investment and financial mindset. Some investors, after achieving several successful investments, begin to inflate their egos, believing they have mastered market patterns and can accurately predict stock movements. They ignore the complexity and uncertainty of the market, engage in excessive trading, blindly expand their investment scale, and even use high leverage for speculation. However, the market is ever-changing, and overconfident investors often suffer severe setbacks in a single unexpected market fluctuation. For example, some investors with limited experience who achieved an initial victory believe they possess professional investment capabilities and begin to frequently buy and sell stocks, constantly increasing their investment amount. When systemic risks or sudden negative news about individual stocks emerge, they fail to cut their losses promptly due to overconfidence, leading to a significant reduction in their principal capital. Overconfidence is like hidden reefs beneath the surface of the water – seemingly peaceful and harmless, but can unexpectedly cause an investor&rsquo;s wealth vessel to run aground.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-adjust-your-mindset-for-stable-financial-planning">How to Adjust Your Mindset for Stable Financial Planning
</h2><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Establish the Right Investment Philosophy:</strong> Investors should clearly understand that stock investing and wealth management are about achieving long-term, stable asset appreciation, not overnight riches. By learning investment knowledge, understanding market patterns, adopting value investing and long-term investment philosophies, and avoiding being swayed by short-term gains and market sentiment, you can make more informed decisions. For example, thoroughly research a company’s fundamentals, paying attention to its profitability, industry position, management team, and other relevant factors, choosing stocks with long-term investment potential rather than blindly chasing short-term trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Develop a Reasonable Investment Plan:</strong> Based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals, create a scientific and reasonable investment plan. Clearly define key elements such as investment amount, investment period, expected returns, and stop-loss points, and strictly execute the plan. This prevents impulsive decisions driven by emotional fluctuations during investing. For example, set the investment proportion of each stock to no more than a certain percentage of your total assets, and promptly take profits when the price rises to your expected return, and decisively cut losses when it falls to your stop-loss point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control Your Emotions and Stay Calm:</strong> When facing market volatility, learn to control your emotions and maintain calmness and rationality. You can relieve investment pressure through methods such as diverting attention, engaging in physical exercise, or communicating with others, avoiding negative impacts of emotions on investment decisions. When the market experiences significant fluctuations, first calmly analyze the reasons, combine your investment strategy and stock fundamentals, and make rational judgments instead of blindly following trends or panic selling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continue Learning and Reflecting:</strong> The stock market is constantly evolving, so investors need to continuously learn new investment knowledge and skills, pay attention to macroeconomic conditions, industry dynamics, and company information, and constantly improve their investment level. At the same time, regularly reflect on your investment behavior, summarize experiences and lessons, identify problems in your mindset and decision-making, and promptly adjust and improve them. For example, after each investment, review the entire investment process, analyze the reasons for success and failure, and think about how to avoid similar mistakes in future investments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wealth management is a long and challenging journey, and mindset plays a crucial role. Only by maintaining rational, calm, humble, and independent thinking can you steadily advance in the stock market’s waves and achieve wealth preservation and appreciation. Investors should consider cultivating their mindset as an essential course in the investment process, using a good mindset to steer the ship of wealth, and moving forward steadily on the path of stock investing and wealth management.</p>
