    <p>China&rsquo;s family planning policy, while limiting population growth, curbed familial development, disrupted traditional social structures, and suppressed the expansion of family businesses and political dynasties. Compared to South Korea’s chaebols and India’s family monopolies, its uniqueness is evident. Now that birth restrictions have been lifted, despite challenges like low birth rates, new monopoly risks must be guarded against, requiring a balance across various stakeholders.</p>
<h4 id="the-rise-and-fall-of-population-control-and-family-style-development">The Rise and Fall of Population Control and Family-Style Development
</h4><p>The family planning policy, a fundamental national policy in China for nearly forty years, has yielded significant results. Data shows that between 1978 and 2007, the natural population growth rate decreased from 12‰ to 5.2‰, reducing births by over 400 million, and China&rsquo;s share of the world population fell from 22.2% to 20.1%. This sharp decline in population growth has profoundly reshaped Chinese society’s family structure. For example, in family businesses, the number of children born to owners significantly decreased: birth rates of three or more children dropped from 40.63% before the policy to 18.46% afterward, while single-child births increased from 6.25% to 32.31%. This structural change has directly led to a substantial reduction in the pool of potential internal successors for family businesses, objectively inhibiting their ability to expand across generations.</p>
<p>Comparing South Korea and India, the differences are striking. Although South Korea has not implemented strict family planning policies, its birth rate has been persistently low (0.7 in 2023). However, chaebols maintain a firm grip on the national economy through cross-shareholdings and inheritance tax avoidance. The combined revenue of the five largest chaebols accounts for over 50% of South Korea&rsquo;s GDP, with Samsung alone contributing 20%. India presents a different picture: family businesses contribute 79% of economic output, and six conglomerates control key sectors like telecommunications and steel. Twenty top companies account for 80% of the profits earned by all enterprises nationwide. The core difference lies in China&rsquo;s family planning policy, which restricts family size and weakens the human resource base for family business expansion from the outset. Due to different policy environments, South Korea and India have allowed family influence to continuously permeate the economic sphere.</p>
<h4 id="restraining-monopolies-and-social-structure-transformation">Restraining Monopolies and Social Structure Transformation
</h4><p>The impact of the family planning policy on the economic sphere is particularly evident in its suppression of monopolies. Reduced daughter numbers have prevented Chinese family businesses from forming chaebol-like groups, similar to those in South Korea. For example, Korean chaebols maintain control through &ldquo;circular investment,&rdquo; with families like Samsung holding only 2% of shares but controlling everything through a complex equity structure. In China, family businesses after the implementation of family planning often face the challenge of “succession,” leading them to introduce professional managers or implement diversified shareholding reforms. A study by The Paper found that the proportion of female successors in family businesses increased from 13.85% to 34.21% following family planning, with a significant increase in their educational attainment – the percentage with bachelor&rsquo;s degrees or higher rising from 43.75% to 98.46%. While this transformation hasn’t completely eliminated family control, it has significantly reduced the possibility of monopolies dominated by single families.</p>
<p>At a societal level, the family planning policy accelerated the breakdown of the traditional family core model. Household size in China decreased from 4.41 people per household in 1982 to 2.62 in 2020, weakening the family&rsquo;s functions in areas such as economics, education, and social support. In contrast, India maintains a household size of around 4 people, with the caste system deeply intertwined with familial power, resulting in limited social mobility. The shift towards smaller families in China has created space for individualistic development; by 2023, there were 240 million single adults, and the consumption market is seeing the rise of a &ldquo;one-person economy,&rdquo; further diluting the influence of family economics.</p>
<h4 id="decentralization-of-power-in-the-political-sphere">Decentralization of power in the political sphere
</h4><p>The family planning policy has had a profound impact on the political landscape as well. Traditionally, familial influence permeated local politics through kinship and marriage ties. For example, in Xinyi County, Henan Province, 161 political families virtually controlled all government departments, with 20% of cadres at the deputy section level or above being &ldquo;second-generation officials.&rdquo; However, the implementation of the family planning policy reduced household size, limiting the expansion of familial networks. Research from Peking University shows that the number of children among officials decreased after the policy was implemented, leading to a significant decline in the complexity of political family networks. Furthermore, the policy promoted education (increasing average years of schooling from 5.2 in 1982 to 10.9 in 2023), fostering social mobility and weakening the monopoly of familial influence on political resources.</p>
<p>Comparing South Korea and India, the deep entanglement of Korean chaebols with politics (such as financial transactions between Samsung executives and the government) and the hereditary family politics under India&rsquo;s caste system highlight the uniqueness of Chinese policy. China’s birth planning policies have objectively reduced the possibility of power inheritance. While familial phenomena still exist in county-level politics, the overall trend is a dispersal of power structures. During the 2025 National People&rsquo;s Congress, a CPPCC member proposed renaming the &ldquo;Law on Population and Birth Planning&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Population and Fertility Law,&rdquo; fully relaxing birth restrictions – a move that could further influence the evolution of future political ecology.</p>
<h4 id="challenges-and-opportunities-after-policy-adjustments">Challenges and Opportunities After Policy Adjustments
</h4><p>The implementation of the two-child policy in 2016 and the three-child policy in 2021 marked a significant shift in China’s birth policies. However, the effects have been limited: the birth rate in 2022 was only 1.18, far below the replacement level (2.1). Relaxing birth restrictions has a dual impact on family businesses: some entrepreneurs may strengthen their ability to pass down their legacy through having more children, as exemplified by Zong Fuli of Wahaha Group succeeding her father; conversely, high childcare costs (averaging 1 million yuan to raise a child to 18 in first-tier cities) and declining willingness among working women to have children are restricting family expansion.</p>
<p>Releasing restrictions on childbirth could spur new monopolies in the economic sphere. The three-child policy is driving consolidation within industries like maternal and infant care, with the early childhood education market projected to reach 162.13 billion yuan by 2025. Leading companies are integrating smaller firms through mergers and acquisitions, resulting in a CR5 concentration exceeding 55%. While this consolidation may increase efficiency, it also poses monopolistic risks. The government must balance encouraging childbirth with preventing excessive market concentration – for example, strengthening antitrust regulation while providing childcare subsidies (such as the 3000 yuan monthly milk powder subsidy for families with three children in Hangzhou) to alleviate household burdens.</p>
<p>Easing birth restrictions may subtly impact family influence in the political sphere. While restoring traditional networks of familial politics is difficult in the short term, a rise in larger families could create new grassroots political influence over time. Therefore, refining cadre selection mechanisms and strengthening oversight (such as establishing rules to prevent relatives from holding positions) remain key to preventing power inheritance.</p>
<h4 id="international-lessons-and-future-prospects">International Lessons and Future Prospects
</h4><p>The experiences of South Korea and India demonstrate a close relationship between the rise and fall of family power and policy direction. South Korea achieved economic takeoff by supporting conglomerates (chaebols) but at the cost of social equity. India&rsquo;s lack of effective policies to curb family monopolies has exacerbated wealth inequality. China’s birth planning policy, while controlling population growth, objectively suppressed the expansion of family influence, but also brought about issues like accelerated aging and labor shortages.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, China needs to seek a new balance between population policy and socioeconomic development. This involves increasing birth rates through supportive policies (such as extended maternity leave and universal childcare facilities), while strengthening antitrust enforcement to prevent family businesses from forming new monopolies through financial operations. In the political sphere, further progress is needed in grassroots democracy construction, improving oversight mechanisms, and ensuring transparent governance.</p>
<p>Overall, the family planning policy, as a significant driver of social change in China, has had an impact far beyond the population sphere. It reshaped family structures, economic models, and the political landscape, providing a path for China to avoid falling into a Korean-Indian style trap of familial monopolies. As policies adjust, balancing efficiency with fairness, freedom with order within this new demographic context will be a long-term challenge for China.</p>
