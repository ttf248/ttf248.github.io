</h2><p>I said that in 10 years, I’d be a charming old man, and I would work hard to become a charming old man. The future of China will definitely have good old men and women. Even if I&rsquo;m 60 in 10 years, I’ll be the youngest in the world’s third-rate society.</p>
<p>To be honest, if everyone sees 50-year-old Chinese men with this physique, it would be pretty impressive. But behind this physique is a saying I believe: the more disciplined you are, the freer you become! When the rain stops, I want to go running; tomorrow afternoon I’ll play soccer. At 50 years old, I can still play big games – it&rsquo;s not a joke, and I often play with professionals. But what’s behind all of this? “Behind it is autonomy. The remaining days I spend running, and people might find that very monotonous. The more disciplined you are, the freer you become. Because of my discipline, I can run freely, never listening to music – because I feel my own breath is the most beautiful music while running.”</p>
<h2 id="transcript-1">Transcript
</h2><p>Additionally, I rarely run on the treadmill. Also, many people in Beijing experience smog as severe as that, so I run five days a week, with two days dedicated to the smog. And unlike others, I jokingly say it’s probably because I never stop. Each month, I record my runs in my journal – drawing one day for every day of experience, at least 18 days per month. When running, they just flash by; I don&rsquo;t even wear glasses while running, but more importantly, I still kick a ball every week. My graduate students’ last lecture was always held at our home—on the theme of “fun.” I find fun incredibly important, and I never engage with people who lack joy or hobbies.</p>
<ul>
<li>When I first started teaching a few years ago, one of my graduate students was featured in <em>China News Weekly</em>. We had a special issue called “Zhi” (致 – meaning “letter to”), and ten years later, when my student graduated each year, the final assignment he would complete was writing an article for me ten years down the line. I’d keep it, and then I’d gradually develop it with them as they progressed, including writing one myself at 50 for those turning 60 – something I never imagined happening so far away, beyond the map. But suddenly, it became my next stop: writing to 20-year-olds for 30-year-olds. That was a love letter written in spring, but my 50-year-old piece for 60 was more like summer’s farewell whispered to autumn – a private monologue. Now, I&rsquo;m writing to them ten years later, slowly constructing it from all over the world, as if crafting it for their own bed, a meal, and the presence of their family. This feels entirely natural.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="transcript-2">Transcript
</h2><p>But what kind of person will I be at 60 years old? My topic is very clear: In a pleasant introduction, this article is long. I say that in 10 years, I will be a lovable old man, and I want to work hard to become a lovable old man. China wanting to be lovable isn&rsquo;t just about having more like-minded citizens who become citizens, not just ordinary young people, energetic young people who understand the rules, young people who will make a good China in the future. Currently, over 60 million people in China have already exceeded 2.3 billion, and it will definitely exceed three billion within 10 years. That means that solely based on the population of those over 60, China could be among the top five or even third countries in the world. Think about how frightening that is!</p>
<p>I don’t feel that way myself. - I don’t know if everyone has seen the online table today listing the average lifespans of all provinces and municipalities in China. Shanghai and Beijing both exceed 80 years, including an average for both men and women. Naturally, men still have a significant disadvantage in terms of lifespan. That means that even if I&rsquo;m 60 years old in ten years, I’d be one of the youngest in this world. Looking ahead… If women retire at 55 and live another 25 years until an average age of 80, and men retire at 60 and live another 20 years until an average age of 80! You need to do something other than just dancing square dances. And I can say that the grandmothers and uncles who dance square dances today are cultural habits and entertainment methods brought about by the times.</p>
<h2 id="transcript-3">Transcript
</h2><p>Even in 20 years, the next generation may still have many people dancing square dances, but they will be significantly reduced. This is because the next generation are no longer active participants in collective activities, just like older generations who enjoy traveling in tour groups – now young people are increasingly choosing independent and self-guided travel. Square dancing will continue to exist in the future, but its scope will undoubtedly shrink; there’s neither good nor bad about this, it&rsquo;s simply a reshuffling of the times as it constantly evolves. When I was 60, I was one of the youngest members of the team. What kind of person should I be? The Chinese saying goes that 60 is when your ears become attuned – I believe I wouldn’t have listened to anything and been happy, even when I shouldn&rsquo;t have been, and even then I would have felt unhappy. More importantly, what should I do for the young people! What should we do for good things? - Not lazy, not easily compromising; it’s important to oppose when necessary. Young people could harm his interests – can you stand in front of them? I&rsquo;ve been constantly looking at this mirror lately. My good friend, Tao Wei, used to often gather with us, including at our home, and he once told me a genuine story. We collectively mourned together. The older generation, like Chen Lao Dai, kept everything stored within their homes, saying things out of the blue, hiding 30-odd items under the bed – you need to tell him that this garment cost over 500 yuan, and then we started supporting him financially, lighting incense every day. Therefore, this generation has grown accustomed to battling our parents for knowledge and wisdom; how much did a garment costing over 700 yuan cost?</p>
<h2 id="transcript-4">Transcript
</h2><ol start="220">
<li>But it’s easy to get into trouble. Tao Wei once bought a T-shirt for his dad for over 400 yuan. That T-shirt was really good, how much did it cost? “99,” I wore it. The next day, disaster struck. When he came back in the evening, he praised Tao Wei for taking a picture and giving him 400 yuan, asking him to buy four more for me. Afterwards, everyone who saw me wearing it, including Zhang and Li Da Ye, thought it was great, and then said that the risk of lying like this was very large. In the future, you shouldn’t do this. I don&rsquo;t specifically mention which person was in the orthopedic department of the hospital when an elderly person fractured a bone, and the most important reason was discovered – they bought shoes from a street stall. Of course, I’m only talking about this on a material level; even as we get older, we still need mental stimulation, curiosity, and a willingness to shield young people from the wind and rain, living each day happily.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m very curious and excitedly waiting for my 60th birthday to arrive, because I think it’s the beginning of a beautiful time.</p>
