    <p>The esports industry has experienced rapid development over the past decade and a half, becoming an increasingly significant cultural phenomenon worldwide. Particularly games like <em>League of Legends</em> (LoL), a MOBA title, have not only provided players with competitive enjoyment but also injected substantial momentum into capital investment, driving the flourishing development of various esports platforms and events. However, this all entered a phase of gradual decline alongside increased capital influx and the rise of the broader entertainment industry. The rise and fall of PandaTV, the competition between DouYu and Huya, marked the end of the “wild capitalism era,” and it seems that the favorable conditions – time, place, people, and heaven – for esports are also beginning to change.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-injection">Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Injection
</h2><p><strong>1.1 Early Esports: From Grassroots to Professionalization</strong>
The early esports industry started relatively grassroots, especially in the Chinese market. Many players participated in competitive games like <em>StarCraft</em> and Dota, driven by their love for gaming. However, the true rise of esports began with the release and promotion of <em>League of Legends</em>. Following the official entry of <em>League of Legends</em> into the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche community to part of mainstream culture. Notably, starting in 2013, the LPL (China Professional League) was established, and <em>League of Legends</em> became the cornerstone of China’s esports industry.
<strong>1.2 Capital Flood: The Rise of PandaTV and Esports Streaming Platforms</strong>
2015 marked a watershed moment for China&rsquo;s esports industry. The influx of capital transformed esports from purely competitive events into a much larger ecosystem. Pandahua (PandaTV), as one representative, became a product of excessive capital. Founded by Wang Sicong (one of the founders of PandaLive), Pandahua quickly rose to prominence with its innovative content and massive investment, attracting a large number of viewers and users. However, this was also a typical example of capital “barbaric” inflow – the market’s frantic pursuit of capital often lacks patience and foresight. Although Pandahua&rsquo;s financial and human resources achieved certain results in the short term, it ultimately collapsed in 2019 due to management issues and excessive reliance on capital fever.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Live Streaming Platform Competition: The “Capital War” between DouYu and Tiggy (虎牙)</strong></p>
<h2 id="chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-injection-1">Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Injection
</h2><p>The decline of PandaTV did not lead to a decline in the esports live streaming industry; instead, it fueled the rise of platforms like DouYu and Huya. The two major live streaming platforms quickly became leaders in the esports industry, with competition between them intensifying. DouYu initially established itself as a benchmark for esports live streaming through its broadcasts of professional <em>League of Legends</em> tournaments and by signing top streamers. Meanwhile, Huya gradually narrowed the gap with DouYu through increased investment in esports events and its own diversified platform layout.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, capital played a significant role once again. In 2018, DouYu successfully went public, and Huya also completed an IPO the same year. The rapid flow of capital led to industry consolidation and resulted in intense competition between platforms regarding streamers and copyrights, forming a “capital battle.”</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-the-fusion-of-mass-entertainment-and-esports">Chapter 2: The Fusion of Mass Entertainment and Esports
</h2><p><strong>2.1 The Trend Towards Mass Entertainment: Capital Flows into Diversified Entertainment Projects</strong></p>
<p>As capital has heavily invested in the esports industry, the content on esports platforms is gradually becoming mass-entertained. Esports anchors are no longer limited to match commentary and event live streaming; they have begun to expand into singing, dancing, interactive live streams, and other entertainment forms. The content on the platform is becoming more diverse, gradually forming an ecosystem centered around esports but also incorporating various entertainment elements.</p>
<p>However, mass entertainmentization has also brought problems – the original focus of esports culture has been marginalized, replaced by a trend of entertainment supremacy. This trend has caused some fans who originally loved esports culture to feel alienated, and capital is beginning to shift its attention to other entertainment fields. - Excessive capital influx and profit-seeking have gradually blurred the essence of the esports industry, with core values centered around competition weakening.
<strong>2.2 Rise of the General Entertainment Industry: Capital Withdrawal and Transformation</strong>
As short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and the entertainment industry (including K-pop) have risen, capital has gradually shifted from esports to a broader range of entertainment content. In this process, giants such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance no longer rely solely on esports projects for profit, but have increased their investments in areas such as film, music, and short videos.  In particular, the rise of ByteDance, through the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin (TikTok), has overshadowed esports with other entertainment content.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-three-league-of-legends-yellow-doesnt-follow-yellow-the-decline-of-the-eras-advantage">Chapter Three: League of Legends’ “Yellow Doesn&rsquo;t Follow Yellow”: The Decline of the Era’s Advantage
</h2><p>Since <em>League of Legends</em> entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has almost been synonymous with China’s esports industry, achieving countless professional players, teams, and events, and also spawning a massive esports ecosystem. However, after more than a decade, as a leading project in Chinese esports, <em>League of Legends</em> has entered a phase of “Yellow Doesn&rsquo;t Follow Yellow.” Particularly in recent years, the influence of <em>League of Legends</em> is gradually declining, even exhibiting obvious signs of decline.</p>
<p><strong>3.1 The &ldquo;Fracture&rdquo; in Player Demographics</strong></p>
<p>The most noticeable change is the fragmentation of player demographics. Initially, esports’ rapid development relied on the support of a large number of young players who became professional players or spectators thanks to <em>League of Legends</em>. That generation of internet addiction teenagers almost grew up under the “timeshare dividend.” They were immersed in the competitive appeal of League of Legends and, as a result, drove the rapid expansion of the entire industry. However, with the passage of time, these players gradually matured, entered society, and began to shift towards other life and career paths. Simultaneously, the interest of the new generation of young players in <em>League of Legends</em> was not as fervent as it once was, and the esports audience has developed a noticeable age bias and decline in interest.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-league-of-legends-yellow-never-follows-green-the-decline-of-the-eras-advantage">Chapter 3: League of Legends’ “Yellow Never Follows Green”: The Decline of the Era’s Advantage
</h2><p><strong>3.2 The “Stagnation” of Game Content</strong></p>
<p><em>League of Legends</em>, despite numerous updates and revisions, has begun to show a lack of fundamental innovation in its game content. Annual version releases, hero balance adjustments, and the introduction of new gameplay mechanics seem unable to fundamentally address players’ demand for novelty. Simultaneously, the MOBA market is becoming increasingly saturated, with other games (such as <em>Honor of Kings</em> and <em>PUBG Mobile</em>) rapidly rising in popularity and diverting a significant portion of the player base that was once dedicated to <em>League of Legends</em>. This competitive landscape has left <em>League of Legends</em> perpetually in the role of “chaser.”</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-where-does-the-esports-industry-go-from-here">Conclusion: Where Does the Esports Industry Go From Here?
</h2><p>The esports industry is like a skyscraper that sprung up seemingly overnight. Excessive capital roams within the internet industry, searching for the next big trend, and esports has become one of their targets. Leveraging China’s demographic dividend, the esports industry achieved tremendous success in a short period. However, this success wasn&rsquo;t built on a solid foundation. Over-investment by capital, talent shortages, and weak game content are all hindering the healthy development of the esports industry. Prior to university, I didn’t play many games, and the League of Legends was essentially a companion throughout my growth. I watched so many World Championships, and as an outsider, comparing Chinese and Korean players, especially Faker, domestic players always felt apprehensive and hesitant during major tournaments. I also understand that professional gamers face immense psychological pressure, but this industry has developed for over ten years, and their mental health issues should be prioritized by the teams – which they weren’t. Domestic gameplay still relies on individual player talent.</p>
