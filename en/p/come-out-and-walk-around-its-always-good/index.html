<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1
</h2><p>The results of the college entrance exam couldn’t be described as good or bad; I ended up graduating from a 211 university, and according to my father&rsquo;s initial plan, I should have studied power grids and returned to work for the local power supply bureau in our hometown. There had also been mentions earlier about how to step by step take this path into the IT industry – something that hadn’t been mentioned before: financial views and self-control.</p>
<p>I went to school in a rural town in elementary and middle school, and my family arranged for me to transfer to a school in the city district in middle school, much like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden; there was some initial difficulty adapting to the hustle and bustle of the city. I hadn’t been to a movie theater very often, to be precise, I hadn&rsquo;t gone to the movies with my parents, but relatives would take me. Heaven always gives you luck; back then, I met several friends who were just like me, although we lost contact later on, that period of my youth is now seen as beautiful. After catching up on tutoring over the weekend, we’d gather to tidy up the classroom, expertly kicking flattened plastic bottles into our backpacks to take back to Mom for storage. As they accumulated, we&rsquo;d find a waste collector to handle them. We’d play chess, badminton, and Mahjong – if I lost, I’d do a few push-ups; it was a small consolation at the time. Dad had been taking me through all sorts of exercises since I was little. At this point, my understanding of money was slightly skewed, and I felt a bit insecure, but these minor setbacks quickly passed. Our family wasn&rsquo;t struggling – we simply didn’t have much pocket money, and sometimes couldn’t join our classmates in their activities, especially on weekends. Seeing our parents’ efforts as we moved from the village to the city… it was like planting a seed, waiting for it to sprout.</p>

</h2><blockquote>
<p>As a simple-minded individual, I found my time studying to be generally very happy, much like many people can only truly appreciate after graduating – reading isn’t actually that difficult of a task, and the conversion of investment into output is relatively easy.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-one-1">Chapter One
</h2><p>Growing up, I absorbed the memories of the Age of Empires era. During university, encountering a laptop was like opening Pandora’s Box – I discovered games and connected with game merchants. Initially, I was a low-level salesperson, sourcing goods upstream and selling them through my own community channels to earn a little money. Later, I gradually understood the operational logic of the entire chain. The products we sold were merely mass-produced by upstream programs, and their costs approached zero. At this time, the road had already started to slant a bit. Within the field of expertise, there were increasingly specialized sub-disciplines: on the left was power grids, and on the right was automation (very complex – chip programming, factory electrical automation). I understood that programs could make money, but it wasn’t a huge sum; the upstream channels definitely made a lot of money. Adding to this my previous foundation in programming, I started experimenting with various things, making a little money here and there. When the time came for specialization, I naturally chose automation. After completing most of my senior-level courses, many of which I didn’t attend, I was constantly thinking about writing code to make money.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s article mentioned a fascination with hackers, leading me to contact programming. Without formal training in IT, I used compassion to learn assembly language, penetration testing, game cheats, DLL hijacking, and phishing – familiarizing myself with various black-hat and gray-hat products. My parents taught me how to be a good person, which ultimately dissuaded me from completely straying down the wrong path.</p>

</h2><p>Previous Post Link: <a class="link" href="/en/p/then-boy-talent-not-much/" >That Time When I Was Young</a></p>
<p>I had a brief relationship during university. Looking back, it was more about yearning for the romance depicted in television dramas. As an immature young man at the time, I couldn&rsquo;t understand how to love someone, let alone achieve: settling down and starting a family.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-two">Chapter Two
</h2><p>Amidst the torrent of times, I was fortunate – university’s tribulations led me to a direct entry into employment rather than graduate school. Upon graduation, I joined the workforce, riding the wave of IT’s prosperity with smooth and steady progress. Now in my eighth year of work, the industry&rsquo;s speculative heat dissipated, inevitably leading to decline. Sometimes, I question whether my initial choice was correct; perhaps entering a utility company as suggested by my father would have been a better path. If these thoughts were prevalent during the first five years of my career, they gradually faded away with time. Through campus recruitment, I joined HSBC, remaining with the same company for five years without switching roles. This has resulted in certain deficiencies regarding technological understanding, industry knowledge, and self-awareness of one’s capabilities. Following the arrangement of the headquarters in Hangzhou, I went to the Shenzhen branch, experiencing a workplace struggle (after clarifying the situation, both sides lost out, and the board of directors ultimately benefited), returning to Hangzhou with a passion for technology, carrying a touch of youthful naiveté, having run off to Shanghai.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originally planned to settle down in Hangzhou, purchase property, and register, at the highest interest rates and peak housing prices, it was intended to be a trap – my finances were limited and I couldn’t afford it. If I had been burdened with mortgage payments while the industry was declining, my emotions would have become unstable.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="chapter-three">Chapter Three
</h2><p>Having been around for so many years, having seen so much, I’ve made my own mistakes and wasted time, and currently, things are still going well. Experiencing things, experiencing people – it all leads to gradual growth. If you were to stay at home constantly, I wonder what form the flaws in my personality would manifest themselves in.</p>
