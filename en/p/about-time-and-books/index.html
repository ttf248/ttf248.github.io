    <p>In general, the country is getting better and stronger economically, becoming wealthier. This wouldn’t be true without the diminishing of personal vanity. Looking back from the 1990s to now, in the families I&rsquo;ve encountered, people’s lives have generally improved significantly. Simultaneously, the number of wealthy individuals has increased. During the development of market-oriented economics, it is unavoidable that wealth gaps have widened.</p>
<p>Commonly discussed phenomena like class solidification and blocked upward mobility are global trends. The Communist Party’s contributions to basic welfare benefits and social security should also be noted. Things will get better and better, you don’t need to buy a house; you can rent one. Children&rsquo;s education also faces issues with unequal resource allocation, sometimes requiring compromises – do you want better job opportunities, a better work environment, or more time to spend with family? Don’t impose your own ideas on others, including your child and family members. Sit down and talk it over; life will inevitably get better.</p>

<p>I’m now 50 years old this year, and I didn&rsquo;t think about it in the past. I felt like an old man. Now I realize that I really am an old man. This is what I looked like at 30. When you’re 30, you don’t feel very young or beautiful, but when you look back at 50, it&rsquo;s actually pretty good. What was the biggest life lesson at 30? Looking back. I think it’s subtraction – the key word is subtraction.  Some pain and happiness are also a kind of subtraction; you want to experience and write down many things, then leave them there, on a new blank sheet, or go for a run. But for me, at 30, I really feel that whether it&rsquo;s for myself or for others, doing subtraction is very important. I’m currently a student carrying heavy loads – I often remind them, “Before you turn 30, you need to be adding relentlessly, trying things out; you don&rsquo;t know what kind of possibilities you have, and you don&rsquo;t know what opportunities fate will offer.” So it’s not about knowing, but some people are working tirelessly in their twenties, constantly adding, but they forget to subtract when they reach a certain point. I think around 30 is a very important time in life – after doing a series of additions and wandering around everywhere, you should take the time to subtract; otherwise, it’s too late. Why do you need to subtract? Not everything suits you, and not everything is suitable for you. You should try to do everything.
Eight lines are tethering you – how far can you run? They might hinder each other.

<h2 id="thirty-years-old-1">Thirty Years Old
</h2><p>At thirty years old, I had been promoted to a full professorship – in academic terms. For journalism, it’s equivalent to a senior reporter. I was promoted to a full professorship at 29, and such promotions have become rare these days. However, at that time, I began to feel a tremendous sense of confusion. When the Sydney Olympics were held in 2000, I received a lot of applause, but suddenly I realized something wasn’t right. I started asking myself, “What exactly do you want to do? What things need to be discarded?” That year, I made a very important subtraction – I stopped my show and didn&rsquo;t appear on television for a year, without any external appearances. People told me that as a host, you can get by if you don’t appear on screen for a month, but if you don’t appear for six months, no one will remember you. I said, “My face is quite valuable.” That year, I began to develop new programs. “This was after going through immense pain and joy, and in 2001, I stopped for an entire year. Everything I’m doing today is a reflection of that time – a process of simplification (doing less). Back then, I could do so much: I could pursue sports, I could get into E [likely referring to electronic music/entertainment], and many other fun things, even produce shows. But I said no. I realized I could only do journalism, and it was what I was truly meant to do. At the time, I was producing three segments, and I quit them all overnight, which led to who I am today. I became simpler. A few days ago, talking with colleagues, I even mentioned how a very important decision I made when I was in my thirties – not just because of all the opportunities available, but because I felt that I should simply stick to journalism, and this deep well [likely referring to dedication to the profession]… many positions could have promoted me to deputy director. I rejected it, and returned to a common citizen’s level.”</p>

<p>To date, I’ve been working with provincial-level cadres and party officials, none of whom are exclusively graduates of undergraduate programs – they aren&rsquo;t all solely from bachelor&rsquo;s degrees among the masses. You understand our system, but I refuse to participate. I wanted to see how far a bachelor’s degree could take someone, and why a bachelor’s degree shouldn’t be limited to continuous learning and mentoring graduate students. Yes, I currently mentor 11 graduate students per year – this is a reduction in numbers. I think it&rsquo;s a reflection on that feeling of looking back. Furthermore, when you&rsquo;re young, you easily develop a sense of entitlement: “Everything I deserve, if something isn’t received, if something has a flaw, I feel particularly uncomfortable.” Please don’t any of you learn to cut corners either – that is, at the time when you’re about to turn 30 or 28 years old, watching the 1996 Olympics, I came up with a sentence: “Defects are an important part of perfection; there is no perfect world.” In Zeng Qianfen&rsquo;s long novel, it actually wrote down a very important saying: what is the best state in life? Zeng Qianfen wanted to name his study room &ldquo;Qiu Que Ting&rdquo; – the flower hasn’t fully bloomed yet is the best. The moon hasn’t been completely round yet is the best. But for ordinary people, they will feel this is a defect, not perfect enough, not reaching the extreme, and the best way to ruin someone is to let them pursue perfection and reach the extreme.</p>

<h2 id="thirty-years-old-3">Thirty Years Old
</h2><p>This world isn’t like that. Flowers are most beautiful when they aren&rsquo;t fully open; once they bloom completely, they’re close to falling. The moon is most beautiful when it’s full and round; as it slowly transforms into a waning crescent, it’s also approaching that point. Therefore, I feel this was a very important boost and revelation for me at 30. Forty isn&rsquo;t as good-looking as that time. But I think I relaxed, became freer. Why shouldn’t I start asking about happiness instead of dressing in suits and ties or always looking formal?</p>

<p>Chinese people have a saying that 40 is not confused; 30 is subtraction, and 40 is confusion. It’s not about being unconfused, and I think in today&rsquo;s era, 40-year-olds are the most confused. My midlife crisis came surprisingly early, starting around 36 or 37 years old when I began to question whether everything I had done was valuable and meaningful. What do I really want for happiness? This book was born out of this confusion. When you&rsquo;re 30, you often find that your happiness goals are tied to material possessions. “Thirty and established” (三十而立) refers to having a solid education. You need a car, a house, otherwise your mother-in-law won’t consider marrying you off – it’s very materialistic, but 40 is difficult to be unconfused. I think ancient people likely had a longer average lifespan than we do now, so when they condensed it to 40 years, he wouldn’t be confused. I feel that way myself – at 40, I&rsquo;m bewildered. <strong>Material things haven&rsquo;t brought me happiness as I thought they would.</strong> Similarly, when people ask you at 40, “Are you happy?” it’s often a question mark, representing the confusion within my heart. The emergence of midlife crisis: at 40, you need to answer yourself many questions, you need to talk to yourself more at around 40, you need to read a lot and give yourself some answers. I was very fortunate to have entered the world of the <em>Tao Te Ching</em> when I was thirty-six or seventy years old. In <em>White Say</em>, I had already discussed it, and at forty years old, when one is still contemplating things, if the surrounding environment doesn’t change, especially the soft environment – if you’re feeling relaxed and happy enough to step out of the house and wander around freely, like running through red lights – you’ll find that everything you buy is fake, and even getting a vaccine.</p>
<h2 id="forty-years-old-1">Forty Years Old
</h2><p>I’ve been saying that China has been battling two typhoons these past few days – one typhoon was intangible, and the other was tangible. The intangible typhoon is vaccines; it’s attacking our inner security dam. The other typhoon, China rarely sees typhoons landing in Shanghai – that&rsquo;s a distraction. Next, you need to think about whether you are only focusing on your own well-being, if you’ve undergone significant changes, and if you have many answers. If the surrounding environment doesn’t change, will you be happy? <strong>I have eight characters I say are quite heavy – I feel that we currently suffer from a moral deficit and a loss of humanity; this is the biggest deficit and greatest loss.</strong> A few days ago, I witnessed a car accident not far from here. It wasn&rsquo;t that serious of a collision, and he was responsible for hitting another vehicle. He tried to explain to the other driver that we were planning to pull over to the side of the road, and the other driver slowly began preparing to do so. However, the lead vehicle sped off without stopping to help. There weren’t any people in it trying to restrain him.</p>
<p>Would that be a responsible father? Would that be a responsible son? And what about his responsibility as a citizen – it inevitably impacts you. You might be a big shot, but unless you haven&rsquo;t stepped foot outside your home, it doesn&rsquo;t prevent your children from getting vaccinated. Even delivery services can have issues!</p>
<h2 id="forty-years-old-2">Forty Years Old
</h2><p>If 30 is subtraction and 40 is confusion, I think 50 should be the word I give myself: curiosity. Fifty is awkward; neither forward nor backward has a village or shop to reach – advance, attack; retreat, blend in – it can also work. Spending ten years on something you’ve achieved, lingering until retirement, seems possible.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been reading a book that contains some very interesting writing: it says that truly successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are often older, 50s and 60s. This is different from our concept. How can China ever stop viewing entrepreneurship as a young endeavor, just like how China shouldn’t view volunteers as youth volunteers? Last week I did a program about China recruiting retired primary and secondary school teachers – with an annual stipend of two or three hundred thousand yuan – to teach in rural areas, and they must be outstanding.</p>

></p>
<p>More importantly, for a 50-year-old person, there are two challenges: the first is yourself – are you still curious about many things? What is your worldview? I feel that my biggest gain at 50, or the way I’m living now, is to treat every day well. When you&rsquo;re 20 years old, it&rsquo;s easy to live in tomorrow; if you&rsquo;re not careful, a 50-year-old tends to dwell on yesterday. But I try to restrain myself, neither living in tomorrow nor in the past. I treat each day well – a 50-year-old shouldn’t always say “we’ll talk about it tomorrow” or “things were better back then!”</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s best to watch Cai Qin’s concert discs today. Cai Qin said something that was quite profound: whenever he looks at old photos, he thinks he looked good two years ago. But on that particular day two years ago, he never thought he looked good before. That’s a really flavorful saying. “I didn’t realize it when I was 30, at that time I felt quite handsome. I thought I had a lot of flaws, but now, when I look back after 20 years, I realize… I was young once too. I had so much hair then, so cherish every day you have, and it would be best to see how you are two years from now.”</p>
<h2 id="fifty-years-old-1">Fifty Years Old
</h2><blockquote>
<p>As Yu Shi-sheng said, when my legs first couldn’t walk, I sat in a wheelchair, constantly yearning for the time when I could run and play basketball. Every day, consumed by these memories, I was incredibly painful.
Years later, I developed bedsores on my wheelchair and felt all over the body ache. At that time, I constantly reminisced about the days when just a few years ago, I didn’t feel any pain, and could spend peaceful moments sitting in a wheelchair.
After even more years, I was diagnosed with uremia, and I had to go for dialysis. At this point, I would always yearn for the time when I only had bedsores on my wheelchair. If I couldn&rsquo;t live to reach a state where every day was treated kindly, those next 50 years would have been wasted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fifty-years-old-2">Fifty Years Old
</h2><p>I actually feel that you shouldn’t wait until 50 to understand this principle; it should be understood in your 30s or 40s, because all things are easily missed if you wait. Like a meal during a trip – if you don&rsquo;t eat it, you can still have it 30 years later, and it might not even taste the same. So I think treating every today is my first feeling at 50.</p>
<p>The second thing is curiosity. I’ve realized that I can stop being curious about many things at any time because I&rsquo;ve seen so much and experienced so much, but I encourage myself to remain curious. Therefore, when doing a lot of things now, I approach them with a sense of curiosity – whether a phone can be held vertically to take pictures, it can; whether you can do live reporting, whether you can attend seemingly large and very formal events, can you make the connection easier? It’s more fun and more impressive for everyone. And how can you then use new media to spread the word? All of this is possible. I believe curiosity is the most important driving force for human progress, and why can’t it be the most important driver for individual advancement? A nation that loses its curiosity is doomed. On a broader level, 50 is a crucial test. When you&rsquo;re in your fifties in China, what kind of entrenched interests do you hold? I’m very concerned that many people around me pursue countless dreams when they’re young because of their aspirations, but once they achieve those dreams and become entrenched beneficiaries, they transform into those who obstruct others from realizing their own. Am I right? Looking back, they treat young people and matters in the way they used to dislike most.</p>
<h2 id="fifty-years-old-3">Fifty Years Old
</h2><p>Therefore, a few years ago I started recruiting 11 graduate students each year as volunteers, and after spending two years with them, they have now all graduated. There are five graduating classes, totaling 55 pure graduate students who have already finished their studies. I think it’s a very happy thing to create such a system – you gain some experience, and you have the ability to guide them. After each day of class, I invite them for dinner, which doesn&rsquo;t cost much. However, this is what a good vested interest should do – a vested interest can be two aspects: one is to become paving stones again. I once said that I don’t want to say thank you too much to those who have helped me, because I want to treat new young people ten times over. This is the way I express my gratitude.
<strong>If you constantly say “thank you” and become a blocker…</strong> The next thing is to pave the road for others. I hope that, no matter whether it’s material, economic, ideological, or cultural – across all fields – when you become a vested interest group in China, you will consider how you should act. Yesterday’s pusher of the train has become today’s person blocking the train; looking back at Chinese history, this is everywhere. It won&rsquo;t be like that; sometimes it even becomes more so. Therefore, I call on all vested interests to return to the way they were when they were young – to act as they wished to encounter such people. Even if I may not do well in that role, I at least want to think about it, do it, and speak about it.</p>
