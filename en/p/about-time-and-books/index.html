    <p>Overall, the country is getting better and stronger economically, becoming wealthier. If people’s vanity didn&rsquo;t exist, this wouldn&rsquo;t be the case. Looking back from the 1990s to now, in the families I’ve encountered, everyone’s lives have improved significantly compared to before, and at the same time, the number of wealthy individuals has increased. During the development of market-oriented economic growth, wealth inequality inevitably emerged.</p>
<p>What is often talked about – class solidification and a blocked upward mobility path – are common problems worldwide. The Communist Party&rsquo;s contributions to people’s basic welfare benefits and social security should be recognized. Things will get better and better, you don’t need to buy a house; you can rent one. Children&rsquo;s education also faces issues with unequal resource allocation, sometimes requiring compromises – do you want better job opportunities, a better work environment, or more time to spend with family? Don’t impose your own ideas on others, including your child and family members. Sit down and talk it over; life will inevitably get better.</p>

<p>I’m now 50 years old this year, and I didn&rsquo;t think about it in the past. I felt like an old man. Now I realize that I really am an old man. This is what I looked like at 30. When you’re 30, you don’t feel very young or beautiful, but when you look back at 50, you think it&rsquo;s pretty good. What was the biggest life lesson at 30 when you look back? I think it’s subtraction – the key word is subtraction. From a certain perspective, “pain and joy” is also a kind of subtraction; you experience and write down many things, then leave them there, on a new blank sheet, or go for a run. But for me, at 30, I really think that whether it’s for myself or for everyone else, doing subtraction is very important. I’m currently a student carrying heavy loads – I often remind them, “Before you turn 30, you need to be relentlessly adding; you need to try things; you don&rsquo;t know what kind of possibilities are out there, and you don’t know what opportunities fate will give you.” So it’s not about knowing how you feel, but some people are frantically adding in their twenties, all sorts of additions, but they forget to subtract when it’s time; I think around 30 is a very important time in life – after doing a series of additions and running around everywhere, you need to do an important subtraction. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s too late. Why would you subtract? You aren’t suited for everything, and you aren’t suited for what others are suited for; you should try everything.
Eight lines are tying you up – how far can you run? They might hinder each other.

<h2 id="thirty-years-old-1">Thirty Years Old
</h2><p>At thirty years old, I had been promoted to a full professorship – that’s what they called it academically, while journalists referred to it as a senior journalist. I was promoted to a full professorship at twenty-nine, and such promotions have become rare these days. However, at that time, I began to feel a tremendous sense of confusion. When the Sydney Olympics were held in 2000, I received many accolades, but I suddenly realized that something wasn’t right. I started asking myself, “What exactly do you want to do? What things need to be discarded?” That year, I made a very important subtraction – I stopped my show and didn&rsquo;t appear for a year, without any public appearances. People told me, &ldquo;As a host, you can get by if you don’t appear on screen for a month; if you don’t appear for six months, no one will remember you.” But I said, “My face is quite valuable.” That year, I began to develop new programs. “This was after going through immense pain and joy, and in 2001, I stopped for an entire year. Everything I’m doing today is a reflection of that time – a process of simplification. Back then, I could do so many things: I could play sports, I could get into E (presumably referring to electronic music or entertainment), and countless other fun activities, even producing shows. But I said no, and I realized I could only do journalism. And it was what I was truly meant to do. At the time, I was the producer of three programs, and I quit them all overnight. That’s how I became who I am today. I became simpler. A few days ago, talking to a colleague, I said that at around 30 years old, one of my most important decisions wasn&rsquo;t just about having many options, but the feeling that I was meant to be solely focused on journalism – this deep well, with numerous positions potentially offering you a promotion to deputy director. I rejected it and returned to a common citizen’s level.”</p>

<p>To date, I’ve been working with provincial-level cadres and even party officials – none of whom were exclusively graduates of undergraduate programs. You understand our system, but I refuse to participate. I wanted to see how far a bachelor&rsquo;s degree could take someone, and why a bachelor&rsquo;s degree shouldn’t be limited to continuous learning and potentially mentoring graduate students. Yes, I currently mentor 11 graduate students per year – this is a reduction in numbers. It’s certainly a feeling of reflection looking back. Furthermore, when you’re young, it’s easy to feel that everything should be perfect; if something isn&rsquo;t achieved or has a flaw, it causes me great discomfort. Please don’t have everyone seated also learn how to subtract, that is, at that time when you are 28 or 30 years old, watching the 1996 Olympics, I came up with a sentence: “Defects are an important part of perfection; there is no perfect world.” In Zeng Qianfan’s long novel, it actually wrote down a very important sentence: what is the best state of life? Zeng Qianfan wanted to name his study room “Que Hall,” and the flowers hadn&rsquo;t fully bloomed yet was the best. The moon wasn&rsquo;t yet full was the best, but for ordinary people, they would all feel that it was a defect, not perfect enough, not reaching the extreme, the best way to ruin someone is to let them pursue perfection and reach the extreme.</p>

<h2 id="thirty-years-old-3">Thirty Years Old
</h2><p>This world isn’t like that. Flowers are most beautiful when they aren&rsquo;t fully open; once they do, they’re close to falling. The moon is most beautiful when it’s full and round, but as it slowly fades into a crescent moon, it’s also approaching that point. Therefore, I feel this was a very important boost and revelation for me at 30. Forty isn&rsquo;t as attractive as it was then. But I felt relaxed, freer. Why shouldn’t I start asking about happiness instead of dressing in suits and ties or always looking formal?</p>

<p>Chinese people have a saying that 40 is not confused; 30 is subtraction, and 40 is confusion. I don’t think the current era sees 40 as the most confused. My midlife crisis came surprisingly early, starting around thirty-six or seventy, when I began to question whether everything I had done was worthwhile?</p>
<p>Did it have meaning? What do I truly want for happiness? This book was born out of this confusion. When you’re 30, you often find that your happiness goals are linked to material possessions. “Thirty and established” refers to having a degree. You need a car, a house, or otherwise your mother-in-law won&rsquo;t consider marrying you off – it’s very materialistic, but &ldquo;40 is not confused&rdquo; is difficult. - I think ancient people likely had a longer average lifespan than we do today, so it was condensed into 40 years, which is why they weren’t confused. I feel that I’m confused at 40, <strong>material things haven&rsquo;t brought me happiness as I thought they would.</strong> Similarly, when people ask you around 40, “Are you happy?” the title of my book is a question mark – it represents the confusion within me. The emergence of midlife crisis: at 40, you need to answer yourself many questions, talk to yourself more often at around 40, read a lot, and give yourself some answers. I’m very glad that I entered the world of the <em>Tao Te Ching</em> when I was thirty-six or seventy. In <em>White Say</em>, I already discussed it, and if you’re still thinking about things at forty years old, and the surrounding environment doesn&rsquo;t change – especially the soft environment – if you can walk out of the house in a good mood and find yourself randomly running red lights, then anything you buy is fake, and even getting vaccinated.</p>
<h2 id="forty-years-old-1">Forty Years Old
</h2><p>I’ve been saying that China has been battling two typhoons these past few days – one was intangible, and the other was tangible. The intangible typhoon is vaccines; it’s attacking our inner security dam. The other typhoon, China rarely sees typhoons landing in Shanghai – that&rsquo;s a digression. Next, you need to think about whether you’re just focusing on your own well-being, if you’ve undergone significant changes, and if you have many answers. If the surrounding environment doesn’t change, will you be happy? <strong>I have eight characters I say are quite heavy – I feel that we currently suffer from a moral deficit and a loss of humanity; this is the biggest deficit and the greatest loss.</strong> A few days ago, I witnessed a head-on collision not far from here. Thankfully, the damage wasn&rsquo;t severe; it was responsible, because he hit another car. He explained to the other driver that we were planning to pull over to the side of the road, and the other driver slowly began preparing to do so. The vehicle in front took off without stopping him. There wasn’t anyone to restrain him.</p>
<p>Would this be a responsible father? Would this be a responsible son? And what about his responsibility as a citizen – it inevitably impacts you. You might be a big shot, but unless you haven&rsquo;t stepped foot outside your door, it doesn&rsquo;t prevent your child from getting vaccinated. Even delivery services can have issues!</p>
<h2 id="forty-years-old-2">Forty Years Old
</h2><p>If 30 is subtraction and 40 is confusion, I think 50 should be the word I give myself: curiosity. 50 is awkward; neither village nor town to reach, advanceable; retreat, you can also mix it in, perhaps until retirement. Lying on something you’ve achieved for ten years, blending through to retirement, seems possible.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been reading a book, and one of the books within it wrote very interestingly that truly successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley tend to be in their fifties and sixties – which is different from our concept. How can China ever stop treating entrepreneurship as a young endeavor, just like how China shouldn’t treat volunteer work as youth volunteer work. Last week I did a program about China recruiting retired primary and secondary school teachers, with an annual allowance of two or three hundred thousand yuan, and then going to rural areas to teach, and must be excellent.</p>

></p>
<p>More importantly, for a 50-year-old person, there are two challenges: the first is yourself – are you still curious about many things? What is your outlook on life? I feel that my biggest gain at 50, or the way I’m living now, is to treat every today well. Twenty years old tends to live in tomorrow; if you&rsquo;re not careful, a 50-year-old easily lives in yesterday. But I try to restrain myself, neither living in tomorrow nor in yesterday. I treat every today well – a 50-year-old shouldn’t always say “we’ll do it tomorrow” or “it was better back then!”</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s best to watch Cai Qin’s concert discs today. Cai Qin said something quite profound, saying that whenever I look at photos, I feel like I looked good two years ago. But on that particular day two years ago, I never thought I looked good before. That’s a really flavorful sentence. “I didn’t realize it when I was 30, back then I thought I looked pretty good. I felt like I had a lot of flaws, but now that I look back 20 years later, I realize… I was young once too. I had so much hair, so cherish every day you have, and it would be best if you looked at your current state two years from now.”</p>
<h2 id="fifty-years-old-1">Fifty Years Old
</h2><blockquote>
<p>As Yu Shi-sheng said, when my legs first couldn’t walk, I sat in a wheelchair, constantly yearning for the time when I could run and play basketball. Every day, filled with longing, it was incredibly painful.
Several years later, I developed bedsores on my wheelchair and felt all over pain. At that time, I constantly yearned for the days when just a few years ago, I didn’t feel any pain, and had peaceful moments sitting in a wheelchair.
After another period of time, I was diagnosed with uremia, and I had to go dialysis. At this point, I would always yearn for the time when I only had bedsores on my wheelchair. If I couldn&rsquo;t live to reach a state where every day was treated well, those 50 years ahead would have been wasted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fifty-years-old-2">Fifty Years Old
</h2><p>I actually feel that it’s pointless to wait until 50 to understand this principle – you should grasp it in your 30s or 40s, because all things are easily missed if you wait. Like a meal during a trip; if you don&rsquo;t eat it, you can still have it thirty years later, and it might not even taste the same. That’s why my first feeling at 50 is to be kind to every day.</p>
<p>Secondly, I’ve realized that I can stop being curious about many things because I’ve seen so much and had so many experiences. However, I encourage myself to remain curious. So when I do a lot of things now, I approach them with a sense of curiosity – can you hold your phone up to take pictures? Yes, you can. Can you do live reporting, attend seemingly grand and formal conferences, and make the connection easier? It’s more fun, and it leaves a more lasting impression. Can you then use new media to spread the word? Absolutely. “I believe curiosity is the most important driving force for human progress, and why can’t it be the most important driver for individual advancement? A nation that loses its curiosity will inevitably decline. On a broader level, 50 is a crucial test. When you&rsquo;re in your fifties in China, what kind of entrenched interests do you hold? I’m very concerned that many people around me pursue countless dreams when they’re young because of hope, but once they achieve their dreams and become entrenched beneficiaries, they transform into those who block others from realizing their dreams – am I wrong? Looking back, they treat young people and matters in the way they used to dislike.”</p>
<h2 id="fifty-years-old-3">Fifty Years Old
</h2><p>Therefore, a few years ago I started recruiting 11 graduate students each year as volunteers, and after they spent two years with me, they had already graduated five classes, totaling 55 pure graduate students who have now completed their studies. I think it’s a very happy thing to be a beneficial figure like this – you gain some insights, and you also have the ability to guide them. After each day of class, I invite them for dinner, which doesn&rsquo;t cost much. However, this is what a good benefactor should do – a benefactor can be two aspects: one is to become a paving stone again. I once said that I don’t want to say thank you too often to those who have helped me, because I want to reciprocate with new young people in double the way. That&rsquo;s how I express my gratitude.
<strong>If you constantly say “thank you” and end up becoming a roadblock.</strong> The next is to pave the road for others. “I hope that in China, regardless of whether it’s material interests, economic power, ideological dominance, or cultural influence – across all fields – when you find yourself in that position as a vested interest holder, you will consider how you should act. Yesterday’s pusher of the train has become today’s roadblock; looking back at Chinese history, this is everywhere. It won&rsquo;t be like this, and sometimes it can even be amplified. Therefore, I call on all vested interests to return to the mindset of when you were young – to emulate the kind of people you hoped to encounter then. Even if that person I might not be as good, at least I’m thinking, doing, and speaking about it.”</p>
