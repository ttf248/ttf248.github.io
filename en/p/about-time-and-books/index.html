    <p>Overall, the country is becoming better and stronger. If people could curb their vanity, things would be even better. Looking back from the 1990s to now, the lives of families I&rsquo;ve interacted with have improved significantly. There are also more wealthy individuals. In the development of a market economy, widening income inequality is unavoidable.</p>
<p>The issues of social stratification and blocked upward mobility are common problems in today&rsquo;s world. Our party’s contributions to the basic welfare and social security of the people should be recognized. Life will continue to improve; if you don&rsquo;t want to buy a house, you can rent. Educational resource allocation is unequal, sometimes requiring choices. Decide what matters most – better job opportunities/environment or more time with family – and don’t impose your own preferences on others, including your children and family. Sit down and talk it over; life will generally get better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve turned 50 this year. I never thought about it before, but now I realize I really am an old guy. This is what I looked like at 30. Didn’t feel particularly young or handsome then, but looking back at 30 now, not bad! What was the biggest life lesson at 30? Looking back. I think it&rsquo;s subtraction – the keyword is subtraction. In a way, experiencing and writing about things while feeling both pain and joy is also a form of subtraction, leaving those experiences behind to start fresh on a new blank page, like running. But for me, doing subtraction—whether for myself or as a reminder to others—was truly important at 30.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently guiding students at Peking University, and I often tell them to focus on building their skills and experiences—the &ldquo;additions&rdquo;—before 30. You don’t know your potential or what opportunities life may offer. It’s not about knowing <em>how</em> to do something, but rather doing it. Some people work tirelessly on accumulating experiences in their twenties, forgetting the need for “subtraction”—knowing when to let go. I believe around 30 is a crucial time—after building and exploring, you must learn to subtract. Otherwise, it’s too late. Why subtract? Not everything suits you, and not everything <em>should</em> suit you. You should try everything.</p>
<p>Eight lines bind you – how far can you run? They may restrain each other</p>

<p>By the time I was 30, I had been promoted exceptionally – in academia, that would be a professor; in journalism, a senior reporter. I received this exceptional promotion at 29. Such things are rare now, but it&rsquo;s when I first felt a profound sense of confusion. When I worked on the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and received much applause, I suddenly felt something was amiss. I started asking myself: what do I really want to do? What needs to be discarded? That year, I made a very important subtraction – I stopped my program for a year, without appearing abroad. Someone advised me that in this industry, if you’re out of sight for just a month, it&rsquo;s manageable; six months and people will forget you. I replied that my face must be pretty cheap.</p>
<p>That year, we started developing new programs. After a period of challenges and triumphs, I took a full year off in 2001. Everything I&rsquo;m doing today stems from the lessons learned during that time – learning to simplify. I could have pursued many avenues: sports, entertainment (E), producing, etc. But I realized I could only do news, and it was where I should be. I resigned from being the producer of three programs overnight, which led me to who I am today. It brought a sense of clarity. Just recently, talking with colleagues, I mentioned that a crucial decision I made in my late 20s wasn&rsquo;t about having many options; it was about focusing on news – this deep well. There were opportunities for promotion, even to deputy director, but I declined and returned to being an ordinary person.</p>
<p>Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.</p>
<p>Up until now, I&rsquo;ve been a senior-level cadre at CCTV, and even then, not everyone was an absolute bachelor&rsquo;s degree graduate. You understand our system, but I rejected it. I wanted to see how far a bachelor’s degree could go—why can’t a bachelor’s degree continuously learn and lead graduate students? Yes, now I supervise graduate students, 11 every year – all a result of backtracking. It&rsquo;s certainly a reflection on the past. Also, when young, it’s especially easy to feel entitled while constantly striving; any shortcoming or anything missed leaves me deeply uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Learn to subtract as well. When you&rsquo;re approaching 30, around 28 years old, watching the Olympics in 1996, I came up with a saying… In Zeng Guofan’s lengthy novel, there&rsquo;s an important sentence: what is the best state of life? Zeng Guofan wanted to name his study &ldquo;Hall of Seeking Deficiency.&rdquo; The best time is when flowers aren&rsquo;t fully open, when the moon isn&rsquo;t yet full. But for ordinary people, they see this as a flaw, not perfect enough, not reaching its peak. The best way to ruin someone is to make them pursue perfection and ultimate achievement.</p>
<p>Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.</p>
<p>The world isn&rsquo;t like that. A flower is at its best when it’s not fully bloomed; once it reaches full bloom, falling petals are near. Similarly, a full moon quickly fades to crescent. That&rsquo;s the important push and revelation for my 30th birthday. It&rsquo;s not about looking good at 40, but I feel more relaxed and free. Why question happiness instead of adhering to suits and black-and-white appearances?</p>
<h2 id="forty-years-old">Forty years old
</h2><p>Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Chinese saying, &ldquo;forty is the age of confusion.&rdquo; It’s said that thirty is about subtraction, and forty is supposed to be a time of clarity. But I think in this era, most people are confused at forty. My midlife crisis came early—I started questioning the value of everything I&rsquo;ve done around thirty-six or seven.</p>
<p>Does it even matter? Have I figured out what happiness is? This book was born from that confusion. You&rsquo;ll find, when you turn 30, that many of your goals for happiness are tied to material possessions; the &ldquo;establishing oneself by 30&rdquo; refers to having education and a stable foundation. You need a car and a house, otherwise your future mother-in-law won’t agree to her daughter marrying you – it&rsquo;s very materialistic. But being wise at 40 is difficult. I think ancient people probably had shorter average life expectancies, so they condensed it into 40 and declared wisdom; I&rsquo;m still confused at 40, <strong>物质没有给我带来，我以为会带给我的幸福</strong>. And that’s why so many people ask me when they turn 40, are you happy?</p>
<p>Is my book titled &ldquo;Waves of Happiness?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a question mark, representing the confusion in my heart. The birth of a midlife crisis—around 40, you need to answer many questions for yourself. Around 40, talk to yourself more and read widely to find your own answers. I’m grateful that I entered the world of the Tao Te Ching in my late thirties. As I mentioned in &ldquo;White Talk,&rdquo; when you reach 40 and still need to think things through, if the surrounding environment doesn&rsquo;t change—especially the soft environment—you leave home with a pleasant mood, only to encounter chaotic traffic lights everywhere, and everything you buy is fake, even your vaccinations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying that China has been battling two typhoons these past few days – one invisible, and one visible. The invisible typhoon is the vaccine, which impacts our sense of security. The other typhoon, rarely hitting mainland China from Shanghai, is beside the point. What you need to consider is this: you’ve improved yourself, gained many answers, but if the surrounding environment doesn&rsquo;t change, will you be happy? <strong>我有八个字说得比较重，我觉得我们现在是道德赤字人性亏损，这才是目前最大的赤字和最大的亏损</strong> Just recently, not far from here, I witnessed two cars collide; it wasn&rsquo;t a serious collision. The responsible driver pulled over after hitting another car and explained they would move to the side of the road. But the vehicle in front sped off, and no one stopped him.</p>
<p>Will he be a responsible father? A responsible son? Let alone a responsible citizen—and potentially your colleague. This is a moral deficit and a loss of humanity, which will inevitably affect you. No matter how important you are, unless you stay completely isolated at home, the problem is that even staying home won&rsquo;t prevent your children from needing vaccinations; if you deliver food, the food itself might be problematic!</p>
<p>So, how can a Chinese person learn to transform from an ordinary citizen into a responsible member of society – this is a crucial question for me personally and for our society as a whole, one I&rsquo;ve been grappling with around the age of 40</p>
<p>If 30 is about subtraction, and 40 is confusion, I think the word I&rsquo;d give myself for 50 is curiosity. 50 is awkward – neither here nor there, with options to advance or retreat. You can either build on what you’ve achieved or simply drift towards retirement.</p>
<p>Recently, I read a book that had an interesting passage: it stated that truly successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are often in their fifties and sixties—a concept quite different from our own. Just as we shouldn&rsquo;t equate volunteering solely with youth, so too should China move beyond the idea that entrepreneurship is exclusively for young people. Last week, I produced a program about recruiting retired elementary and middle school teachers, who would receive an annual subsidy of two or three million yuan to teach in rural areas—and they must be excellent teachers. This marks a pioneering effort in post-retirement employment, more than just charity. However, reaching 50 still feels distant. How can we move forward?</p>
<h2 id="fifty-years-old">Fifty years old
</h2><p>Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.</p>
<p>More importantly, for people around 50, there are two challenges. The first is yourself: Are you still curious about many things? What is your worldview? I think my greatest gain at 50, or how I am living right now,&hellip;</p>
<p>I think the best thing to watch today is Tsai Chin&rsquo;s concert DVD. She said something really good: &ldquo;Every time I look at photos, I think my younger self was so beautiful,&rdquo; but back then, twenty years ago, I never thought I looked good. That sentence has a certain flavor. I didn’t feel that way when I was 30; I thought I was quite handsome then, and focused on my flaws. But looking back after 20 years…</p>
<p>I was once young too, with so much hair. Treat your today well; seeing you again in two years will be wonderful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as Sishi Tong said, when my legs first lost their ability to walk and I was confined to a wheelchair, I spent every day longing for the days when I could run and play basketball. Every day in that remembrance was incredibly painful.
Years later, I developed pressure sores while in my wheelchair, and was incredibly uncomfortable. I constantly longed for the times from a few years prior when I felt no pain and could sit quietly in my chair.
Years later, I developed kidney failure and now require dialysis. At this point, I miss the time when I only had bedsores, even then. If I don&rsquo;t live to be 100, those first 50 years were for nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that you need to wait until 50 to understand this – people should realize it in their 30s or 40s. Everything can be easily missed. A meal during a trip, if you don’t eat it, even 30 years later, it won&rsquo;t have the same taste. So my first feeling at 50 is to cherish every day.</p>
<p>The second thing is curiosity. I realize that I can stop being curious about many things at any time, because I&rsquo;ve seen and experienced so much. However, I push myself to be curious. So now, when doing a lot of things, I approach them with a sense of curiosity – can the phone be held vertically for filming? Yes, it can. Can you do live reporting? Can you make seemingly grand summits more relaxed, more fun, and leave a lasting impression? Can you use new media to spread it? All possible. I think curiosity is the most important driving force for human progress. Why can&rsquo;t it be the most important driving force for an individual’s progress? A nation declines when it loses its curiosity. On a larger scale, 50 is a significant test. What kind of vested interest do you become in China at forty or fifty years old? I am very worried that many people around us, hoping to achieve their dreams when they were young, once they realize those dreams and become established figures, turn into people who obstruct others from achieving theirs. Am I right? They then treat young people and things using the very methods they used to dislike.</p>
<p>So, a few years ago, I started recruiting 11 graduate students each year as a volunteer, mentoring them for two years. We&rsquo;ve now had five graduating classes, totaling 55 students. It feels wonderful to be in this position of influence – you gain insights and the ability to guide them. After each day of teaching, we’d have dinner together, which doesn’t cost much. But that&rsquo;s what a good mentor should do. Being a mentor can take two forms: one is like being a stepping stone. I once said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to say thank you too much to those who helped me,&rdquo; because my way of saying thank you is to treat the new generation with even greater care and dedication.</p>
<p>First, it&rsquo;s about paving the way for others. I hope that those who have benefited materially, economically, ideologically, and culturally – all sectors – when you achieve success, consider how you should act. Those who derailed the train yesterday become those blocking it today; history of China is full of such examples, and this will continue if things don&rsquo;t change, perhaps even more so. Therefore, I urge all established beneficiaries to return to the mindset they had when they were young – what kind of people did they want to encounter? Perhaps I haven’t done enough, but at least I am thinking, doing, and speaking about it.</p>
