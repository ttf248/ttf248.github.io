<h2 id="transcript-1">Transcript
</h2><p>I believe the best journalist first has a social conscience, second has knowledge reserves, and third can run long distances – I’ve stopped being intimidated by 100 meters; I&rsquo;ve been running. I think these three things combined explain why I feel suited to journalism at my age of 50. I’m naturally intertwined with China’s reform for the past 40 years. When I turned 30, standing on the banks of the Songhua River, and when I turned 40, my birthday coincided with the 2008 Olympics – I went in during the live broadcast and came out during the broadcast. Now at 50, as the nation commemorates 40 years of reform and opening up, it’s certainly a corresponding moment: if the “Great Era” is at 40, what about China&rsquo;s reform at 40 – is it a period of confusion or enlightenment? “Looking at China after 40 years of development, it has already given people and the country a tremendous amount in terms of material wealth. However, anxiety and confusion have increased rather than decreased. We thought that becoming strong and wealthy meant everything was okay, but we realized that material prosperity is just a foundation. It’s easy to escape poverty materially, but truly becoming prosperous spiritually and emerging as a major power is incredibly difficult. The United States is now targeting our high-tech industries – we need to target agricultural products. There&rsquo;s always this saying in the world: it&rsquo;s hard for number two to become number one! How many ‘second’ iPhones did America fix? Therefore, we must undergo a long period of time transforming ‘number two’ into something that surpasses ourselves. I can’t get everything; I need to focus on what I can truly achieve.”</p>
<h2 id="transcript-2">Transcript
</h2><p>I was fortunate to start working in television at 25, beginning with person interviews. I came into contact with hundreds or even thousands of figures who carried various halos and reputations. Back then, as a young man, I thought these halos must have made them incredibly happy. But when I got closer, I realized no, the halos had little to do with their happiness, and sometimes they were even inversely proportional. Recently, I finished watching Guo Mo’er&rsquo;s last 29 years. Guo Mo’er barely escaped persecution throughout his life, holding positions like Deputy Vice Premier, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC, and Honorary Vice Chairman. But did he find happiness? Did he have a happy life considering his two sons committed suicide and another was possibly pushed to death from a building?</p>
<p>What do you use to measure happiness? When you’re in your sixties or seventies, if you lose two sons in a few years, can that make you happy? “Having many famous calligraphy and paintings can bring happiness, allowing oneself to spend many years safely – what do you need? I think reading people is the best mirror. To put it briefly, I feel that much of our current anxiety comes from thinking too much and not reading enough books. This is Yang Geng Lan’s reply to a young man: if you don&rsquo;t read books, you rely on fast food; just pick up a phone and try to find a quick fix. How can that be possible? I learned how to be clever through the slow, cumbersome process of reading a book; subtraction comes from reducing the number of books one reads – the more one reads, the less one needs.”</p>
<h2 id="transcript-3">Transcript
</h2><p>Therefore, I don’t expect everyone to be able to read the best version of themselves through reading, but I hope the proportion increases – that more and more Chinese people can develop themselves better through reading. No one sits on the ground and looks up at the sky, trying to figure out everything; I cannot do that. But I can look in a mirror. A few years ago, a BBC news anchor came to Beijing, claiming to be the BBC’s most outstanding news anchor, and a well-meaning person organized a dialogue between him and a Chinese news anchor at the International Hotel. During our conversation, he asked me a question: “Do you think the BBC should learn from CCTV?” I first made a joke and said, &ldquo;Of course, they should first learn Chinese.&rdquo; Then, after making the joke, I said, &ldquo;The BBC should most of all learn the world’s curiosity. We&rsquo;ve rapidly gone to the world in recent years…&rdquo; Here’s the English translation of the provided text:</p>
<p>“We have various bureaus, currently exceeding 70. We feel that whenever a student sees something new from abroad, they are incredibly curious. We observe the world with this immense curiosity, and BBC has already considered Britain itself to be global – you&rsquo;ve lost that sense of wonder. Older brother is right, what we lack is precisely this. In 2007, when I interviewed a Japanese writer for him, he said about Japan, ‘Besides lacking hope, it has everything else.’ Later, I realized the depth of his words. From another angle, ten years ago, I felt that China lacked everything except hope – everyone believed there was a future ahead.”</p>
<h2 id="transcript-4">Transcript
</h2><p>But won’t one day we also become a wealthy nation that only desires everything? To be honest, I&rsquo;m very worried that China will end up being a negative one – when you have everything, you realize how truly poor you are. When I’m 50 years old, I fear becoming someone who can satisfy all material conditions but is incredibly impoverished. In our reality, there are many highly educated people with no culture, and there are many poor people with countless numbers on their bank accounts – this is the problem of this era. True poverty isn&rsquo;t frightening because there’s a forward direction and hope. This is why I say that a lack of morality and human flaws are the root causes. That’s why I think scientists invented so much not because they initially carried great missions, but out of curiosity.</p>
<p>Can I figure out how to make it? “So I’ve always started to urge myself to be more curious around the age of 50, so I’m very happy. The one thing that’s currently bothering me is persistence. When you were just talking about ‘you’re still persisting,’ I said, ‘Don’t say that – once you persist, you’re close to death.’ We used to say that persistence equals success, and if Chinese football just persisted through the ‘black three minutes’ – if they just kept at it – it was all about perseverance. But without method or fun, it became a matter of simply persisting. Sometimes persistence is important, but often this saying has two sides. I&rsquo;m afraid that when I do something, like talking to people, I’ll persist and finish what I started, even though my time is now up. But I’m curious, and I want to see how my conversations with others will turn out.”</p>
<h2 id="transcript-5">Transcript
</h2><p>Give yourself a very small keyword, but engage in conversations with people. I think that at 50 years old, as long as you can maintain a great deal of curiosity, there’s no problem, I like all fun things, but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be the most popular thing today. Today’s trends might disappear overnight. There are always trending words every year; do you remember some of them? Could some media on the internet 10 years from now become traditional media? So, fun things will always have their own inherent appeal, and I respect everyone&rsquo;s likes – there must be a reason for it. But when you look at it in the long run, you’ll find that Chinese people still like to play mahjong the most. When you also like eating fast food, then restaurants serving large meals will naturally start to close down.</p>
<p>Many things are not just about expressing feelings and moving on. How much fragmented reading do you get from your daily mobile phone use? How much longer-form reading do you have? But this is also a process, and the phone is becoming our handcuffs. So I feel that people are increasingly consuming shorter things, which leads to people gradually becoming short-sighted, but this is also a process – I never worry about content being king. It will always return. You’ll keep entertaining yourself to death every day, until you&rsquo;re 40 years old, just like when I see teenagers drinking soda, and I try to tell them to drink less, but you know they will inevitably drink it. However, on the other hand, I’m optimistic – he will eventually return to the world of tea. This is a typical Chinese life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly normal, but I hope this transition happens faster. We’re just expressing an observation: investigative journalism has become so rare these days, and people don’t read it.</p>
<p>Thank you all.</p>
