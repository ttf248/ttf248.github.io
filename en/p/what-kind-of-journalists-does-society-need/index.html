<p>The best journalists first possess a social conscience, then knowledge, and finally perseverance. It’s not enough to just run a short distance; it requires endurance. Combining these three qualities, people expect that potential safety concerns regarding vaccines will be completely resolved – like the milk powder incident, where progress is consistently made through cycles of problem emergence and resolution, ultimately leading to complete solutions. Otherwise, what&rsquo;s the point of journalists?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe the best journalists first possess a sense of social responsibility, second, a foundation of knowledge, and third, perseverance – it’s not enough to just run 100 meters; you have to keep running. Combining these three qualities, I turned 50 this year, and you&rsquo;ll understand that I seem well-suited for journalism. I am naturally closely linked to China’s 40 years of reform. When I turned 30, I stood on the bank of the Songhua River; when I turned 40, my birthday was spent entering and exiting the Olympic broadcasts in 2008. Turning 50 this year coincides with nationwide commemorations of the 40th anniversary of China’s reform and opening-up. So, if we consider a person&rsquo;s 40th year and China’s 40 years of reform – are they a time of clarity or confusion?</p>
<p>After 40 years, China has provided ample material wealth for both its people and the nation. Yet, anxiety and confusion have increased instead of diminished. We thought that strength and prosperity would solve everything, but we&rsquo;ve discovered that material comfort is just a foundation – escaping poverty materially is easy, but achieving spiritual richness and becoming a true global power is incredibly difficult. The U.S. is already targeting our high-tech sector; we need to focus on agricultural products. There’s always a difficulty in being the “number two.” How many number twos has America replaced? Therefore, we inevitably face a long journey to transform this &ldquo;second&rdquo; status into something beyond ourselves – I can&rsquo;t expect to have it all.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to start in television at 25, initially doing interviews. I came into contact with hundreds or even thousands of people surrounded by various auras. When young, we thought these auras must bring happiness, but upon getting closer, it turned out not to be the case; the aura and their happiness often had an inverse relationship. Just finished reading about Guo Moruo’s last 29 years—despite holding high positions like Vice Premier of the State Council and various leadership roles in political advisory bodies, both his sons died, one by suicide and another possibly thrown from a building. Could he have been happy?</p>
<p>What do you use to measure happiness? For a former vice premier, having two sons leave her within a few years in their sixties and seventies could bring her happiness. Many famous calligraphy works can bring happiness. Having safely lived through many years can bring happiness. What more is needed? So I think observing people&rsquo;s reading habits is the best mirror. To put it slightly emphatically, I feel that many people’s anxiety now stems from thinking too much and reading too little. This is a reply from Mrs. Yang Jiang to a young person. People expect instant gratification without reading, hoping to find a quick fix with just a phone. How could that be possible? I learned to be clever through the clumsy process of reading books; subtraction comes from reading more and more.</p>
<p>Therefore, I don&rsquo;t expect everyone to change, but I hope the proportion increases – that more and more Chinese people can find a better version of themselves through education. That’s what matters most. No one sits on the ground staring at the stars and figures everything out; I can’t do that. But I can look in the mirror. A few years ago, a BBC news anchor—they claimed he was their best—came to Beijing. Someone organized a dialogue between him and Chinese anchors at the International Hotel, and we had a conversation. During the discussion, he asked me what the BBC should learn from CCTV. I joked, “Of course, first you need to learn Chinese.”</p>
<p>Next, I joked that the BBC should learn from CCTV about its curiosity towards the world. We&rsquo;ve rapidly expanded our presence globally in recent years, establishing over 70 foreign bureaus. Our reporters feel a great sense of curiosity when encountering new things abroad, observing the world with immense eagerness. The BBC, however, seems to have settled for Britain as their entire world—they’ve lost that curiosity. My friend slapped the table and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right; that&rsquo;s exactly what we lack.&rdquo; In 2007, a Japanese writer told me something similar during an interview: “This country has everything except hope.” I understood then how profound those words were. Looking at it from another angle, a decade ago, I felt China lacked almost everything except for hope—everyone believed there was potential ahead.</p>
<p>But I worry about a day when we too become a wealthy nation with everything but hope. To be honest, I fear that China will reach a point where it feels truly poor despite having everything. I dread becoming someone who has all their material needs met but is ultimately very impoverished at 50. We see many highly educated yet uncultured people and countless individuals with overflowing bank accounts who are still poor in spirit. This is the problem of our time. True poverty isn&rsquo;t frightening; it holds potential and hope for the future. That’s why I believe there&rsquo;s a moral deficit and a loss of humanity – scientists invent things not out of some grand mission, but from curiosity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see what I can produce. So, starting around 50, I began pushing myself to be even more curious, which makes me happy. One frustrating thing now is persistence. You mentioned you’re still persistent, and I said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; because once persistence becomes a matter of life or death, it&rsquo;s close to the end. We used to say that perseverance equals victory. In Chinese football, we&rsquo;d grit our teeth and persevere through those black three minutes – no fun, no method, just perseverance. Perseverance can be important sometimes, but often this statement has two sides. I worry that when I’m persevering in something, like finishing this conversation even though my time is up, I wonder what it will turn out like.</p>
<p>Give yourself a small focus, but engage in conversation with everyone. I believe that as long as you can maintain a strong sense of curiosity at 50, it’s fine. I like all fun things, though not necessarily the current trends—today&rsquo;s fashions can disappear quickly. Do you remember any past buzzwords? Can today&rsquo;s internet media possibly evolve into what traditional media once was? Fun always has an inherent appeal. I respect everyone&rsquo;s preferences; there&rsquo;s a reason behind them. But in the long run, people still prefer playing mahjong. When you enjoy fast food, the restaurants serving elaborate meals will naturally decline.</p>
<p>Many things can&rsquo;t just be dismissed with a passing thought. How much fragmented reading do you do on your phone each day? How much longer-form content do you actually read? But this is also a process; the phone is becoming our shackle. I don’t worry about “content is king,” because seeing more and more short-form content will gradually lead to nearsightedness, but it&rsquo;s a process nonetheless. People will indulge in entertainment until they reach 40, just like seeing teenagers drinking soda – you advise them to drink less, but you know they won’t listen. However, I remain optimistic; at 40, he will return to the world of tea. That is the essence of a Chinese life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s normal, but I hope the next change comes quicker. We’re just lamenting how few investigative journalists there are now; you don’t seem to be doing investigations anymore.</p>
<p>Thank you all</p>
