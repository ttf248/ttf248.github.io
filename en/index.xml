        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, my biological clock has been a bit off, still messing around with GitHub Pages deployments at nearly 2 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to eat after work, and I just wanted to sleep as soon as I finished eating. After eating, I came back around 8:30 PM, feeling drowsy, I thought about taking a nap, and then fell asleep immediately. When I woke up, it was already nearly 2 AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;facepalm&#34;&gt;Facepalm
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we said there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be much frontend development, but today it’s not frontend – it’s the experience of UI/UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project&#34;&gt;Project
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please join our old friend, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&lt;/a&gt;.
That’s the original self-selected stock project – we&amp;rsquo;re restructuring the overall project structure, and all subsequent AI programming content will be housed within this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploying-multiple-pages&#34;&gt;Deploying Multiple Pages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project is hosted domestically at [https://cnb.cool/ttf248/ai-coding-demo]. Due to well-known reasons, pages cannot be published within China, so we need to publish them on GitHub outside of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog is published on this external GitHub. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried it before, and also, the current project I’m working on isn’t a traditional blog site; it simply contains a lot of documentation layered with several static HTML design mockups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/github-pages-easter-egg-deploy-multiple-sites/20250528030230.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right – this page is where I first discovered that deploying multiple pages using Pages doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect the blog’s publication, but instead adds a new path under the blog’s domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[https://ttf248.life/ai-coding-demo/](https://ttf248.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-study-group&#34;&gt;AI Study Group
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I created a new category and thought about using AI to learn many computer courses, such as algorithms and LeetCode practice problems.
Each learning record is published on the blog to form a knowledge base. A new category was created: AI Study Group.
Now it seems that different courses require creating separate projects, and all learning notes are written in the project&amp;rsquo;s Readme.md file.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Old problems, the flamboyant beauty of blossoming flowers (a reference to a famous Chinese poem).</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/old-ailment-stunning-flowers/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;For many years, I’ve focused on backend development, and recently started to explore &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; programming while dipping my toes into some frontend-related content. However, during this period of tinkering, I gradually realized I was falling back into an old habit – being dazzled by shiny new things. I constantly try to use &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; to create a frontend interface, but in reality, these attempts haven’t provided much practical benefit for my current work and are actually diverting my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-use-cases&#34;&gt;AI Use Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In small projects, AI tools can truly shine, particularly when writing independent functions with low coupling to the system and simple business logic. These tasks typically have clear inputs and outputs, and rely less on context – making them well-suited for the current capabilities of AI-assisted programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when facing complex system architectures or deep business logic, the limitations of AI become increasingly apparent. It may generate code that appears reasonable but is actually detached from the project’s real needs, or even introduce potential issues that are difficult to debug. In these scenarios, AI is best suited as an assistive tool rather than a fully autonomous code generator. We need to conduct rigorous review and testing of any generated code to ensure it meets actual requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;errors-and-the-cost-of-learning&#34;&gt;Errors and the Cost of Learning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While attempting to generate frontend code using AI, I encountered numerous challenges. As frontend development isn&amp;rsquo;t my area of expertise, troubleshooting often proved time-consuming and frustrating. Even after adjusting prompts to have the AI rewrite the code, it was difficult to avoid the appearance of some low-level errors. This iterative process not only wasted time but also highlighted that my current focus should be on backend business logic rather than exploring unfamiliar domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the project completed over the weekend, I’m more confident that focusing on backend development and user interaction logic, implementing functionality through a console, is the most efficient approach currently. Perhaps systematically learning frontend knowledge would be a better strategy when I have more time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;frontend-learning-plan&#34;&gt;Frontend Learning Plan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frontend technology stack is complex and diverse, so it’s unrealistic to quickly master it. I plan to first choose a framework, such as Vue.js or React.js, and deeply learn its core concepts and usage methods. Only after becoming familiar with the fundamentals will I attempt to use AI to generate frontend code, which can effectively avoid errors and wasted time caused by unfamiliarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the focus for this stage should be on backend development, steadily building up my core skills. Once the timing is right, I’ll explore the combination of frontend and AI – potentially yielding greater rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Claude4 released, attempting to develop: Hugo tags, hyperlink translation assistant</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/claude-4-release-and-experimentation-hugo-tags-hyperlink-translation-assistant/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 03:05:31 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/claude-4-release-and-experimentation-hugo-tags-hyperlink-translation-assistant/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This site is developed using Hugo, but I’ve always used Chinese titles, which results in less friendly generated article links. In simpler terms, when shared, they don&amp;rsquo;t look as good because the Chinese characters are escaped into formats like %E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD within the links. While you can solve this by setting a slug, it’s tedious to do manually every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I decided to try using Claude4 to develop a translation assistant that automatically converts Chinese titles to English slugs and adds hyperlinks within the articles. This would eliminate the need for manual setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude4 is amazing – its contextual understanding has significantly improved, as has its efficiency in handling complex tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-address&#34;&gt;Project Address
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestic Project Address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cnb.cool/ttf248/hugo-content-suite&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;https://github.com/ttf248/hugo-content-suite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-implementation&#34;&gt;Code Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s first discuss the implementation approach: We need to scan all articles, extract tag information and article titles, and then call the local large model (such as gemma-3-12b-it) for translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In actual development, Claude4 showcased several significant advantages compared to previous generation large models. Due to the diverse functional requirements, Claude4 automatically designed an interactive menu, comprehensively considering various usage scenarios. For example, in tag processing, Claude4 not only supports tag statistics and analysis but also includes classification statistics, and can even detect &lt;strong&gt;unlabeled articles&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, it provides &lt;strong&gt;preview&lt;/strong&gt; and tag page generation functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s integrating with the local large model, adding translation caches, or performing large-scale code refactoring, Claude4 completes everything in one go, with almost no issues. Despite the project’s small scale, it incorporates many minor features. In previous development cycles with large models, there was often a tendency to forget earlier content; however, Claude 4 performed exceptionally well, &lt;strong&gt;virtually eliminating context loss&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, its intelligence has increased, and we plan to switch to Claude 4 for more development work as our primary coding model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;translation-cache&#34;&gt;Translation Cache
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach, besides reducing the number of calls to large models, is quite efficient when running a 12b model locally – it doesn’t waste much time. However, if you need to call the large model every time, it will still be somewhat slow. Secondly, to fix the connections within articles, if a full update operation is executed and the article title is very long, there&amp;rsquo;s occasionally a situation where the two translated results differ, causing the link to change – which is quite awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;feature-optimization&#34;&gt;Feature Optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire project was handed over to &lt;code&gt;Claude4&lt;/code&gt; to analyze the space for optimization and generate the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewed the code, which had no issues whatsoever. For example, the configuration files were reviewed, and the original code’s configurations were converted into default configurations. When reading the configuration file, if a corresponding configuration file did not exist, a default configuration file would be automatically generated to avoid user operational errors. Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation of the provided text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Requirements: When translating, dynamically calculate the current translation efficiency, estimate remaining time, and output relevant information to the console. Currently, we’re obtaining the character count of the article, the number of characters translated per line, the time taken, and fitting a calculation for the translation time of every 100 characters. Simultaneously, we&amp;rsquo;re calculating the estimated remaining translation time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is complete, but the effect isn’t satisfactory, so I ask AI to provide a new design solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide multiple efficiency calculation methods: real-time efficiency, average efficiency, and sliding window efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve display format: progress bar, segmented statistics, dynamic refresh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more useful metrics: API call counts, success rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing the code, we discovered a new surprise – translation efficiency statistics were flooding the console in real time, but without endless scrolling.” Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation of the provided text:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Multi-dimensional impacts of the family planning policy: deep transformations from social structure to economic and political changes.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/planned-parenthood-multidimensional-impact-social-structure-economic-political-transformation/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;China’s population control policies, while limiting growth and curbing family-style development, have disrupted traditional social structures, suppressed the expansion of family-owned businesses and political dynasty power, presenting a unique case compared to Korean conglomerates and Indian family monopolies. Now that birth restrictions are being relaxed, despite facing challenges such as low fertility rates, it’s crucial to be wary of new monopoly risks and seek balance through multiple avenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;one-the-tension-between-population-control-and-family-style-development&#34;&gt;One: The Tension Between Population Control and Family-Style Development
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family planning policy, implemented in China for nearly forty years as a basic national strategy, has achieved significant direct results. Data shows that from 1978 to 2007, China’s natural population growth rate declined from 12‰ to 5.2‰, resulting in a reduction of over 40 million people, and the country&amp;rsquo;s share of the world’s population decreased from 22.2% to 20.1%. This sharp deceleration in population growth profoundly reshaped China’s social family structure. Taking family-owned enterprises as an example, after the implementation of the family planning policy, the number of children born by business owners significantly declined: before the policy, the proportion of those having three or more children reached 40.63%, and after the policy it plummeted to 18.46%, the proportion of single sons born increased from 6.25% to 32.31%. This structural change directly reduced the range of potential internal successors for family-owned enterprises, objectively suppressing their generational expansion capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;one-the-tension-between-population-control-and-familial-development&#34;&gt;One: The Tension Between Population Control and Familial Development
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing Korea and India reveals significant differences. While Korea did not implement strict birth control measures, fertility rates have remained low for a long time (0.7 in 2023), the chaebols still firmly control the nation’s economic lifeline through cross-shareholdings and tax avoidance strategies like inheritance taxes. The top five chaebols account for over 50% of Korea&amp;rsquo;s GDP, with Samsung Group alone contributing 20%. India presents a contrasting picture: 79% of its economic output is generated by family-owned businesses, with six major conglomerates controlling key sectors such as telecommunications and steel, and the top 20 enterprises earning 80% of national corporate profits. The core difference lies in the fact that China’s population control policies limited family sizes, thereby weakening the human resources base for chaebol expansion at its source.  Due to different policy environments, familial power has continued to penetrate economic sectors in Korea and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-monopoly-restraint-and-social-structural-transformation&#34;&gt;II. Monopoly Restraint and Social Structural Transformation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the economic sector is particularly evident in its suppression of monopolistic phenomena. Due to declining birth rates, Chinese family businesses have struggled to form conglomerates akin to those in South Korea and Japan. Taking South Korea as an example, chaebols maintained their control through “circular capital” investments, with the Samsung family holding only 2% of the group’s shares while wielding overall control through complex equity structures. Conversely, in China, post-family planning, family businesses generally faced difficulties in “passing down the business” to heirs, necessitating the introduction of professional managers or implementing equity diversification reforms. According to a湃新闻 (Papare News) study, the proportion of female successors in family businesses after family planning has increased from 13.85% to 34.21%, and the education level of these successors has significantly improved, with the percentage of undergraduates rising from 43.75% to 98.46%. This transition, while not completely eliminating family control, significantly reduced the possibility of a single family monopolizing the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the social structure level, the population planning policy accelerated the breakdown of traditional family core patterns. China’s average household size decreased from 4.41 people/household in 1982 to 2.62 people/household in 2020, with smaller families weakening the family&amp;rsquo;s functions in areas such as economics, education, and social support. In contrast, India maintains an average family size of around 4 people, with the caste system deeply intertwined with family power, leading to low social mobility. China’s transformation of its family structure created space for individualism; in 2023, China had 240 million single adult citizens, and a trend of “one-person economy” emerged in the consumer market, further diminishing the influence of family economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;three-decentralization-of-power-in-the-political-sphere&#34;&gt;Three. Decentralization of Power in the Political Sphere
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the political ecology has been profound. Traditionally, family power structures had infiltrated grassroots politics through bloodlines and kinship relationships. For example, in Henan’s Xinye County, 161 political families almost controlled all government departments, with 20% of cadres at deputy-officer level or above belonging to “officer’s children.” However, after the implementation of the family planning policy, the shrinking family size limited the expansion of family networks. Research from Peking University showed that after family planning, the number of offspring of officials decreased, and the complexity of family political networks significantly declined. Furthermore, the policy-driven promotion of education (the average years of schooling increased from 5.2 in 1982 to 10.9 in 2023) facilitated social mobility, weakening the monopoly of family power over political resources. Comparing Korea and India, the deep entanglement between Korean conglomerates (like Samsung Group executives and government corruption) and India’s caste-based hereditary political lineage highlights the uniqueness of Chinese policy. China, through its population control policies, objectively reduced the possibility of power succession. While familial phenomena still exist within county-level politics, the overall trend is towards a decentralization of power structures. During the 2025 National People&amp;rsquo;s Congress (NPC) session, an NPC delegate proposed renaming “The Population and Family Planning Law” to “The Population and Reproduction Law,” fully opening up birth limits – a move that could further influence the evolution of future political ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;four-challenges-and-opportunities-following-policy-adjustments&#34;&gt;Four. Challenges and Opportunities Following Policy Adjustments
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the 2016 nationwide two-child policy and the 2021 three-child policy marked a significant shift in China’s birth policies. However, the policy effects were limited: births in 2022 totaled only 1.18, far below the replacement level (2.1). The relaxation of birth restrictions had a dual impact on family-owned businesses: on one hand, some entrepreneurs may strengthen family succession capabilities through multiple births, such as Zong Qinghou’s daughter, Zong Fufeng, who took over as the sole heir to Wahaha Group; on the other hand, high childcare costs (the average cost of raising a child to 18 years old in first-tier cities reaching 1 million yuan) and declining fertility intentions among professional women limited family size expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the economic sphere, relaxing birth restrictions may give rise to new monopoly forms. The three-child policy has driven consolidation in the maternal and childcare industries, with the estimated market size for infant care expected to reach 1621 by 2025. - 300 million yuan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading enterprises are utilizing mergers and acquisitions to integrate smaller manufacturers, resulting in a CR5 market concentration exceeding 55%. This increase in concentration may bring about efficiency gains, but it also warrants vigilance against new monopoly risks. The government needs to strike a balance between encouraging childbirth and preventing market consolidation, such as strengthening regulation through antitrust laws while providing childcare subsidies (e.g., Hangzhou’s three-child families receiving RMB 3,000 per month in milk powder subsidies) to alleviate household burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the political sphere, relaxing birth restrictions could have subtle impacts on family power structures. While it is unlikely to restore traditional family political networks in the short term, over the long term, larger families may form new influence within grassroots politics. Therefore, refining personnel selection mechanisms and strengthening oversight (such as establishing a nepotism avoidance system for officials) remains crucial in preventing hereditary power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;five-international-mirroring-and-future-outlook&#34;&gt;Five. International Mirroring and Future Outlook
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiences of South Korea and India demonstrate a close correlation between the ebb and flow of family power structures and policy orientations. South Korea achieved economic takeoff by supporting conglomerates, but at the cost of social inequality; India’s failure to implement effective policies to curb family monopolies has exacerbated wealth disparity. China’s population control policy effectively controlled population growth while also suppressing the expansion of family power, yet it resulted in issues such as an aging population and labor shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, China needs to find a new balance between population policy and socio-economic development. On one hand, implementing fertility support policies (such as extending maternity leave and building universal childcare institutions) should boost birth rates; on the other hand, strengthening antitrust enforcement is crucial to prevent family businesses from forming new monopolies through capital operations. In the political sphere, further progress must be made in grassroots democratic construction, with enhanced oversight mechanisms to ensure transparency in governance. Ultimately, the family planning policy served as a key driver of social transformation in China; its impact extended far beyond population issues. It reshaped family structures, economic models, and the political landscape, providing a path for China to avoid falling into the trap of family monopolies like those seen in Korea and India. With the policy’s adjustment, how to balance efficiency and equity, freedom and order within the new demographic context will be a long-term challenge facing China.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AI overuse can lead to some lingering effects.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-overuse-side-effects/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 19:39:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-overuse-side-effects/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since we’ve established “AI Inspiration Collision Forum,” there’s been a lot of noise – many things, both good and bad – being tried out using AI for recording and publishing, and less time spent on quiet self-reflection. It feels like this is becoming increasingly rare. Moving forward, it would be beneficial to slightly control the output of this section and consolidate it into a monthly magazine format, releasing one article per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is almost like a post-traumatic effect – or a side effect – where efficiency has increased, but the depth and breadth of thought have declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;efficiency-boost-undeniable&#34;&gt;Efficiency Boost: Undeniable
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Seven-Second Fish Sightseeing” column used to be poorly maintained, with only a few hot events covered. Due to laziness, I hadn’t searched the internet for relevant materials or compiled notes. Now that various AI tools are available, all it takes is outlining the key points, and AI can automatically search for related events, generate articles as needed, simply format them, and publish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like a blessing for lazy people – efficiency has increased significantly, almost to the point of doubling effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond writing articles, efficiency gains are real when coding. Previously, writing code often required detailed reading of API interface documentation. Now, I can skip this entirely. This is incredibly valuable because familiarizing oneself with APIs is “physical labor,” not “mental labor.” AI handles this part perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spam-content&#34;&gt;Spam Content
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many articles have poor quality content, not to say that there’s nothing there; it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t read well, lacking a sense of reality and what people actually experience. This is a style I previously disliked – like chewing wax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From another perspective, AI-generated content really does feel like products of a流水线 (liú shuǐ liàn - assembly line) production, lacking soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spam of the New Internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forgetting&#34;&gt;Forgetting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of document is entirely AI-generated, and the reader’s context is unclear. However, over time, my own impressions will become blurred, or even forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar issues occur when writing code – without reviewing commit records, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember how I originally thought about it, or why I wrote it that way. This is particularly evident with code generated through repeated communication with AI, where the final code differs significantly from the initial ideas, sometimes drastically so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;search&#34;&gt;Search
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the number of times I’ve opened Google and Baidu has noticeably decreased. Many questions are now being answered by AI for searching and interaction, and the results are much better than traditional search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s mourn the &lt;code&gt;bing ai&lt;/code&gt;, which may no longer be active, a pioneering AI tool from a major company that could connect to the internet and search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using Google less, and I’ve reduced my visits to &lt;code&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/code&gt; as well – many questions are now simply asked of AI, and this website is gradually being phased out by the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My maintained blog, originally with very little traffic, is now even less expected of; it’s primarily a place for self-reflection and recording.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trade war abruptly called a pause</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 19:07:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of trade war tariffs in 2025 presented a “escalation – counter-repressive measures – negotiations” cycle, with the US-China rivalry shifting from tariff confrontation to competition over rules. Despite short-term easing that alleviated market pressure, long-term uncertainty remains, and it’s crucial to monitor WTO rulings, supply chain adjustments, and geopolitical shifts&amp;rsquo; sustained impact on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don’t earn money beyond their own cognitive expectations; the stock market crash triggered by the launch of the trade war this year has largely been recovered, but countless small investors have been buried along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2025 Trade War Tariff Timeline Overview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a timeline of the trade war tariff events, combining key events involving the US and China, and other countries, to present the dynamic evolution of tariff policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-april-2025-comprehensive-upgrade-and-countermeasures-on-tariffs&#34;&gt;I. April 2025: Comprehensive Upgrade and Countermeasures on Tariffs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Tariff Measures Against China&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2nd:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration signed Executive Order No. 14257, announcing the imposition of a 34% “retaliatory tariff” on goods exported from China to the U.S., covering products originating in Hong Kong and Macao.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 8th:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States further increased the “retaliatory tariff” rate on Chinese goods from 34% to 84%, and signed Executive Orders No. 14259 and 14266, imposing tariffs on additional products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 10th:&lt;/strong&gt; The White House amended the executive order, increasing the total tariff amount against China to 145%, and raising the tariff rate on small packages (such as goods priced below $800 from 90% to 120%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s Countermeasures&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 4th:&lt;/strong&gt; China announced the imposition of a 34% tariff on all goods originating in the United States, covering sectors such as agricultural products, automobiles, and energy. - &lt;strong&gt;April 10th&lt;/strong&gt;: China will retaliate against the tariff rate increase from 34% to 84%, in sync with the US side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 12th&lt;/strong&gt;: China cancels the additional tariffs imposed on U.S. goods by 91% (corresponding to some of the cancellation by the US side) and suspends the implementation of 24% tariffs for 90 days, retaining 10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-april-2025-comprehensive-tariff-upgrade-and-countermeasures&#34;&gt;I. April 2025: Comprehensive Tariff Upgrade and Countermeasures
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariff Games Involving Other Countries&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US-Canada Trade War:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States imposes 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum products, and Canada retaliates by taxing goods worth $298 billion from the US, as well as filing a WTO dispute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EU &amp;amp; Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; The EU imposes maximum 25% tariffs on US goods, while Japan expresses concern over auto tariffs imposed by the US, calling the trade war “harming both sides.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-may-2025-geneva-talks-and-tariff-de-escalation&#34;&gt;II. May 2025: Geneva Talks and Tariff De-escalation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US-China High-Level Trade Talks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 10-11:&lt;/strong&gt; The US and China held a 16-hour meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, reaching the “Joint Statement on the US-China Economic Dialogue” (also known as the Geneva Accord).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 12:&lt;/strong&gt; Both sides announced a suspension of some tariffs:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United States paused its 24% tariff on Chinese goods (for 90 days), retaining 10%, and rescinded the additional tariffs imposed on April 8th and 9th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China simultaneously suspended its 24% retaliatory tariffs, retaining 10%, and lifted non-tariff measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishment of a Consultation Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Both sides agreed to hold regular trade consultations in China, the United States, or a third country, focusing on tariff reduction and rulemaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Impact &amp;amp; Policy Adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Domestic Pressure:&lt;/strong&gt; High tariffs led to the closure of small and medium-sized enterprises (such as Amazon sellers forced to close due to tariff surges) and rising inflation expectations (core PCE is expected to rise to 3…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-other-key-events-and-long-term-impacts&#34;&gt;III. Other Key Events and Long-Term Impacts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WTO and Multilateral Responses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canada and China both lodged WTO disputes against the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and “retaliatory tariffs,” alleging violations of non-discrimination principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTO Director-General Azevedo warned that U.S. tariffs could cause a 1% contraction in global trade volumes by 2025, exacerbating difficulties for developing countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exemption Lists and Industry Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Excluded Goods:&lt;/strong&gt; A 37-page list covering strategic materials such as rare earths, graphite, and medical CT balls exposed supply chain vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto Tariffs:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imported automobiles, leading to an estimated 2% decline in global auto production and a 9% reduction in North American output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political and Strategic Maneuvering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration attempted to reshape the international trade order through “retaliatory tariffs,” but was criticized as unilateral bullying, triggering backlash from allies (such as the EU and Japan).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The United States imposes additional tariffs of 34% on goods from Hong Kong and Macau.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;April 8th&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The United States raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 84% and added new executive orders.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;April 10th&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;China retaliates by imposing a 34% tariff, later raised to 84%; the US adjusts tariffs to 145%.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;April 12th&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The United States waived some goods (such as technology products), China lifted 91% of the counter-tariffs.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;May 10-11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;US-China talks in Geneva, reaching a joint statement on suspending tariffs by 24% (90 days).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;four-timeline-summary-5&#34;&gt;Four. Timeline Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;May 12th&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Both sides announced a suspension of tariffs and the establishment of a consultation mechanism, easing trade tensions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;five-trends-and-challenges&#34;&gt;Five. Trends and Challenges
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Term Relief and Long-Term Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; The suspension of US-China tariffs sent positive signals, but structural issues (such as high technology and energy) remain, with midterm elections or policy continuity impacting the medium term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Supply Chain Restructuring:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies are accelerating adjustments to their supply chains, with Mexico and Southeast Asia benefiting from “nearshoring,” but rising costs may dampen recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilateral Mechanism Dilemmas:&lt;/strong&gt; The WTO dispute resolution mechanism is limited, regional trade agreements (such as the US-UK agreement) are emerging as alternative options, but this could exacerbate fragmentation.&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;2020-2025 Years: The recruitment of teachers in Jiangxi Province shows a significant reduction trend: the number of specially appointed teachers decreased sharply from 6,617 to 32 (a decrease of 99.5%), and the number of national cadre teachers decreased from 11,324 to 2,146 (a decrease of 81.1%). The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, mathematics, and English) remained stable but declined in total volume; while the proportions of music, art, and physical education increased, the absolute number was limited (e.g., in 2025, they were only recruited 2 people each). Policy-wise, “one withdrawal, one replacement” personnel adjustments have tightened, with teacher resources leaning towards vocational training and remote areas, traditional primary and secondary school positions have significantly reduced, and some subjects plan for zero recruitment in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruitment numbers of specially appointed teachers in Jiangxi Province over the past five years have been collected and compiled into a table, categorized by subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— ——————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on recruitment announcements and publicly available data released by the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and other official agencies, the following summarizes the recruitment situation for contracted teachers and civil servant teachers from 2020-2025. Please note that &lt;strong&gt;2025 data represents planned recruitment numbers&lt;/strong&gt;, and some years’ subject breakdowns are not fully disclosed; subjects marked as “unspecified” in the table represent total figures or missing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-data-description&#34;&gt;III. Data Description
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Source&lt;/strong&gt;: Recruitment announcements and official statistics from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education and the Department of Human Resources and Social Security for the past years (actual recruitment numbers for 2020-2024, planned numbers for 2025).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject Categories&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special Post Teachers focus on subjects at rural primary education stages; only a small number of subject posts are retained in 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Personnel Teachers cover all academic levels and have a more comprehensive curriculum, including preschool education and special education (due to data not being segmented, these were not listed separately).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trend Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharp Decline in Total Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;: The recruitment quota for Special Post Teachers decreased by 99.5% compared to 2020 in 2025, and the recruitment quota for National Personnel Teachers decreased by 81.1%, reflecting demographic changes and adjustments to educational resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot vs. Cold Subjects&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, Mathematics, English) remained stable but declined year on year in terms of recruitment numbers. - The proportion of disciplines such as Audio-Visual Arts, Information Technology, etc., is rising, but the absolute number remains limited (e.g., only 2 people recruited in Audio-Visual Arts each year by 2025).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some subjects (such as English) are facing suspensions due to declining student numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Background:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightening of Enrollment:&lt;/strong&gt; Implementing a “withdraw one, fill one” policy, strictly controlling the addition of new positions, with external positions accounting for 68.6% in 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Adjustment:&lt;/strong&gt; Teacher resources are leaning towards vocational education and remote areas, while recruitment in traditional primary and secondary schools has significantly decreased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Merge the Pull Request into the Repository of the Fork</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/merge-pullrequest-to-fork-repository/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;github-readme-stats&lt;/code&gt; is a GitHub profile statistics generator that allows users to display various statistics and charts within their GitHub profiles. It offers multiple customization options to tailor it to user needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I manage my repository habits by grouping them by project; GitHub doesn&amp;rsquo;t support repository grouping, so I have to achieve this by splitting repositories across different organizations. The latest branch of &lt;code&gt;github-readme-stats&lt;/code&gt; cannot support statistics for repositories spanning different organizations; I forked a branch and merged the corresponding code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;merging-a-pull-request-into-your-forked-repository&#34;&gt;Merging a Pull Request into Your Forked Repository
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To merge a &lt;strong&gt;Pull Request (PR)&lt;/strong&gt; into your &lt;strong&gt;forked repository&lt;/strong&gt;, there are several ways to do this, depending on whether you want to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge the PR from the &lt;strong&gt;upstream repository&lt;/strong&gt; into your fork, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge a PR from another person’s fork into your fork, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge a PR that was opened on your fork (e.g., someone forked and created a PR for you)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll first give you a common scenario: &lt;strong&gt;You have forked a repository and want to merge a PR from the upstream into your fork&lt;/strong&gt;.  Here’s the workflow below 👇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-method-one-command-line-most-universal&#34;&gt;✅ Method One: Command Line (Most Universal)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-1-clone-your-own-fork&#34;&gt;Step 1: Clone your own fork
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-2-add-upstream-original-repository-address&#34;&gt;Step 2: Add upstream (original repository address)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-3-fetch-the-upstream-pr-branch&#34;&gt;Step 3: Fetch the Upstream PR Branch
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the PR number you want to merge, such as PR #123.
You can then checkout the code for that PR like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-4-switch-and-merge-branches&#34;&gt;Step 4: Switch and Merge Branches
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If everything is working correctly, you can push your changes to your forked GitHub repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-method-two-github-web-interface-simple-but-limited&#34;&gt;✅ Method Two: GitHub Web Interface (Simple but Limited)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see a PR on GitHub’s web interface that is against the upstream repository, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the PR page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click “&lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt;” or “&lt;strong&gt;Files changed&lt;/strong&gt;” in the top-right corner to see which branch this PR is based on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On your fork page, create a new branch and then manually cherry-pick the PR’s commit (requires Git knowledge).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or, click “&lt;strong&gt;Open in GitHub Desktop&lt;/strong&gt;” and use the GUI tool to merge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-if-someone-has-created-a-fork-and-submitted-a-pr-to-it-simply-navigate-to-the-pr-page-click-the-merge-pull-request-button-and-youre-done&#34;&gt;🚀 If someone has created a fork and submitted a PR to it, simply navigate to the PR page, click the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Merge pull request&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; button, and you’re done.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like me to walk you through it step-by-step based on your specific scenario (e.g., PR link, whether you&amp;rsquo;re using a web interface or command line)? Or, please provide the link and I can analyze the simplest approach for you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Commit messages in Git’s history</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-modify-commit-message/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 18:38:31 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-modify-commit-message/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Script to batch modify Git history commit author information, rewriting the Git history records using &lt;code&gt;git filter-branch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script you provided is used to batch modify the author information in the Git repository history. The overall approach is correct, but using an array (like &lt;code&gt;OLD_EMAILS=(&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;) within the &lt;code&gt;git filter-branch&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;--env-filter&lt;/code&gt; might cause compatibility issues because some shell environments (such as &lt;code&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;) do not support array syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve compatibility, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to replace the array with a string separated by spaces and iterate through each old email address using a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop. Here’s an example of the modified script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is highly recommended to back up your repository before executing this script to prevent any unforeseen issues. - This operation will rewrite Git history, modifying commit author information and may cause the commit hash values to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have already pushed your changes to a remote repository, you need to use a forced push:
Please exercise caution when using forced pushes, especially in collaborative projects, to avoid impacting others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count all unique authors&amp;rsquo; email addresses in the repository&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The “Tiangong” (Heavenly Palace) incident in medical education and the Butterfly Effect of Dong Xi Ying’s case</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-sky-dong-xiying-butterfly-effect/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 01:08:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-sky-dong-xiying-butterfly-effect/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Beijing Children’s Hospital “4+4” project (4 years non-medical bachelor&amp;rsquo;s + 4 years medical doctorate) focuses on interdisciplinary elite cultivation. The exposure of Dong Xi Ying’s case in 2025 revealed her leveraging family background (medical/scientific research lineage) to enter the program, raising concerns about the ambiguity of her qualifications, allegations of plagiarism in her dissertation, and exposing a conflict between the project&amp;rsquo;s elite recruitment model and fairness. Issues regarding shortened study durations and internship training remain unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompts&#34;&gt;Prompts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog: Harmony 4+4 Origin and Development, Core: A Corner of Tian Gong, Seen by Mortals, Dong Xiaojie&amp;rsquo;s Family Background, Normal Medical Doctor Cannot Graduate in Eight Years, Dong Xiaojie’s Family and Educational Background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harmony-44-deconstructing-medical-educations-tian-gong&#34;&gt;Harmony 4+4: Deconstructing Medical Education&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Tian Gong&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “4+4” project at the Beijing Union Medical College, since its launch in 2018, has been viewed as China’s “Tian Gong” – or celestial palace – in medical education. This project, designed to mimic the American medical education system, adopted the philosophy of “cultivating multidisciplinary individuals, nurturing loving doctors, and attracting outstanding talents from across the nation.” It aimed to create a rift within traditional Chinese medical education by: &lt;strong&gt;replacing the traditional 5+3+3 (five-year bachelor’s degree + three-year master’s degree + three-year doctoral degree) model with a four-year non-medical undergraduate program plus a four-year medical doctorate training.&lt;/strong&gt; This was intended to cultivate cross-disciplinary leadership talent in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project&amp;rsquo;s “Tian Gong” attributes are reflected across three dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elite Recruitment:&lt;/strong&gt; Early requirements stipulated that applicants must come from QS/Times/US News top 50 universities or US News’s top 10 liberal arts colleges (such as Barnard College), later relaxed to the top 100, but still requiring a GPA of 3.6 or being within the top 30% of their class. &lt;strong&gt;Internationalization of Learning Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopting an organ-system integration curriculum in the American style, PBL (Problem-Based Learning) methodology, students must complete core courses such as anatomy and pathology within 4 years, and participate in clinical internships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controversy Regarding Export Quality:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the pass rate for practicing physicians (95.2%) is slightly lower than that of traditional eight-year programs (98.5%), graduates predominantly enter affiliated hospitals, and their career development shows no significant difference from traditional pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dong-xiying-incident-a-celestial-realm-crack-revealed-by-ordinary-eyes&#34;&gt;Dong Xiying Incident: A &amp;ldquo;Celestial Realm&amp;rdquo; Crack Revealed by Ordinary Eyes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, the extramarital affair involving Xiao Fei, a thoracic surgeon at Zhongdayu Hospital, and his wife was reported, inadvertently exposing the “mysterious veil” of the 4+4 project at Xinhua Hospital. The background of Dong Xiying, the person involved, sparked three key questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambiguity Regarding Educational Background:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Over Undergraduate Institution:&lt;/strong&gt; Dong Xiying claimed to have graduated from Columbia University, but actually attended Barnard College (ranked 14th in US News &amp;amp; World Report for liberal arts colleges in 2025). Although the school met Xinhua Hospital’s requirement of “top 20 liberal arts colleges,” its diploma simultaneously listed &amp;ldquo;Barnard College&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Columbia University,&amp;rdquo; which could be easily misinterpreted as Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s main campus in the domestic recruitment market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Over Professional Field:&lt;/strong&gt; An economics undergraduate degree combined with a clinical medicine doctorate path, while aligning with the 4+4 project’s positioning of “multi-disciplinary background,” was questioned for lacking foundational courses in pre-medical studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dong-xi-ying-incident-peering-through-the-heavenly-palace-crack--a-glimpse-for-ordinary-people&#34;&gt;Dong Xi Ying Incident: Peering Through the &amp;ldquo;Heavenly Palace&amp;rdquo; Crack – A Glimpse for Ordinary People
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Family Background:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academic Resource Monopoly:&lt;/strong&gt; Her father was the secretary of the China Metallurgical and Research Institute, her mother was a deputy director of the North Science University Engineering Technology Research Institute, her grandfather was an academician in the imaging field of Xinhua Medical Institution, and her uncle and aunt were foreign academicians in the materials field at North Science University. This “medicine + research + university” composite family background provided implicit resources such as recommendation letters (requiring recommendations from two biomedical associate professors) and research collaborations (such as North Science University patents).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career Path Leaps:&lt;/strong&gt; She transitioned from cardiac surgery during residency to urology, with research spanning orthopedics, gastroenterology, radiology, and other fields. This was questioned as “paved road” due to the rapid changes in her career path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exaggerated Controversy Over Study Duration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasonableness of Time Compression:&lt;/strong&gt; Traditional medical doctorates require 11 years (5+3+3), while the 4+4 program compressed the time to 8 years. Despite Harmony emphasizing “curriculum integration” and “early clinical exposure,” some physicians pointed out that its clinical internship period (12 months) is still less than the traditional eight-year program (18 months), potentially impacting skill accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Controversy Regarding CCT Reduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Some CCT bases allowing 4+4 graduates to have a year of CCT reduced are being questioned for undermining industry fairness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-medical-education-quagmire-behind-the-controversy&#34;&gt;The Medical Education Quagmire Behind the Controversy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dong Xiying incident reflects deep contradictions within Chinese medical education:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict between Elitism and Equity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “application-assessment” model of the 4+4 program is essentially a transplant of the American medical school model, but China lacks standardized exams like MCAT, relying instead on subjective evaluations such as recommendations and research experience, which are significantly influenced by family background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data shows that among graduates of the 4+4 program in 2023, 30% came from Qingbei Fuzhou (the top universities), and 25% from overseas prestigious schools. The influence of family background on applications is significant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reality of Curriculum Reform:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cost of Time Compression:&lt;/strong&gt; 4+4 students produce significantly fewer research outputs (such as the number of publications) than traditional eight-year programs, and are accused of “prioritizing clinical work over research.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divergence in Industry Recognition:&lt;/strong&gt; Three-tier hospitals prioritize the reputation of Covance (the name of the top medical school), while基层医院 (jīchéng yīyuàn – primary hospitals) maintain a cautious attitude towards the clinical abilities of 4+4 graduates. - &lt;strong&gt;The Confusion Surrounding the International Integration of Medical Education&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US 4+4 model requires passing the MCAT exam and completing a 3-7 year residency, while China’s 4+4 programs have simplified the entry and residency stages, leading to “form resembling but not being” the real thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data from the Ministry of Education shows that in 2024, 4+4 programs accounted for less than 5% of national medical doctorate admissions, and their large-scale promotion still faces resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-reconstructing-the-tiangong-order-of-medical-education&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Reconstructing the &amp;ldquo;Tiangong&amp;rdquo; Order of Medical Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding the CoHo 4+4 project fundamentally represents a clash between elite education and public expectations. When a corner of the “Tiangong” (Heavenly Palace) was glimpsed by mortals, it exposed not just isolated instances of flaws, but deeper contradictions within the entire medical education system. Future reforms must focus on three levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparent Selection Mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; Introduce standardized exams (such as a Chinese version of MCAT) to reduce the influence of subjective factors like letters of recommendation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extend Clinical Training Cycle:&lt;/strong&gt; Restore the clinical training cycle for 4+4 graduates to 3 years, ensuring that clinical competence is achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen Process Oversight:&lt;/strong&gt; Establish an academic integrity review mechanism and conduct rigorous originality verification for interdisciplinary research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical education’s “Tiangong” should not be a privilege reserved for a select few, but rather a true cradle for nurturing medical elites.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tariff storm, stock market crash</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/tariffs-storm-stock-market-crash/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 03:49:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/tariffs-storm-stock-market-crash/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the global stock markets have experienced significant volatility, primarily due to new measures announced by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding a new round of comprehensive tariffs, which has triggered market concerns about a global trade war and economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariff Policy Sparks Market Panic&lt;/strong&gt;
President Trump announced last week the imposition of high tariffs on all imported goods, with up to 50% tariffs added on imports from China, aimed at correcting what he termed an unfair global trading system. This move led to panic selling across global markets as investors worried that escalating trade tensions would stifle global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Stock Markets Plunge Sharply&lt;/strong&gt;
In the United States, major indices suffered heavy losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,200 points, the Nasdaq Composite declined by 4%, and the S&amp;amp;P 500 dropped 3.8%, entering bear market territory. Asia and Europe were no exception, with the Nikkei 225 in Japan down nearly 8% and European stocks down 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investors Seek Safe-Haven Assets&lt;/strong&gt;
Faced with market turmoil, investors have been turning to safe-haven assets such as bonds and the Japanese yen. However, the VIX (Volatility Index) surged to above 60, indicating heightened market panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economists Warn of Stagnation Risk&lt;/strong&gt;
Economists warn that trade policies could lead the U.S. economy into “stagflation” – a situation where economic growth stagnates, inflation rises, and unemployment remains high.  JPMorgan has raised the probability of a US recession in 2025 to 60%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reactions from Governments and Corporations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments around the world have indicated they will take retaliatory measures. For example, the European Union’s trade chief stated that tariffs would be imposed on U.S. goods starting April 15th. Businesses have also expressed concerns, with Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs raising the probability of a U.S. economic recession to 45%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the global market is facing unprecedented challenges, and investors must closely monitor trade policy developments and market fluctuations, and implement effective risk management and asset allocation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Feeling bored and wanting to design a Chinese ink wash style theme.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-ink-style-theme/</link>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-ink-style-theme/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve gotten tired of staring at colorful, cluttered homepages and suddenly want to go for a minimalist style, designing a Chinese ink wash theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the current stylesheet is heavily customized, with specific styles configured to override the default theme styles for different elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without refactoring, I tried using AI directly to generate a new theme, and the results were very unstable.  Coincidentally, I also encountered a queue for trae claude large language model switching to vscode agent mode, which resulted in even worse effects – the generated output had no design sense whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that I don’t fully understand front-end development and can&amp;rsquo;t effectively break down tasks and hand them over to AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve always wanted to do things, like buying a suitable blue-chip stock and just letting it sit, waiting for it to drop so I could assess the situation before adding more, and selling when it rose. The result was that I never managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding an appropriate blue-chip stock is troublesome; it’s better to choose a broad market index ETF. Currently, my plan is to invest in a brokerage ETF and the Hong Kong Technology Index ETF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of trading strategy described above has a professional name: bottom fishing (buying back during a leftward decline).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the next step, I plan to select a broad market index to thoroughly practice it – achieving an annualized return that outperforms the regular savings account interest rate is the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brokerage-etfs&#34;&gt;Brokerage ETFs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brokerage ETF is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) primarily invested in Chinese securities companies as the main investment target. It mainly invests in the listed stocks of Chinese securities companies in the stock market. Brokerage ETFs typically track a specific brokerage company index, such as the China Securities Brokerage Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I previously bought it once, but at that time I was chasing highs and ultimately suffered losses, so I liquidated the position. The Chinese market – whenever there’s a bull run, brokerage companies are bound to rise, and how much they will rise depends on investors&amp;rsquo; emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-tech-index&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Tech Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index is an equity index launched by the Hong Kong Exchange, designed to reflect the overall performance of the technology industry in Hong Kong markets. The index includes major technology companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, covering areas such as internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 20, 2025, the top ten constituent stocks of the Hang Seng Tech Index (code: 800700) and their weightings are listed below (data sourced from multiple authoritative sources):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi Group-W&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://01810.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;01810.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 8.82%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tencent Holdings&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://00700.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;00700.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 8.14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba-W&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09988.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09988.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 7.72%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JD Group-SW&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09618.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09618.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 7.60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan-W&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://03690.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;03690.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 7.35%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kuaishou-W&lt;/strong&gt; ([01024.HK](http://01024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-tech-index-1&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Tech Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASML Holding&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://00981.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;00981.HK&lt;/a&gt;): Approx. 5.70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NetEase-S&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09999.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09999.HK&lt;/a&gt;): Approx. 4.59%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ctrip Group-S&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09961.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09961.HK&lt;/a&gt;): Approx. 4.48%
&lt;strong&gt;Total Percentage:&lt;/strong&gt; Approx. 66.6% (Note: Some sources show the top ten combined percentage between 68%-69%, due to differences in statistical timing points.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-notes&#34;&gt;Key Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight Cap Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;: The Hang Seng Tech Index sets an 8% weight limit for individual stocks. For example, before the adjustment on March 2025, SMIC’s weighting exceeded 8%, but was subsequently passively reduced to comply with the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constituent Stock Adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;: On May 16, 2025, the Hang Seng Index Company announced that BYD ( &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://01211.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;01211.HK&lt;/a&gt; ) will be included in the index and Guolian Group (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://00772.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;00772.HK&lt;/a&gt;) will be excluded. The adjustment will take effect on June 6th. Therefore, as of today (May 20th), the constituent stocks are still based on the pre-adjustment list, and BYD has not yet been included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry Distribution&lt;/strong&gt;: Among the top ten constituent stocks, internet technology companies (such as Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan) dominate, with significant weights in new energy vehicles (Xiaomi, Ideal) and semiconductors (SMIC), reflecting the index’s coverage of technology and the new economy. &lt;strong&gt;Data Timeliness:&lt;/strong&gt; The primary differences in data from various sources stem from differing statistical time points. For example, data from March 2025 showed a combined top ten share of approximately 69.4%, while data from May 14th indicated 68.82%, reflecting the dynamic impact of market fluctuations on the weighting distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;short-put-cover&#34;&gt;Short Put Cover
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Short Put Cover” strategy is an investment approach where investors, anticipating a stock price nearing its bottom as it continues to decline, actively buy in batches to reduce their average cost basis, waiting for future price recovery and profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method falls under the category of “Short Trading,” which involves counter-trend operations before the market has clearly established a bottom. Specifically, investors typically employ a “pyramid” or stepped-up buying strategy, gradually increasing the quantity purchased as the stock price declines to dilute the average cost basis. For example, initially purchasing a certain number of shares, if the price continues to fall, the investor increases the purchase volume at a lower price, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce Cost Basis:&lt;/strong&gt; By buying in batches during the decline, the average cost basis is diluted, creating conditions for future profits. - &lt;strong&gt;Pre-positioning:&lt;/strong&gt; Establishing positions before the market reverses, aiming to secure larger profits when the market rebounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; If stock prices continue to fall, it could lead to greater losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Tie-up:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires sufficient funds to continuously add to positions and may face the risk of capital being long-term trapped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively speaking, “right-side trading” involves buying after market trends become clear and there are definite signs of a price rebound, which carries lower risk but could miss out on initial gains during a rally. Therefore, investors should choose a suitable trading strategy based on their risk tolerance, financial situation, and market judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory&#34;&gt;Valuation Theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuation theory is a core concept in finance that aims to assess the intrinsic value of assets or companies, providing a basis for investment decisions. Through valuation, investors can determine whether the current market price of an asset is reasonable and develop appropriate investment strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Valuation Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by an asset over its future period and discounts these cash flows to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The DCF method emphasizes intrinsic value and is suitable for evaluating companies with stable and predictable earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative Valuation Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method assesses a company&amp;rsquo;s relative value by comparing valuation metrics such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, and Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio with those of other companies in the same industry. - Relative Valuation Method is straightforward to operate, widely used for rapid assessment and comparison within the same industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asset Basis Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method determines a company’s value by evaluating its net assets – total assets minus liabilities. The Asset Basis Method is suitable for asset-driven companies such as real estate firms or capital-intensive businesses.
&lt;strong&gt;Application of Valuation Theories:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Decisions:&lt;/strong&gt; Through valuation, investors can identify undervalued or overvalued assets and develop buy or sell strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate Mergers &amp;amp; Acquisitions:&lt;/strong&gt; In M&amp;amp;A transactions, valuation is key to determining the transaction price and influences the success or failure of the deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory-1&#34;&gt;Valuation Theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Reporting:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies need to assess the fair value of their assets and liabilities to ensure the accuracy and transparency of financial statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that valuation results are influenced by various factors, including market conditions, company operations, macroeconomic indicators, etc. Therefore, when conducting a valuation, it is necessary to consider all factors comprehensively and combine qualitative and quantitative analysis to obtain a more accurate assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No coding, design and develop a self-selected stock module.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/no-code-design-develop-custom-stock-module/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:20:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/no-code-design-develop-custom-stock-module/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last month, we experimented with cursor, but due to the limitations of the free quota, we didn&amp;rsquo;t develop overly complex features; we just did some basic testing. We discovered then that Byte also released similar products, both using the same large models – Claude-3.5 – at their core.
Byte’s product is called Trae, initially launched in the Mac version and finally released its Windows version in February of this year. Big companies are good because you can freely “white嫖” (literally translates to &amp;ldquo;free grab&amp;rdquo;) without paying; you get unlimited use of Claude-3.5. The performance of this model is quite impressive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we got stuck on the development of candlestick charts. As I don’t understand React at all, I had to give up. To continue developing, I would need to supplement my knowledge of front-end basics, breaking down the task into smaller, more manageable pieces instead of directly giving me a large task: developing candlestick charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;issues-found&#34;&gt;Issues Found
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the limited training data caused by using foreign AI models and Vue3 + Element-Plus, React was chosen as the frontend framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There may be occasional syntax errors requiring manual fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solutions for some complex problems require manual guidance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code structure optimization requires manual instruction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most time-consuming part was packaging the frontend code into a container, due to my zero experience with &lt;code&gt;.env.production&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tsconfig.json&lt;/code&gt;, I had no concept of these either; I sought help from community members along the way to sort out the corresponding logic. There are significant differences between the development and build modes in frontend development, and the checks performed on the code. Backend database and service container scripts were completed in a total of five minutes.
&lt;strong&gt;Currently, AI primarily improves development efficiency. Having a foundation is best; it won’t solve all problems for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;repository-address&#34;&gt;Repository Address
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the title indicates, this time we&amp;rsquo;re going to chat with AI without actually coding and see what we can achieve.  Let’s take a look at the final outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repository Address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/trae-demo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/ttf248/trae-demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the README.md file in the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository contains numerous submission records, most of which are dialogues between me and Trae, as well as my testing of Trae’s functionalities, with notes on whether manual intervention was required to implement each feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt&#34;&gt;Prompt
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project is created from scratch, below is the project prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ui-and-interaction-optimization&#34;&gt;UI and Interaction Optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design of the front-end interface relies entirely on Grok. We initially created a prototype within Trae, but it lacked aesthetics. Because the model used has strong coding capabilities but weaker other abilities, we need to use Grok to optimize the front-end UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking screenshots of the current interface and uploading them to Grok, we can obtain numerous optimization suggestions at once. We then manually evaluate these suggestions and copy them into Trae to execute and observe the results of the optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;technology-stack&#34;&gt;Technology Stack
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend: React + TypeScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backend: Golang + Gin + GORM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database: PostgreSQL 17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;system-architecture&#34;&gt;System Architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;backend-architecture&#34;&gt;Backend Architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backend utilizes the Gin framework (Go) to implement RESTful APIs, with the following key modules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database Module&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilizes GORM as an ORM framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports database connection configuration via environment variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically performs database schema migrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routing Module&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RESTful API design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A unified error handling mechanism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in request logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Origin Handling&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports cross-origin requests from local development environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configurable CORS policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports cookie-based cross-origin access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;frontend-architecture&#34;&gt;Frontend Architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frontend was built using React + TypeScript, implementing the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stock list display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watchlist management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-time quote data display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error handling mechanism&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>AI Development Over Two Years: Somewhat similar to the state before a Docker release – chaotic and rapidly evolving.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-docker-pre-release/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:16:37 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-docker-pre-release/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been one of the most hotly debated topics in the technology field in recent years, particularly over the past two years, with AI technology experiencing rapid advancements. Whether it’s deep learning, natural language processing, or computer vision and automated decision systems, the application scenarios for AI are constantly emerging. However, despite continuous technological breakthroughs, AI still faces a bottleneck similar to that of a Docker release – a lack of a killer app to truly ignite the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article: AI has developed for two years, which is somewhat similar to the state of a Docker release before publishing, lacking a killer application, and using existing technologies to create a perfect landing scenario. Docker did not use too many new technologies, but the overall solution is reasonable and changes the workflow of operations and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-development-status-the-technology-is-mature-but-applications-still-need-breakthroughs&#34;&gt;AI Development Status: The Technology is Mature, but Applications Still Need Breakthroughs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, AI has made significant progress in the past two years. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s OpenAI’s GPT series models or Google’s BERT and DeepMind’s Alpha series, AI processing capabilities have far exceeded previous expectations. Particularly in the field of natural language processing, models like GPT-4 not only possess powerful generative abilities but also demonstrate astonishing performance in understanding and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite technological advancements, AI&amp;rsquo;s implementation in practical applications faces certain challenges. Similar to Docker’s state before its release, although AI has enormous potential, there hasn’t yet been a truly widespread and industry-changing killer app. People are talking about the future of AI, but they may not be able to find a directly revolutionary application scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker-and-ai-parallels-technology-doesnt-have-to-be-innovation-its-about-the-solution&#34;&gt;Docker and AI Parallels: Technology Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Have to Be Innovation, It’s About the Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the history leading up to Docker’s release, we can readily see many similarities between the technological environment at that time and the current state of AI development. Before Docker, container technology wasn’t a new concept; early technologies like LXC (Linux Containers) and virtualization already possessed the basic capabilities for containerization. However, Docker didn&amp;rsquo;t introduce disruptive technology itself. Instead, it presented a simpler, more intuitive, and efficient solution through the clever integration and optimization of existing technologies. This solution didn’t bring about revolutionary technology, but it addressed many pain points in operations and development processes, significantly simplifying software deployment, scaling, and management workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the AI field is facing a similar situation. Currently, AI technology is no longer a “new thing,” but to truly achieve large-scale applications, it still requires a perfect landing scenario. Like Docker, integrating and optimizing existing technologies to form a reasonable application solution. A killer AI application may not rely on groundbreaking technological breakthroughs, but rather how to integrate existing technologies to solve pain points and needs in actual business operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-ais-docker-moment&#34;&gt;How to Find AI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Docker Moment&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly enable the widespread adoption of AI technology, we need to focus on several key areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Exploration of Real-World Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;
Currently, many AI applications are still primarily experimental in nature and lack large-scale real-world implementation. Areas such as AI customer service and intelligent recommendations are widely used, but their functionality is still limited and has not yet broken through industry bottlenecks. True breakthroughs may come from industries that have been plagued by traditional methods for a long time, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics. AI can help these companies improve efficiency and reduce costs in complex scenarios through more efficient data processing and predictive analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productization and Ease of Use&lt;/strong&gt;
Similar to how Docker simplifies containerization processes to increase operational efficiency, the ease of use of AI products is equally important. AI’s proliferation isn&amp;rsquo;t just about the spread of technology; it’s also about the proliferation of its products. Integrating AI into daily workflows, allowing users to easily utilize these tools without needing to deeply understand the underlying technology, is a crucial step in AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecosystem Building &amp;amp; Standardization&lt;/strong&gt;
Any new technology’s widespread application relies on ecosystem building. Docker’s rapid rise is due to its openness and compatibility, enabling developers to seamlessly integrate with various cloud platforms, tools, and services. Similarly, the future of AI depends on the construction of an ecosystem. The standardization of AI, model sharing, data openness, and technological interoperability will all influence whether AI can form widespread industry applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-the-future-of-ai-is-full-of-possibilities-but-requires-more-refined-implementation&#34;&gt;Conclusion: The Future of AI is Full of Possibilities, but Requires More Refined Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant advancements in AI technology over the past two years, it remains in the stage of “lacking killer applications” at present. Similar to containerization technology before Docker’s release, AI needs a reasonable application scenario that deeply integrates existing technologies with business requirements to truly achieve large-scale adoption and widespread use. While technological innovation is undoubtedly important, solutions that simplify processes and improve efficiency are more likely to drive the popularization and development of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, AI may evolve like Docker – not through disruptive technological breakthroughs, but by integrating existing technologies to create a perfect application scenario, ultimately changing the way we work and live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Protobuf Zero Value Pitfall: When Default Values Become an Invisible Killer of Business Logic</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/protobuf-zero-value-traps/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:26:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/protobuf-zero-value-traps/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The US stock market has three trading sessions: pre-market, live market, and post-market. The logic for pushing data – whether it’s full data streams or numerical increments – is optimized to conserve bandwidth (sending as little data as possible). Initially, only the full dataset is sent once, and subsequent transmissions are incremental updates of all fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not use the optimal solution? This involves multiple project teams, some of which have been live for many years. As we’re a new integration, we can only strive for compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-series-of-issues&#34;&gt;A Series of Issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just from the summary, it might seem like there aren&amp;rsquo;t any problems, but once the system architecture is brought in, a series of issues arise. Immediately after resolving the previous issue, a new one emerged – this problem was caused by the prior one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unable-to-identify-trading-intervals&#34;&gt;Unable to Identify Trading Intervals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market phase is defined in &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; as 0, but because it’s received via incremental push, the business side cannot effectively determine whether this ‘0’ represents the default value or a genuine business value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms: Each time a &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; is received, it’s impossible to discern whether it’s the new market phase setting or the &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; default value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introducing-optional&#34;&gt;Introducing Optional
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since protobuf release 3.15, proto3 supports using the optional keyword (just as in proto2) to provide presence information for a scalar field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group’s communication protocol is based on &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;, but due to historical reasons, the version selected was older and did not support the &lt;code&gt;optional&lt;/code&gt; keyword. As you know, because we introduced &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; from the ground up, publishing the project as a static library, this resulted in needing to upgrade the entire build chain, which was a very high cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gcc-version-issues&#34;&gt;GCC Version Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After painstakingly devising a solution, we planned to release two different underlying versions to control the propagation of dependencies for the new &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; version as much as possible. However, during compilation, we discovered that the &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version was too low and did not support the new features of &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commonly used server types within our team are CentOS7 and CentOS8. The default &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version on CentOS7 is 4.8, while the default &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version on CentOS8 is 8.3. Since the new features of &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; require a &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; version of 7.4 or higher, CentOS7 could not support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=82461&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bug 82461 - [7 Regression] Temporary required for brace-initializing (non-literal-type) member variable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, after a lot of troubleshooting, we moved the deployments of related services and the compilation server to CentOS8, resolving this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reasonable-enumeration&#34;&gt;Reasonable Enumeration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the entire problem, there’s a simpler and more efficient solution: adjust the enumeration definition to start numbering from 1 instead of 0. This effectively distinguishes between default values and business values, avoiding all the aforementioned issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-starting-from-1-is-more-reasonable&#34;&gt;Why Starting from 1 is More Reasonable?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;, enum types have a default value fixed to 0. If we define meaningful business values as 0 (e.g., &amp;ldquo;Market Open&amp;rdquo;), in incremental pushes, the business side cannot determine whether the received 0 is a business value or an unset default value.  If instead, we defined the enum starting from 1, 0 could be retained as a meaningless default value or “Unknown” state, resolving the issue neatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended Practice:
When designing &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt; enums, always define 0 as a meaningless default value (e.g., &lt;code&gt;UNKNOWN&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;RESERVED&lt;/code&gt;).
Assign actual business values starting from 1 to ensure they are distinguished from the default value of 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this small adjustment, we not only resolved the issue of identifying trading hours but also provided a valuable lesson for future protocol design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Golden Week and National Day holiday periods saw the stock market’s “ice and fire dichotomy”: dramatic swings between soaring gains and sharp declines.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/national-holiday-stock-market-rollercoaster/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:42:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/national-holiday-stock-market-rollercoaster/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the eve of China’s National Day in 2024, the stock market experienced a remarkable surge, attracting considerable attention. However, following the holiday, the market unexpectedly turned to a dramatic plunge. This “polarization” of the stock market – a rollercoaster ride between soaring highs and plummeting lows – not only subjected investors to a thrilling yet nerve-wracking experience, but also prompted deep reflection on policy, economics, and market fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Insert relevant news snippets and data visualizations here - this section would be populated with actual content for a blog post]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-national-day-stock-surge-a-policy-driven-frenzy&#34;&gt;Pre-National Day Stock Surge: A Policy-Driven Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the five trading days leading up to National Day, China’s stock market surged from a slump into “boiling mode.” On September 30th, the A-share market saw a full-scale rally with all indices hitting historic highs. The Shanghai Composite Index rose by 8.06%, the Shenzhen Component Index increased by 10.67%, and the ChiNext Board Index soared by 15.36%, with the Northern China Securities Exchange 50 Index setting a record for the largest single-day rise, jumping 22.84%. Market sentiment was extremely exuberant, with daily trading volumes across the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing Stock Exchanges reaching RMB 2611.5 billion, a significant increase of RMB 1155.9 billion compared to the previous trading day. More than 5300 stocks on the main board rallied collectively, creating a “sea of red.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving force behind this rally was the concentrated release of a series of unexpectedly positive policies by the government and the resulting changes in market expectations. On September 24th, the People’s Bank of China announced a cut in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) and interest rates, reducing the interest rates on existing mortgages, and unified the minimum down payment ratios for mortgages. At the Central Political Bureau meeting on September 26th, it was emphasized that efforts should be made to intensify counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policy adjustments, strive to boost capital markets, and actively guide medium and long-term funds into investment. On September 30th, a series of ten real estate support policies were released. These policy measures conveyed the government’s firm determination to stabilize the market and promote growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-national-day-stock-market-plunge-calm-and-adjustment-after-the-frenzy&#34;&gt;Post-National Day Stock Market Plunge: Calm and Adjustment After the Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, market sentiment plummeted sharply after the National Day holiday. On October 8th, the A-share market opened strongly with nearly a limit-up rise, but following a significant high opening, the market experienced violent fluctuations before closing down. Since then, the market’s center of gravity has continuously shifted downwards, and as of October 16th, the Shanghai Composite Index rose and fell by more than 15%, cumulatively falling by over 470 points. From October 8th to 10th, core A-share indices all declined, with the Shenzhen Component Index down 6.21%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this plunge are multifaceted, on one hand, digesting the accumulated risks from a rapid rise in the previous period, and on the other hand, related to adjustments in market expectations regarding policy. Some investors believe that the short-term effects of policies have become apparent, but the long-term effects still need to be observed. Furthermore, fluctuations in global markets also impacted A-shares. On October 9th, the Hang Seng Index plunged by 9.41%, and A50 futures fell by 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflection-and-outlook-on-the-market&#34;&gt;Reflection and Outlook on the Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dramatic fluctuations in the stock market around National Day highlighted a deep reflection among investors regarding policy, economics, and market rules. On one hand, the short-term stimulus effects of policies were significant, but their long-term impact remains to be observed. On the other hand, the rapid rise and fall of the market served as a reminder for investors to maintain rationality and avoid emotional investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, whether A-shares can usher in a genuine “long bull” market depends on whether policy can effectively transmit to the real economy and ultimately drive substantive improvements in economic fundamentals. Investors should closely monitor the specific implementation of policies and changes in economic data to rationally adjust their investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp rallies and crashes in the stock market around National Day were a game between policy and the market, and also a test of investors’ mentality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Spring Festival box office *Ne Zha* goes viral/breaks out</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-nizha-breakthrough/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:40:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-nizha-breakthrough/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation of the provided Chinese text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As Chinese people, every Spring Festival, we gather with our families for reunion dinners and watching movies has become an indispensable entertainment activity. This year’s Spring Festival box office hit, &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt;, exploded out of its niche, sparking discussions on streets and in alleys. The scale is impressive, reminiscent of the previous blockbuster, &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, carrying a strong patriotic theme that inexplicably evoked a sense of national pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article, topic: The explosive popularity of &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt; at the Spring Festival box office, the inexplicable sense of national pride, similar to older films like &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, with a patriotic theme. While there has been significant progress, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t reached this level. As gamers, many aspects seem greasy, and the combat scenes are heavily influenced by online games. There have already been people who bought movie tickets for &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt; but didn’t actually watch it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-combat-scenes-lacked-a-certain-feel&#34;&gt;The combat scenes lacked a certain feel.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a gamer, I spend most of my time immersed in various online games, so I didn’t have high expectations for movies. However, with the immense popularity of &lt;em&gt;The Battle Between Heaven and Earth&lt;/em&gt;, everyone around me was talking about it, and I thought, “Let me take a look.” When I entered the cinema, as soon as the screen came on, my heart sank. Although the production quality had improved compared to before, some scenes looked a bit greasy. Specifically, the combat scenes… well, they were too heavily influenced by games. Having played so many years of games, these visuals and certain scenes felt too similar to what I was used to in games, lacking the texture and feel that a movie should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crazy-fanatics&#34;&gt;Crazy Fanatics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the movie, I went out to see what was happening online. Turns out, quite a few people said they bought tickets for &lt;em&gt;The Soul of the Demon&lt;/em&gt; purely to boost its box office revenue. This is impressive – I have to admit I’m somewhat impressed! It seems that everyone&amp;rsquo;s enthusiasm and support for this film is incredibly high, and they were willing to do something for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storyline&#34;&gt;Storyline
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s reflect on it: back when &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt; came out, Wu Jing shouted “Anyone who dares to harm China will be punished, no matter how far away,” and countless people felt a surge of patriotism, believing that our Chinese military was incredibly powerful and our country immensely strong. Although &lt;em&gt;The Battle Between Heaven and Earth&lt;/em&gt; didn’t have such a direct patriotic slogan, it vividly showcased traditional Chinese culture. Characters like Nezha and Ao Bing, mythological figures we&amp;rsquo;ve grown up hearing stories about since childhood, had their feuds, loves, and growth journeys depicted with flesh and blood in the film – isn’t that the charm of Chinese culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take Nezha as an example. He was misunderstood and ostracized from a young age, but he refused to give up, shouting “My destiny is not determined by others, but by myself,” which resonates so strongly with the resilience deep within every Chinese person. No matter what difficulties we face, we don&amp;rsquo;t bow down; we change our fate through our own efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advancements-in-animated-films&#34;&gt;Advancements in Animated Films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;The Fire on the Mountain&lt;/em&gt; (Nezha) had some imperfections, it effectively combined traditional Chinese culture with modern film techniques, allowing us to see significant progress in Chinese animated films. Just as &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated China’s breakthrough in the action film genre. This kind of advancement makes us feel that Chinese cinema can emerge onto the international stage and allows foreigners to witness the brilliance of Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chinese people, no matter where we go, we carry our nation and culture within us. Films like &lt;em&gt;Nezha&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt; are like keys that unlock the deep-seated sense of national pride within us. They allow us to feel the strength of our country and the charm of our culture while laughing and enjoying ourselves, inspiring us to work hard in our respective roles and contribute our share to the prosperity and flourishing of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Background Service TCP Communication Anomaly Troubleshooting</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:54:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Business Model: The backend service establishes a connection with the group’s market data gateway using TCP. Each time a connection is established, it must first send an authorization request and then continuously send heartbeat packages to maintain the connection status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one day, an alert message was received indicating that the service had disconnected. After carefully examining the logs, it was discovered that the backend service was continuously sending heartbeat packages, but the other party did not respond at all, yet the connection remained open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-site-summary&#34;&gt;On-Site Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was originally working late in the office to advance project progress when an alarm message suddenly popped up in our work group. At first glance, I thought it was just a recurring issue – likely due to network timeouts causing heartbeat failures, leading to service disconnection. However, after careful log examination, the actual situation turned out to be different. The backend had already sent authorization messages, but they hadn&amp;rsquo;t received any response; meanwhile, heartbeat packets were continuously being sent, yet the other party never replied with any heartbeat data. After in-depth analysis of the logs, several key issues were revealed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorization message without response: This was likely due to the other system being in the process of restarting, which prevented the authorization message from being processed promptly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sending heartbeat data despite unsuccessful authorization: Upon investigation, it was found that this was a logical flaw in the program’s logic. - The judgment logic of the heartbeat sending function has a defect; it only checks the connection status but misses verifying the authorization status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the service can disconnect, a reconnection mechanism can be triggered to resend the authorization message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently, there’s one remaining issue that urgently needs to be resolved: why doesn&amp;rsquo;t the service disconnect?  Solving this problem requires more in-depth and detailed troubleshooting work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analyzing-network-packets&#34;&gt;Analyzing Network Packets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; is a very powerful network packet capture tool that can be used to capture network packets. By analyzing network packets, we can gain a more intuitive understanding of the details of network communication. Here, we can use &lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; to capture network packets for further analysis.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/20250220151952.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1126&#34;
	height=&#34;202&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;tcpdump&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;557&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;1337px&#34;
	
&gt;
Analyzing the data in the diagram, I see that the heartbeat is constantly sending normally, and the other server hasn&amp;rsquo;t responded with any data, but it has sent an &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;, which prevents the connection from actively disconnecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;common-flag-bit-explanation&#34;&gt;Common Flag Bit Explanation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the TCP protocol, &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; (Push) and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; (Acknowledgment) are two important flag bits used to control data transmission and traffic confirmation, respectively. Their functions are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-psh-push-flag&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. PSH (Push Flag)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; flag’s purpose is to &lt;strong&gt;request that the receiver immediately push data from the buffer to the upper layer application&lt;/strong&gt; (rather than waiting for the buffer to fill). This means that once a data segment with the &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; flag is received, the receiver will process and transmit it as quickly as possible to the application, rather than storing it in an operating system buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical Scenarios:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP/HTTPS Requests:&lt;/strong&gt; Clients setting the &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; when sending requests (e.g., &lt;code&gt;GET /index.html&lt;/code&gt;) to ensure immediate response from the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSH Protocol:&lt;/strong&gt; Each keystroke triggers &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt;, ensuring real-time transmission of input characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Time Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; Low-latency scenarios like video streaming or online games may use &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; to reduce latency. - &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; is not mandatory; the receiver can choose to ignore this flag (but must still process the data correctly).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sender may not set &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt;; in this case, the receiver will determine when to push data based on its own buffering policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-ack-acknowledgment-flag&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. ACK (Acknowledgment Flag)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function:&lt;/strong&gt; The ACK flag indicates that the preceding data segment has been &lt;strong&gt;received correctly&lt;/strong&gt;. Each ACK contains an acknowledgment number (Acknowledgment Number), representing the expected next byte sequence number. It is the core mechanism of TCP reliable transmission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Principle:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the sender transmits a data segment, it carries the expected ACK value from the receiver (e.g., &lt;code&gt;ACK = Sequence Number + Data Length&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upon receiving the data, the receiver generates an ACK message to confirm the received byte sequence number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sender only retransmits unacknowledged data after receiving the corresponding ACK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the sender transmits a data segment with sequence numbers &lt;code&gt;100~199&lt;/code&gt;, then the expected ACK from the receiver should be &lt;code&gt;200&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-combination-of-psh-and-ack&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Combination of PSH and ACK&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the TCP header, &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; can appear simultaneously, commonly seen in the following scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTTP Request Response&lt;/strong&gt;:
When a client sends a &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; request (including data), it sets both &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; (to acknowledge previous responses).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command Transmission after SSH Handshake&lt;/strong&gt;:
After the client enters a command, it sends a data segment with both &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt; to ensure that the command is immediately transmitted and processed by the server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary

        <title>“Making an investment and making money isn’t urgent, and even if you’re anxious, it won’t help.”</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on years of stock trading experiences, although I didn’t make a fortune, I also didn&amp;rsquo;t lose too much. The biggest issue was an unreasonable allocation of funds and an unstable mindset. Currently, my primary source of income is work, earning a fixed salary each day through part-time jobs. My ability to withstand financial fluctuations remains at the level of bonds and bank deposits. However, people are inherently greedy; if you buy too little, even when prices rise, you won’t make money; if you buy too much, you will lose money. At this point, maintaining a stable mindset is particularly important, as it can help us keep our wealth afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article: Addressing the psychological issues in stock trading investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-loss-cases&#34;&gt;Historical Loss Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the initial entry into the market, I’ve encountered small-cap and near-new stocks. Later, my investments focused primarily on blue-chip large-cap stocks: Industrial Bank, China Unicom, HK Electronics, ZTESC, and various large index funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Expecting an annualized return of parlaying with hype about matching bank three-year fixed deposits,” in reality, it was driven by greed wanting more, rushing to add positions early on, and then exhausting cash flow later. Purchases of insurance, buying a house, and getting married all represented significant outflows of capital, leading to insufficient liquidity overall due to a lack of sufficient funds allocated within the broader plan. Buying blue chips is like aligning with “old money”—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Evergrande ran into trouble, bank stocks plummeted dramatically, successfully capitalizing on the opportunity to clear out positions. This reflects a deficiency in understanding for the broader economic market. The real estate sector accounts for too much of China’s economy, and any issues within it have far-reaching implications; it cannot be “force-landed,” leading to continued downward pressure on the stock market. Red-chip stocks like &lt;strong&gt;Industrial Bank&lt;/strong&gt; continued to rise for about two years after that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the initial stages of the trade war, &lt;strong&gt;Zhongxing Telecom&lt;/strong&gt; was severely impacted, and its stock price also fell sharply. It has since gradually recovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HSPE (Hubei Hongyu Precision Electronics)&lt;/strong&gt; is a legacy company; after Ant Financial withdrew, its stock price also plummeted significantly. However, this stock had a controlling shareholder manipulating it, allowing it to surge several times per year. With reasonable position control, losses can be minimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;greed-the-monster-devouring-reason&#34;&gt;Greed: The “Monster” Devouring Reason
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greed is the most common problem in a stock trading mentality.&lt;/strong&gt; When stock prices rise steadily, and investors’ account profits continuously increase, greed quietly takes root. Many people still fantasize about continued price increases even when stocks are already at high levels, craving more gains and unwilling to cut their profits. They are blinded by greed, forgetting the existence of market rules and risks. For example, during the hype of certain hot-topic stocks, some investors see prices double or even multiply within a short period, falling into it, constantly adding to their positions, hoping to be the last winner. However, the market will not always go crazy; when the bubble bursts and stock prices plummet sharply, these investors driven by greed often suffer heavy losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-the-chains-that-restrict&#34;&gt;Fear: The “Chains” That Restrict
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is the counterpart to greed. It possesses a powerful destructive force in the stock market as well. When market conditions suddenly reverse and stock prices plummet dramatically, investors are prone to panic. This fear erodes their confidence in the market, even when the fundamentals of their holdings are sound, leading them to hastily sell off their shares out of a fear of further losses. For example, during periods of global financial crises, even high-quality blue-chip stocks saw significant declines alongside the broader market. Some investors were consumed by fear and failed to recognize the long-term value of these companies, selling their stock at extremely low prices and missing out on the substantial returns that came with subsequent market rebounds and company performance growth. Fear not only causes short-term losses for investors but can also create a lasting psychological shadow over the stock market, causing them to be reluctant to re-enter investments, thereby losing opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blind-following-losing-direction-in-the-fog&#34;&gt;Blind Following: Losing Direction in the &amp;ldquo;Fog&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stock trading and wealth management, blindly following trends is another psychological pitfall that investors easily fall into. In an era of information explosion, all kinds of investment advice, market rumors, and hot topics are rampant. Many investors lack independent thinking and judgment abilities, blindly following others&amp;rsquo; operations. When they see their peers making money by buying a particular stock, they immediately follow suit without further thought; when they hear so-called &amp;ldquo;insider news,&amp;rdquo; they readily share it. This blind following behavior ignores the research and analysis of the underlying stocks, causing investors to be like lost ships in the fog, losing their own direction. For example, some momentum stocks can generate short-term gains for followers during the initial market hype. However, as the hype fades and stock prices plummet, those investors who don’t understand the situation and blindly follow become “pickup operators.” They fail to realize that each investor&amp;rsquo;s risk tolerance, investment objectives, and investment horizon are different; an investment strategy that works for others may not be suitable for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overconfidence-the-hidden-rocks&#34;&gt;Overconfidence: The Hidden “Rocks”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence is also a significant issue in the investment and financial mindset. Some investors, after achieving several successful investments, begin to inflate their egos, believing they have mastered market patterns and can accurately predict stock movements. They ignore the complexity and uncertainty of the market, engage in excessive trading, blindly expand their investment scale, and even use high leverage for speculation. However, the market is ever-changing, and overconfident investors often suffer severe setbacks in a single unexpected market fluctuation. For example, some investors with limited experience who achieved an initial victory believe they possess professional investment capabilities and begin to frequently buy and sell stocks, constantly increasing their investment amount. When systemic risks or sudden negative news about individual stocks emerge, they fail to cut their losses promptly due to overconfidence, resulting in a significant reduction in their principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-for-stable-financial-planning&#34;&gt;How to Adjust Your Mindset for Stable Financial Planning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish the Correct Investment Philosophy: Investors should clearly understand that stock investing and wealth management are aimed at achieving long-term, stable asset appreciation, not overnight riches. By learning investment knowledge, understanding market rules, adopting value investing and long-term investment philosophies, and avoiding being swayed by short-term profits and market sentiment, you can make informed decisions. For example, thoroughly research a company’s fundamentals, paying attention to its profitability, industry position, management team, and other factors, choosing stocks with long-term investment potential rather than blindly chasing short-term trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a Reasonable Investment Plan: Based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals, create a scientific and reasonable investment plan. Clearly define key elements such as the amount invested, the investment period, expected returns, and stop-loss points, and strictly execute according to the plan. This can help avoid impulsive decisions made due to emotional fluctuations during investment. For example, set the investment proportion of each stock to no more than a certain percentage of total assets, and promptly take profits when the price rises to reach the expected return, and decisively cut losses when it falls to the stop-loss point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control emotions and remain calm: When facing market volatility, you need to learn to control your own emotions, maintain calmness and rationality. You can relieve investment pressure by diverting attention, engaging in physical exercise, or communicating with others, avoiding negative impacts of emotion on investment decisions. When the market experiences a significant fluctuation, first calmly analyze the reasons, combine them with your investment strategy and stock fundamentals, and make rational judgments instead of blindly following trends or panic selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-for-steady-wealth-management&#34;&gt;How to Adjust Your Mindset for Steady Wealth Management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous Learning and Reflection: The stock market is constantly evolving, and investors need to continuously learn new investment knowledge and skills, paying attention to macroeconomic trends, industry dynamics, and company information, and constantly improving their investment level. At the same time, it’s important to regularly reflect on your investment behavior, summarize experiences and lessons learned, identify problems in your mindset and decision-making, and promptly adjust and improve them. For example, after each investment, review the entire process, analyze the reasons for success and failure, and think about how to avoid similar mistakes in future investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in stocks and wealth management is a long and challenging journey, and mindset plays a crucial role. Only by maintaining a rational, calm, humble, and independent-thinking mindset can you steadily progress through the waves of the stock market and achieve the preservation and appreciation of your wealth. ## How to Adjust Your Mindset for Steady Financial Planning&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Echoes of Time – Alternative Fantasies and Emotional Refuge</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 22:12:57 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the earliest web novel readers entered middle age, the types of “revenge” stories catered to them also evolved. The protagonists increasingly appeared as fathers, mentors, or elderly figures, reflecting the different needs and desires of middle-aged readers regarding life and emotion. These works no longer solely focused on upgrades and triumphs; instead, they emphasized emotional resonance and life lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;target-audience-shifting-reader-base-amidst-the-passage-of-time&#34;&gt;Target Audience: Shifting Reader Base Amidst the Passage of Time
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former online novel readers have largely transitioned into middle age. They’ve experienced the trials and tribulations of life, leading to shifts in their mindset and values. The passionate, adventurous elements they once chased are no longer the sole focus for them. Instead, they seek emotional resonance with their current lives and a sense of nostalgia for past years, as well as aspirations for the future. Middle-aged “comfort reads” emerged precisely because of these psychological needs. They utilize plot settings that closely align with the lifestyles and attitudes of middle-aged individuals, attracting this specific demographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;role-shift-from-young-hero-to-middle-aged-guardian&#34;&gt;Role Shift: From Young Hero to Middle-Aged Guardian
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Students Are All the Villains:&lt;/strong&gt; The protagonist, Lu Zhou, after becoming a master, faces a group of disciples with diverse personalities and formidable strength. They teeter between good and evil, and Lu Zhou must guide them towards the righteous path. This novel showcases the challenges and confusion faced by middle-aged individuals when educating the next generation through interactions with their disciples. Furthermore, the growth and transformation of the disciples offer hope and a glimpse into the future, mirroring expectations for one&amp;rsquo;s children or younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emotional-resonance-life-reflections-and-family-responsibilities&#34;&gt;Emotional Resonance: Life Reflections and Family Responsibilities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sixty-Year-Old Birthday System:&lt;/strong&gt; The protagonist gained a system upon turning sixty, embarking on a new life journey. This setting allows middle-aged readers to feel a sense of “it’s never too late” hope and inspiration. Even having reached old age, the protagonist can still realize their value and dreams through the system. This plot encourages readers to reflect on missed opportunities and unfulfilled dreams in their own lives, while also conveying an optimistic attitude, encouraging them not to give up pursuing their goals at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-design-aligning-with-the-rhythm-and-humor-of-middle-age-life&#34;&gt;Plot Design: Aligning with the Rhythm and Humor of Middle Age Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot designs for middle-aged “revenge” novels often place a greater emphasis on the details of life and the nuanced expression of emotions. Unlike young adult revenge novels that prioritize rapid upgrades and adventures, they focus more on relationships between characters and emotional entanglements. For example, in &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Master Craftsman&lt;/em&gt;, the protagonist’s friendship with his apprentice, their brotherhood with fellow disciples, and other bonds were depicted in detail. This plot design allows middle-aged readers to feel warmth and familiarity, as if seeing their own family, friendships, and love in life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spring Festival Blockbuster Movie Ticket Price Mystery: The Difference Between Online and Offline Prices</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/spring-festival-movie-tickets-price-mystery-online-vs-offline/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:02:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/spring-festival-movie-tickets-price-mystery-online-vs-offline/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the Spring Festival, a family of seven or eight people wanted to go see a movie. They originally planned to buy tickets on Taopiaopiao and Maoyan. When they looked at the price, it was 60 yuan. Luckily, they had a cinema recharge card that required them to purchase tickets at the cinema’s front desk. They thought about asking the front desk if there were any discounts, but unexpectedly, the same showtime cost only 35 yuan when purchased at the front desk. The price difference was quite surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hidden-add-on-of-platform-service-fees&#34;&gt;The “Hidden Add-on” of Platform Service Fees
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While online ticketing platforms are convenient, platform service fees cannot be ignored. They provide users with a seamless booking experience, such as precise seat selection and the ability to view purchase history at any time – all of which require investment in maintenance. These costs are then passed on to consumers through increased ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cinema-differentiation-operation-strategies&#34;&gt;Cinema Differentiation Operation Strategies
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the explosive demand for movie-watching during the Spring Festival, cinemas adopted differentiated pricing strategies to maximize revenue. Online platforms have a large volume of traffic, and many people are accustomed to purchasing tickets online in advance; therefore, cinema ticket prices were set higher on these platforms. Meanwhile, those buying tickets directly at the box office – walk-in customers – received lower prices to attract this segment of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-price-logic-behind-revenue-sharing&#34;&gt;The Price Logic Behind Revenue Sharing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue sharing models between online platforms and cinemas impact ticket prices. For an online platform to take a slice of the box office revenue – in order to maintain profitability – they will typically raise ticket prices. Meanwhile, cinema box offices have no middleman, resulting in lower costs, which naturally leads to more affordable ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consumer-ticket-buying-tips&#34;&gt;Consumer Ticket Buying Tips
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t just look at online platforms when buying tickets. Call the cinema&amp;rsquo;s front desk to inquire about prices, or go directly to the front desk and ask – you might find a surprise. If you frequently watch movies, get an auditorium membership card to enjoy member discounts and save money.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Analysis of Political Elements in 2025 Spring Festival Film Releases</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-new-year-films-2025/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:49:42 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-new-year-films-2025/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I went to the Spring Festival movie release to join in the crowds, and this time I watched two films that felt quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the new changes in the 2025 Spring Festival movie releases, focusing on &lt;em&gt;Dwelling in the Fuchun Pavilion&lt;/em&gt; (Tangrenjie Tanjian 1900) and &lt;em&gt;Nezha: The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Child&lt;/em&gt;. The former utilizes the backdrop of San Francisco’s Chinatown in 1900 to depict the discrimination and oppression faced by Chinese people, reflecting social and political conditions. As an animated film, the latter employs rich metaphorical elements to subtly critique the current international political landscape – such as the Jade Palace resembling the Pentagon mirroring the American political system, the dollar symbol on the Heavenly Mandate Throne symbolizing U.S. dollar hegemony, the jade amulet similar to American green cards representing status levels, and the Soul-Devouring Elixir like a biochemical weapon reflecting malicious actions. Both films offer a new viewing experience and prompt reflection on the relationship between cinematic art and political expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovation-in-the-style-of-chinese-new-year-film-releases&#34;&gt;Innovation in the Style of Chinese New Year Film Releases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, films released during the Spring Festival often featured lighthearted entertainment and family-friendly themes, aiming to allow audiences to relax and unwind during the holiday season, rarely addressing sensitive political topics. However, in 2025, the Spring Festival release broke with convention; &lt;em&gt;The Mystery Down South 1900&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nezha: Part One&lt;/em&gt; incorporated rich political elements, sparking widespread discussion among viewers and bringing a new atmosphere to the Spring Festival film slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shanghai-noon-1900-a-vivid-depiction-of-era-politics&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shanghai Noon 1900&amp;rdquo;: A Vivid Depiction of Era Politics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shanghai Noon 1900&amp;rdquo; is set in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown in 1900, a time when Chinese immigrants faced severe racial discrimination and oppression overseas. The protagonists not only have to solve the mystery of the case but also confront discrimination and unfair treatment from all sides of society. The film’s portrayal of racism and power struggles accurately reflects the social and political environment of that tumultuous era, allowing us to see the difficult struggle of Chinese immigrants for survival and dignity, and the underlying political issues worth deep consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such historical context inevitably reminds us of the challenges currently faced by overseas Chinese in the business sector, such as the TikTok and Zhou Zaikang incident. As of December 6, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C., rejected TikTok’s request, ruling that the congressional law passed under national security grounds requiring a forced sale stood up to constitutional scrutiny. TikTok CEO Zhou Shouheng wrote in a memo to employees that the next step would be “seeking an injunction and awaiting review by the U.S. Supreme Court.” The issue stems from the U.S.’s “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Control of Critical Technology” Act, which mandates that ByteDance must divest its TikTok business within 270 days after passage of the law, with a final deadline of January 19, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cop-next-door-1900-a-vivid-depiction-of-political-times&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Cop Next Door 1900&amp;rdquo;: A Vivid Depiction of Political Times
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to various hearings, Zhou Haosheng also faced numerous difficulties. On January 31, 2024, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on “Big Tech and the Crisis of Online Child Sexual Exploitation,” featuring well-known anti-China lawmaker Tom Cotton. Facing Zhou Haosheng, Cotton fired off eight questions regarding his nationality, including asking if he was Chinese, whether he had applied for Chinese or American citizenship, and even probing into the nationalities of his wife and children. Despite the hearing’s theme being “Online Child Sexual Exploitation,” the legislator shifted the focus to the fact that TikTok, owned by ByteDance (a Chinese company), is a Chinese-owned operation, forcing Zhou Haosheng to answer irrelevant questions. “Just as in &lt;em&gt;The Mystery of Chinatown 1900&lt;/em&gt;, Chinese people abroad faced unwarranted discrimination, Zhou Shengyi also encountered unfair treatment and scrutiny in the business sector due to his background with TikTok. This series of events reflects how overseas Chinese have consistently faced formidable obstacles when pursuing their own development and safeguarding their rights across different eras – whether it’s racial prejudice a century ago or today&amp;rsquo;s political manipulation in commerce – warrants deep reflection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-deer-and-the-phoenix-born-to-be-wild-political-metaphor-behind-the-myth-unveiled&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Deer and the Phoenix: Born to Be Wild&amp;rdquo;: Political Metaphor Behind the Myth Unveiled
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Deer and the Phoenix: Born to Be Wild&amp;rdquo; appears to be a typical animated film, but many of its settings and plots are laden with political metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping of Power Systems&lt;/strong&gt;: The Yuhuang Palace is shaped like the center of supreme power in the celestial realm, with architectural styles similar to the U.S. Pentagon, primarily using white tones symbolizing Western hegemony disguised under the banner of “universal values.” The &amp;ldquo;Monster Hunting Team&amp;rdquo; led by Wuliang Xianzun, with its subordinates Lu Ban and He Feifei, are believed to correspond to the US alliance system of Japan and Korea. The Yuhuang Palace’s “online meeting” scene, where twelve golden immortals gather to discuss the “Battle of Sovereigns,” is like the NATO meetings dominated by the United States, suppressing other countries under the guise of &amp;ldquo;maintaining order.&amp;rdquo; - &lt;strong&gt;Subtext of Economic Hegemony&lt;/strong&gt;: The Yu Huh Palace’s celestial tripod used for alchemy, with dollar signs at the entrance, symbolizes America “refining” other nations&amp;rsquo; resources through economic hegemony.  The Great Immortals Wu Ling Wen used the guise of “upholding heaven and earth” to cast the dragons into the cauldron for refinement, much like some countries exploit “international rules” for their own benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metaphor of Identity and Hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt;: The fairy identity amulet obtained by Nezha, with its color and pattern design resembling an American green card, symbolizes the immortals’ rejection and hierarchical division of “foreign races,” hinting at the differences in identity and unequal treatment between different countries and groups in reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Allusions to Malicious Actions&lt;/strong&gt;: Great Immortals Wu Ling Wen forced Nezha to take the Soul-Destroying Pill, which resembled a bioweapon, darkly implying that some nations use the guise of “saving the world” to carry out destructive and ruinous actions against other countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-deer-and-the-phoenix-born-to-be-wild-a-political-allegory-hidden-behind-mythology--an-analysis&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Deer and the Phoenix: Born to Be Wild&amp;rdquo;: A Political Allegory Hidden Behind Mythology – An Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbol of Resources and Development:&lt;/strong&gt; The Seven Colored Lotus, as a key to reshaping Niuwa and Ao Bing’s bodies, symbolizes monopolized energy and technological lifelines dominated by major powers. Its “瓊漿玉液” (琼浆玉液 - Jīngjiāng Yùyuè – literally &amp;ldquo;jade elixir and pearl liquid&amp;rdquo;) requires obtaining through the Yu Huang Palace&amp;rsquo;s “成仙考試” (chéngxiān kǎoshì – “Celestial Transformation Examination”), reflecting developing countries’ reliance on core resources and suffering from “rule-based plunder” within a hegemonic system. The Lotus’ temporary failure and restoration conditions metaphorically represent the survival dilemmas of small nations in an era of energy crises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deep-reflections-on-cinematic-art-and-political-expression&#34;&gt;Deep Reflections on Cinematic Art and Political Expression
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two films, amidst the nationwide viewing craze during the Spring Festival, incorporated political elements, offering audiences a new cinematic experience – one that moved beyond simple entertainment and served as a mirror reflecting political issues within history and reality. This has prompted us to delve into the relationship between cinematic art and political expression. Will directors in future film creations increasingly convey their perspectives on social and political matters through cinema? As a powerful cultural transmission medium, can film simultaneously engage in artistic expression while also taking greater responsibility for observing and contemplating societal realities? These questions are worth exploring as we appreciate films, and we look forward to the film industry bringing more exciting integration of art and real-world expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-egg&#34;&gt;Easter Egg
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boabab large model, wasn&amp;rsquo;t performing very well today, froze several times, the article stopped halfway and couldn’t continue, so I had to restart the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The two major political parties in the United States – the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:40:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Party and the Republican Party exhibit significant differences in political ideology, policy proposals, and social values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;political-ideologies-and-policy-positions&#34;&gt;Political Ideologies and Policy Positions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/strong&gt;: Leans towards liberal/left-wing, advocating for the government to play an active role in economic and social affairs, supporting social welfare, environmental protection, and multiculturalism. In tax policy, the Democratic Party supports tax cuts for low- and middle-income individuals while raising rates for high earners and corporations. On social issues, the Democratic Party supports abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and advocates for strict gun control. In foreign policy, the Democratic Party emphasizes multilateralism and diplomatic means, preferring to address global problems through international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Republican Party&lt;/strong&gt;: Leans towards conservative, advocating for limited government intervention, emphasizing individual liberty and a free market economy. In tax policy, the Republican Party supports tax cuts, believing they should benefit everyone regardless of income level. On social issues, the Republican Party opposes abortion and same-sex marriage, supports the right to bear arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-significance-of-trumps-ascendancy&#34;&gt;The Significance of Trump&amp;rsquo;s Ascendancy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump was re-elected as President of the United States in 2024, marking a reaffirmation of the Republican Party’s dominance within American politics. Trump’s policy stances included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump advocated for stimulating economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation, particularly supporting the development of traditional manufacturing and energy industries. He also leaned towards protectionist trade policies, renegotiating or withdrawing from existing trade agreements to protect America&amp;rsquo;s economic interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immigration Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump planned to strengthen border security, restrict illegal immigration, and implement stricter scrutiny and limitations on legal immigrants. He also supported limiting refugees and asylum seekers to maintain national security. - &lt;strong&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/strong&gt;: Trump favored a unilateral approach, emphasizing “America First,” reducing reliance on international organizations, reevaluating relationships with allies, and employing tougher diplomatic measures when necessary. He also planned to expand fossil fuel production and usage and loosen restrictions on environmental protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s potential second term could lead to significant adjustments in U.S. domestic policy and have profound impacts on global politics and economics. His policies were likely to draw attention and reaction from the international community, particularly in areas such as trade, environment, and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ollama-local-deployment-deepseek-r1/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:41:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ollama-local-deployment-deepseek-r1/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ollama is an open-source AI tool designed to enable users to run and deploy large language models (LLMs) locally. Its goal is to provide a convenient and efficient way for developers to use models like GPT on their local machines without relying on cloud services. Ollama supports multiple models and focuses on optimizing performance, allowing even resource-constrained devices to smoothly run these models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Ollama, users can utilize text-based AI applications and interact with locally deployed models without concerns about data privacy or high API usage fees. You can invoke different models via a command-line interface (CLI) for tasks such as natural language processing and question answering. &amp;gt; ollama is suitable for trying out different models, and after testing the Windows version, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t fully leverage the hardware’s performance – this may be due to the Windows version. When deploying 32b parameter models with low memory and GPU load, the response speed is very slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hardware-overview&#34;&gt;Hardware Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating System: Windows 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU: i7-10700K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory: 40GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics Card: RTX 3060 12GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;environment-setup&#34;&gt;Environment Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the following system environment variables for easier use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_MODELS=E:\ollama&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
This variable specifies the location where Ollama models are stored. &lt;code&gt;E:\ollama&lt;/code&gt; is a folder path indicating that all local model files will be stored in this directory. Ollama will load and use the language models you download or deploy based on this path. You can store your model files in another location by simply changing this path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:8000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
This environment variable sets the host and port for the Ollama service.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; is the localhost address, meaning the Ollama service will only listen for requests from the local machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;8000&lt;/code&gt; is the specified port number, indicating that the Ollama service will wait for and process requests on port 8000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;environment-setup-1&#34;&gt;Environment Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
This environment variable controls which origins are allowed to access the Ollama service.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; indicates that any origin (i.e., all domains and IP addresses) can access the Ollama service. This is typically used in development and debugging environments, where production environments usually specify stricter origin control, limiting only specific domains or IPs to access your service to improve security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deepseek-r1-model-deployment&#34;&gt;deepseek-R1 Model Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ollama installation is straightforward, so we won&amp;rsquo;t detail it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-installation verification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploy the model, referring to the official model page and selecting the appropriate parameter version: &lt;code&gt;ollama run deepseek-r1:14b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 14b parameter version effectively remembers conversation context; smaller parameter versions cannot retain context. The 32b parameter version is very sluggish when deployed locally and hasn&amp;rsquo;t been further tested.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PowerShell 7 and Persistent Settings Command-Line Prediction View</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/powershell-7-persisting-settings-command-line-prediction-view/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:19:12 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/powershell-7-persisting-settings-command-line-prediction-view/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“I’d gotten used to using zsh on Linux, and when I was writing a blog post the other day, I suddenly realized that PowerShell 7 also supports persistent command-line prediction views, so I tried it out. It turned out to be pretty useful after all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I did to enable this feature, but it just appeared—that’s all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
e&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;powershell-7-a-powerful-tool-across-platforms&#34;&gt;PowerShell 7: A Powerful Tool Across Platforms
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;cross-platform-features&#34;&gt;Cross-Platform Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 breaks down platform limitations, allowing you to perform enterprise-level server management on Windows systems, system administration in Linux environments, or daily development tasks on macOS – all with a unified PowerShell 7 tool. This significantly increases productivity and reduces the learning curve and operational complexity associated with platform differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;powerful-features&#34;&gt;Powerful Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It possesses powerful scripting capabilities, supporting object-oriented programming, functions, modules, and other advanced programming features. Through PowerShell 7, users can easily operate the file system, create, delete, copy, move, and perform other operations on files and folders; it can access and modify the registry to deeply adjust system configurations; it can manage processes and services to effectively monitor and control the system&amp;rsquo;s running status. Furthermore, PowerShell 7 can interact with various Windows and non-Windows technologies, such as user and permission management in Active Directory and resource allocation and management on the Azure cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-source-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Open Source Ecosystem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 is open source, a feature that allows developers and enthusiasts worldwide to actively participate in its development and improvement. A large number of open-source modules and tools are constantly emerging, enriching the functionality and application scenarios of PowerShell 7. Users can find suitable modules within the open-source community to extend the capabilities of PowerShell 7 or contribute their own code to drive the development of the entire community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compatibility-and-stability&#34;&gt;Compatibility and Stability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 maintains compatibility with older versions of PowerShell while introducing many new features and improvements. These enhancements not only improve performance but also increase stability, allowing users to complete various tasks more smoothly and reducing disruptions caused by software failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enable-command-line-prediction-view&#34;&gt;Enable Command-Line Prediction View
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the many useful features of PowerShell 7, the &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt; command is a practical tool that enhances the user&amp;rsquo;s command-line input experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the command itself isn’t necessary to achieve auto-completion, it only provides in-line completion; once enabled, it allows for prediction view, displaying all possible completion options in a list format. Users can then select the desired option using the up and down arrow keys, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of command input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/powershell-7-persisting-settings-commandline-prediction-view/20250207222546.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;methods-to-make-commands-persistent&#34;&gt;Methods to Make Commands Persistent
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt; command takes effect every time PowerShell starts, we can add it to PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s profile. A PowerShell profile is a special script that automatically executes its commands when PowerShell launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;determine-configuration-file-path&#34;&gt;Determine Configuration File Path
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In PowerShell, we can use the &lt;code&gt;$PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; variable to view the path of the configuration file. If the file does not exist under that path, the user can manually create it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-configuration-file&#34;&gt;Open Configuration File
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a text editor, such as the powerful Notepad++ or the lightweight Visual Studio Code, to open the file corresponding to the configuration file path obtained through the &lt;code&gt;$PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-command&#34;&gt;Add Command
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the opened configuration file, add the command &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt;. Ensure that the command is written accurately to guarantee that the configuration file takes effect correctly when executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;save-configuration&#34;&gt;Save Configuration
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adding the command, save the configuration file and close the text editor. At this point, the configuration file contains the commands we want to execute every time PowerShell starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;verification-settings&#34;&gt;Verification Settings
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the current PowerShell window and restart PowerShell. In the newly launched PowerShell, when entering commands, the command-line input prediction view style should already be displayed in list view according to our settings, indicating that our settings have been successfully applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these steps, we not only gained a deeper understanding of the powerful features and characteristics of PowerShell 7 but also learned how to use the command-line input prediction view style to enhance the user experience, and how to make these settings persistent. We hope this knowledge can help you operate PowerShell 7 more confidently and efficiently complete various system management and automation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DeepSeek suddenly went viral before the Spring Festival, NVIDIA stock plummeted: The behind institutional operations and the chain of thought for large models.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-drop-institutional-operations-large-language-model-chain/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:36:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-drop-institutional-operations-large-language-model-chain/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Spring Festival, DeepSeek had become a hot topic, attracting widespread attention on social media in just a few days. This sudden surge in popularity was astonishing and triggered a chain reaction in the market. Meanwhile, NVIDIA’s stock price plummeted, raising concerns among many investors, with some institutions conducting large-scale short selling during this period, seemingly pointing to a “carefully orchestrated” situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deepseeks-sudden-surge-in-popularity-rapidly-becoming-a-focus&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s Sudden Surge in Popularity: Rapidly Becoming a Focus&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is an AI-powered tool focused on optimizing deep learning models, particularly in the applications of natural language processing (NLP) and image generation. In the days leading up to Chinese New Year, this project suddenly garnered significant attention from investors and tech professionals alike. The performance of its team and the demonstrated technical results sparked strong interest among many. Discussions about DeepSeek dominated all topics within the developer community and on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, DeepSeek’s sudden surge in popularity was not accidental. After analysis, many began to suspect that certain entities may have been involved behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nvidia-stock-plummets-the-hand-behind-the-short-selling-operation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia Stock Plummets: The Hand Behind the Short Selling Operation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), has long been a key hardware provider for many large models and AI computations. With the rapid development of the AI market, Nvidia’s stock has performed strongly over the long term and even become a favorite among many investors. However, with the explosive popularity of DeepSeek and the market&amp;rsquo;s intense focus on its technology, Nvidia’s stock experienced a dramatic plunge.
The underlying cause of this phenomenon may involve institutional investor short selling strategies. Over the past few years, as AI technology has proliferated, Nvidia’s stock price has been significantly inflated, leading many investors to believe that it carries risks of excessive speculation. Particularly after a technology like DeepSeek went viral, some institutions may have profited substantially by shorting Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chain-of-thought-reasoning-with-large-models-from-results-to-process&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Large Models: From “Results” to “Process”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In traditional artificial intelligence applications, many practitioners and investors have focused more on the “results” of AI models – such as generated images or text – rather than the underlying reasoning process. In discussions related to DeepSeek, an increasing number of people are beginning to realize that the chain-of-thought hidden behind large models is the core content worth paying attention to. Previously, we could only see the model’s output results, but now we need to understand the logic, algorithms, and how to optimize the model&amp;rsquo;s performance by adjusting these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in thinking represents a deep reflection on AI research and application. From simple black-box operations to a genuine shift towards understanding the internal workings of models, leading many technologists and investors to re-evaluate the future direction of artificial intelligence. The popularity of DeepSeek perfectly represents a breakthrough in this thought chain; it prompted people to focus on the entire model construction and optimization process, rather than just the final output results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sudden surge in popularity of DeepSeek, NVIDIA’s stock plummet, and the subsequent short-selling activities by institutions – it all seems like a meticulously designed scheme. Through an in-depth understanding of large model chain-of-thought reasoning, we can see that the application of AI technology is not merely superficial layering of phenomena, but also deep digging and optimization of the model’s internal logic. As the technology progresses, we may likely see more innovative tools like DeepSeek in the future, driving AI research and applications to a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon not only shows us the immense potential of AI technology, but also prompts us to start thinking about the commercial games and capital operations behind the technology. The future market trajectory will continue to be a focus of the ongoing battle between technology and capital.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Modern Monetary Theory the future of global economies?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/modern-monetary-theory-future-global-economy/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 23:16:34 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/modern-monetary-theory-future-global-economy/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. stock market’s sustained bull run is largely driven by dollar liquidity rather than America&amp;rsquo;s inherent “hard power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the 2008 financial crisis, the modern monetary system has gradually become an important theoretical cornerstone for many global economies, primarily emphasizing the subjective agency of large governments in intervening in markets. It utilizes government fiscal deficits as its main tool to achieve full employment while stabilizing inflation. &amp;ndash;more&amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the public is more familiar with regarding large government is &lt;strong&gt;Keynesianism&lt;/strong&gt;, which emphasizes the government’s role in smoothing out cyclical fluctuations – for example, suppressing overheating and stimulating contraction when it’s slowing down. It places a strong emphasis on the multiplier effect of government spending, namely how one unit of monetary stimulus can increase consumer multiplier expansion by a certain amount. When government expenditure 1 opens money, businesses and individuals increase income by 1 unit, businesses expand production and employment, and individuals expand consumption to resist economic contraction. Simultaneously, it is relatively conservative regarding fiscal deficit limits and sustainability. The &lt;strong&gt;multiplier effect&lt;/strong&gt; will drive market recovery, thereby increasing the government’s revenue, especially during the suppression of overheated cycles, which can accumulate funds for stimulating the next cycle, such as the potential debt burden and interest rate levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern monetary systems are essentially an extension of extreme Keynesianism, but with key differences. The biggest characteristic is the limitation on government debt. Central banks should not have independent autonomy; their primary objectives should be &lt;strong&gt;inflation and full employment&lt;/strong&gt;. Given that inflation is constrained by limited productive resources and technological advancements – meaning the government continuously increases purchasing power into the market through unlimited fiscal deficits as production efficiency rises with technology, ultimately reaching an ideal point of full employment and a production bottleneck – further monetary expansion would trigger inflation. At this point, they choose to cap fiscal deficits, provided there are still idle productive assets available; increasing deficits will not cause inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-financial-crisis&#34;&gt;After the Financial Crisis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, reality is far from an ideal world; execution in each stage involves human participation, and Keynesianism is selectively applied. This leads to more economic stimulus than effective suppression, with economic overheating being used for political gains while suppressing excessive growth is lacking. It’s fundamentally difficult to restrain these issues, resulting in numerous economic problems, and even new financial crises that are no less severe than the economic shocks caused by traditional overcapacity. - The 2008 global financial crisis was, in essence, a market self-reinforcement bubble driven by extreme Keynesianism. It resulted in the proliferation of “odd-shaped” structured financial products – such as real estate and financial investments derived from it – and, crucially, a lack of risk awareness across academia, government, and markets. Debt-fueled prosperity was viewed as an achievement, and many profited from it, including massive financial systems that declared losses were the responsibility of others while announcing profits for themselves. The infamous phrase “you don’t get your money back until it’s gone” ultimately led to widespread investment and the assumption of risk by those who had benefited from earlier stages, culminating in a catastrophic outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-financial-crisis-1&#34;&gt;After the Financial Crisis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was after the financial crisis that the shadow of the modern monetary system entered, characterized by rapid &lt;strong&gt;monetization of fiscal deficits and central banks’ unlimited quantitative easing&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as so-called emergency central bank lending policies. The central bank acted as the ultimate lender, supplying an endless supply of bullets, allowing governments to continue incurring debt, and coordinating with fiscal policy. The central bank supported government fiscal deficit spending through purchases of bonds, ensuring consistency of policy objectives. This is also why the boundaries between modern monetary and fiscal policies are becoming increasingly blurred – relying heavily on the central bank’s direct participation in purchasing sovereign debt, a “printing money while buying bonds” approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eurozone and the United States exhibited similar trends; in 2008, the government debt of the European Union was approximately €6. - 7 trillion euros, with a government leverage ratio of approximately 66%, slightly above the generally recognized warning line of 60%. As of 2014 – that is, during the 5-year period of the bailout – the debt scale reached 9.5 trillion euros, and the leverage rose to 93%. The United States was even more exaggerated; in 2008, U.S. government debt was approximately $10 trillion, which by 2014 had risen to around $18 trillion, and recently it again raised its government debt ceiling. Of course, each drama always used the threat of a government shutdown as a gimmick, but each time it broke through the government debt limit. Currently exceeding $36 trillion, compared to $26 trillion growth since the 2008 financial crisis. Considering the GDP growth factor, the government leverage has grown from 60% to over 120%. The Federal Reserve, as the ultimate lender, played an important role in multiple rescue operations and is one of the main buyers of government debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flaws-and-limitations-of-the-modern-monetary-system&#34;&gt;Flaws and Limitations of the Modern Monetary System
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This government-led stimulus scheme, though not a planned economy, faces consistent problems. How can you guarantee the market’s omniscience and all participants’ selfless dedication at every stage? Let&amp;rsquo;s take a simple example: if a government department increases its budget for a particular direction by 1 million, is it going to go to the mayor’s nephew or a more cost-effective market bidding process? Of course, in reality, interests will form in increasingly complex ways, leading to the result that even though the government expands debt and spending, it flows completely out of control. The recent American establishment of an Office of Efficiency is an extension of this type of problem. These issues manifest differently across varying corrupt economies; we’re focusing on discussing the more prevalent problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-inflation-issues&#34;&gt;1. Inflation Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the development of the modern information network, governments have a much greater grasp on market information than in the past. However, this isn’t omniscience – markets inherently contain variables and are constantly subject to change based on expectations, entering a recursive loop (“the ouroboros”). I anticipate your predictions. Taking actual performance as an example, despite the relatively successful implementation of Modern Monetary Theory between 2008 and 2020—achieving short-term economic recovery and inflation stabilization, with even the Eurozone experiencing phase deflation and US inflation largely remaining within the expected 1-3% range—this led people to believe in increasingly extreme tools, much like they once believed in Keynesianism. Looking back, this was primarily due to the continued high growth trend of manufacturing in developing countries after 2008. For example, China, which gradually established itself as a global production powerhouse during this period, along with other emerging economies like Southeast Asia and India, maintained relatively high levels of industrial value added. This effectively offset the largest constraint within the Modern Monetary Theory – resource supply limitations – allowing both Europe and the United States to sustain comparatively stable inflation even amidst de-industrialization and excessive financialization, alongside increased government debt and a surge in monetary supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-inflation-issues-1&#34;&gt;1. Inflation Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after 2020, with the use of larger-scale stimulus policies, both the Eurozone and the United States experienced relatively significant inflation, peaking at around 10%, even today, despite interest rate hikes lasting nearly three years, the U.S. labor market continues to show an abnormal overheating, and financial markets have seen a divergence from economic growth supported by monetary support, with inflation running towards 3% as the base effect disappears. This overheating phenomenon during interest rate hikes is closely related to fiscal deficits. Interest rate hikes are a contractionary monetary policy, while fiscal policy remains expansionary, compounded by the ultra-massive monetary injection of 2020, which has made U.S. inflation remarkably persistent. The biggest limitation of Modern Monetary Theory is high inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-government-debt-issues&#34;&gt;2. Government Debt Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In principle, governments can indefinitely finance debt repayment through borrowing, provided that the central bank becomes a complete puppet – meaning full alignment of monetary and fiscal policy objectives within a modern monetary system. However, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to fully cede control to the government, given the accumulated government debt balance over many years, particularly interest expenses, which are increasingly becoming a significant burden on finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal Year 2023: In fiscal year 2023, U.S. revenue totaled $4.439 trillion, with interest expense on the debt accounting for approximately 15% of that revenue.  In 2024, this high-interest environment continued, according to data released by the U.S. Treasury Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal Year 2024: The U.S. federal government’s budget deficit reached $1.833 trillion, with net interest payments totaling $882 billion – approximately 18% of U.S. federal revenue, even exceeding Social Security expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-government-debt-issues-1&#34;&gt;2. Government Debt Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the issue of fiscal sustainability. If low interest rates and low inflation, combined with high debt (such as Japan’s), are maintained over the long term, it can indeed form an application of modern monetary theory in this way. According to the 72 rule, as long as interest rates are sufficiently low, incremental debt financing will be very slow. If the cost of capital is 1%, debt-funded growth can reach twice the debt level in 72 years. Assuming inflation breaks this delicate balance, interest payments on debt accumulate, leading to compound interest and causing future debt trajectories to spiral out of control. Principal becomes a secondary factor. If the central bank then deviates from the goals of the ruling party, these issues will become even more acute. “The Trump administration’s policy stances sharply contrasted with the Fed’s hawkish stance at the time, which was also a key factor in the escalation of relations between the government and the Fed during his term. The focus for most observers is likely whether the current chairman can successfully complete his term.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-financial-bubbles-and-monetary-credit-issues&#34;&gt;3. Financial Bubbles and Monetary Credit Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the government’s expanded spending enters both households and businesses, leading to increased expenditure and a boost in effective demand. However, given that people are all experienced participants in numerous financial bubbles since 2000, individuals tend to exhibit a significant investment appreciation bias in their choices between investing and consuming, particularly when one or more products with extremely high expected returns appear. People will flock to the financial markets seeking higher gains, even willing to compress living standards and take on additional leverage. This is similar to what occurred during periods of high real estate growth in Japan, the United States, and China. Combining policy stimulus with the pursuit of maximum self-interest by practitioners, issues such as subprime loans are prevalent. Many so-called “rescue” policies actually encourage borrowing. Therefore, history has shown a remarkable consistency: when large-scale monetary and fiscal policies are deployed, it often results in &lt;strong&gt;a frenzy of asset bubbles and wealth redistribution&lt;/strong&gt;. Asset bubbles occur first, followed by wealth redistribution, which leads to another problem – extreme Keynesianism or Modern Monetary Theory’s persistent tendency towards economic Ponzi schemes (Minsky Moment). As long as there is hot money, asset prices continue to rise. As long as they continue to rise, it attracts later entrants holding cash, while the CPI, measuring changes in basic living expenses, doesn&amp;rsquo;t change significantly. Money circulates within specific sectors and becomes worthless for later entrants. &lt;strong&gt;After the frenzy comes the collapse&lt;/strong&gt;, which is Minsky Moment’s relentless vindication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial Bubbles and Monetary Credit Issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, money itself has a supply and demand relationship. When the market supply is excessive, and traditional investment assets cannot accommodate it, or when it has been harvested too many times and cannot attract investment, such as repeatedly collapsing real estate bubbles (Japanese people haven&amp;rsquo;t dared to touch real estate investments for decades), tax policies that increase property holding taxes to reduce speculative demand, will increase the cost of financial speculation. In a situation of excessive monetary supply, the market urgently needs investment assets that are &lt;strong&gt;tax-free&lt;/strong&gt;, and various virtual investment products have emerged. Even U.S. President and First Lady have come in to share a cup, one saying is to dig into the dollar wall, but in fact it&amp;rsquo;s the inevitable result of currency abuse and financial emptiness under global monetary issuance and currency credit damage, challenging the modern monetary theory’s reliance on national monopoly rights-based credit money status, even facing challenges. What kind of soil breeds what kind of financial games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Bubbles and Monetary Credit Issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, modern monetary theory and Keynesianism are more like progressive and substitutional relationships, placing a greater emphasis on government intervention in markets and adopting a more radical attitude towards fiscal deficits and the independence of central banks. Excessive use of Keynesianism led to stagflation and financial crises. Following this artificial economic overheating, modern monetary theory quietly took over after 2008. Under globalization, continued productivity gains allowed for rapid growth recovery and maintained inflation levels in using countries, but it also accumulated massive government debt and financial bubbles. When inflation rebounded, with inconsistent goals between central banks and governments, high interest rates and high leverage coexisted, significantly increasing the fiscal burden of government monetization. Fiscal sustainability was drastically reduced, and due to excessive government participation, base monetary injections led to financial bubbles. Unending money printing weakened the currency itself, appearing strong but merely a reflection of others. This also created fertile ground for various new types of speculative financial investment tools, even escaping traditional financial investment tax restrictions. This is a microcosm of the global economy. Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) may not be the future, but rather a past tense used from 2008 onwards, layered with reverse economic globalization. The more financial bubbles were inflated, the higher government debt accumulated, the more frantic the financial speculation tools became, and the greater the efficiency in achieving distorted wealth distribution – the greater the risk of a hard landing, including economic and social risks. Whether Keynesianism or MMT, no matter how much monetary supply is increased, it cannot truly solve the wealth structure problem; instead, it exacerbates risks within asset bubbles and financialization. People are constantly falling into the same pit in different postures repeatedly, but they never learn anything from it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mastering atop: A Comprehensive Guide to Monitoring Linux System Metrics – Installation, Configuration, and Usage</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/using-atop-to-monitor-linux-system-metrics-installation-configuration-and-usage-guide/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 22:48:55 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/using-atop-to-monitor-linux-system-metrics-installation-configuration-and-usage-guide/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Linux system administration, real-time and comprehensive monitoring of system resources and process status is crucial. The atop tool, as a powerful monitoring utility, helps us easily achieve this goal. This article will provide a detailed introduction on how to install, configure, and use the atop monitoring tool in a Linux instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-atop-tool-introduction&#34;&gt;I. atop Tool Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;atop is a tool specifically designed for monitoring Linux system resources and processes. It records the activity of systems and processes, and reports on the running status of all processes. The data collected by this tool covers resource usage such as CPU, memory, disk, and network, as well as process states. It can also save the data in log files to disk. For each process, we can obtain key information such as CPU utilization, memory growth, disk usage, priority, username, status, and exit code. Furthermore, through the atop configuration file, we can customize parameters such as logging collection frequency, log file storage path, and rotation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-installing-the-atop-tool&#34;&gt;II. Installing the atop Tool
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The installation method for atop varies slightly depending on the Linux distribution. The following provides an introduction based on common operating systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba Cloud Linux 3/2, CentOS 7/8, Fedora, Rocky Linux 9:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the installation command: &lt;code&gt;sudo yum install -y atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the atop service: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu / Debian:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the software source list: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the installation command: &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install -y atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the atop service: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CentOS Stream 9:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install: &lt;code&gt;sudo wget https://www.atoptool.nl/download/atop-2.11.0-1.el9.x86_64.rpm &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo rpm -i atop-2.11.0-1.el9.x86_64.rpm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the atop service: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl start atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-installing-the-atop-tool-1&#34;&gt;II. Installing the atop Tool
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;openSUSE&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the installation command: &lt;code&gt;sudo zypper install -y atop atop-daemon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-configuring-monitoring-cycle-and-log-retention-time&#34;&gt;III. Configuring Monitoring Cycle and Log Retention Time
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration File Location:&lt;/strong&gt; In Alibaba Cloud Linux 3/2, CentOS 7/8, and Fedora systems, the atop configuration file is &lt;code&gt;/etc/sysconfig/atop&lt;/code&gt;; in Ubuntu, Debian, and openSUSE systems, the configuration file is &lt;code&gt;/etc/default/atop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Default Configuration Parameter Explanation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOGOPTS&lt;/code&gt;: Controls logging options for log files, defaults to empty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOGINTERVAL&lt;/code&gt;: Monitoring cycle, default is 600 seconds. To collect historical logs for tracking issues, it’s recommended to adjust this frequency based on actual needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOGGENERATIONS&lt;/code&gt;: Log retention time, default is 28 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LOGPATH&lt;/code&gt;: Log file storage path, defaults to &lt;code&gt;/var/log/atop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-configure-monitoring-cycle-and-log-retention-time&#34;&gt;III. Configure Monitoring Cycle and Log Retention Time
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration Steps&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute the command to open the configuration file:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Alibaba Cloud Linux 3/2, CentOS 7/8, Fedora systems: &lt;code&gt;sudo vim /etc/sysconfig/atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, CentOS Stream 9, Rocky Linux 9 systems: &lt;code&gt;sudo vim /etc/default/atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press ‘i’ to enter edit mode and adjust the configuration parameters according to your needs. For example, change the monitoring cycle to 30 seconds, set the log retention time to 7 days, and maintain the default log path:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press ‘Esc’ to return to normal editing mode, type &lt;code&gt;:wq&lt;/code&gt; to save and exit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart the atop service to apply the configuration: &lt;code&gt;sudo systemctl restart atop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Understanding “buy rate” and “sell rate” in exchange rates</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-exchange-rates-buy-and-sell-rates/</link>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-exchange-rates-buy-and-sell-rates/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the foreign exchange market, particularly at banks or currency exchange points, we often see terms like “buy rate” and “sell rate.” Many people may not be clear about these concepts, or even confuse them. Today, let’s help everyone understand the meaning of these rates and their functions through a simple example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-what-are-buy-rate-and-sell-rate&#34;&gt;1. What are “Buy Rate” and “Sell Rate”?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The bank or currency exchange institution is willing to purchase foreign currencies at this rate, meaning when you sell your foreign currency (such as US dollars) to the bank, the bank will pay you RMB according to the buy rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The bank or currency exchange institution is willing to sell foreign currencies at this rate, meaning when you buy foreign currency with RMB, the bank will sell you the foreign currency at the sell rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The price at which the bank buys foreign currency from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The price at which the bank sells foreign currency to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the buy and sell rates of banks are usually different, and the sell rate is generally higher than the buy rate. This difference is the source of profit for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-specific-case-analysis&#34;&gt;2. Specific Case Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help everyone better understand the practical application of these exchange rates, let’s look at a specific example:
Assume you go to a bank to exchange dollars, and the bank provides the following exchange rate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 US Dollar = 7.0 RMB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 US Dollar = 7.2 RMB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-1-you-sell-us-dollars-to-a-bank&#34;&gt;Scenario 1: You Sell US Dollars to a Bank
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assume you have $1000 and want to sell it to a bank. The bank will calculate the transaction using the buying rate:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
$1000 \times 7.0 \, \text{Renminbi/USD} = 7000 \, \text{Renminbi}
\]
&lt;p&gt;This means the bank will give you 7000 RMB. The exchange rate is the &lt;strong&gt;buying rate&lt;/strong&gt; because you are selling US dollars to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-two-you-buy-us-dollars-with-renminbi&#34;&gt;Scenario Two: You Buy US Dollars with Renminbi
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assume you have 7,000 RMB and want to exchange it for US dollars. The bank will calculate the amount in USD based on the selling rate:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
7000 \, \text{RMB} \div 7.2 \, \text{RMB/USD} = 972.22 \, \text{USD}
\]
&lt;p&gt;In this case, you can exchange 7,000 RMB for approximately 972.22 USD. The exchange rate here is the &lt;strong&gt;selling rate&lt;/strong&gt;, because you are purchasing USD from the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-why-buying-and-selling-currency-differ&#34;&gt;3. Why Buying and Selling Currency Differ?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that a bank’s buying rate (7.0 RMB/USD) is lower than its selling rate (7.2 RMB/USD). This is because banks typically profit from this exchange rate spread when engaging in foreign exchange transactions. In other words, banks earn profits by charging a higher selling rate and paying a lower buying rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the above case, the bank’s spread is:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
\text{Selling Rate} (7.2) - \text{Buying Rate} (7.0) = 0.2 \, RMB
\]
&lt;p&gt;This difference in price is the source of the bank&amp;rsquo;s profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-summary&#34;&gt;4. Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The bank buys foreign currency from you at this rate (the same rate you sold the foreign currency for).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selling Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The bank sells foreign currency to you at this rate (the same rate you bought the foreign currency for).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exchange Rate Difference:&lt;/strong&gt; The difference between the buying and selling rates is the bank’s profit margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these two rate concepts allows us to clearly know how much foreign currency we will receive, or how much Renminbi we need to spend to buy foreign currency when conducting foreign exchange transactions. We hope this simple example helps everyone better understand the basic principles of foreign exchange rates!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visual Studio loading a mismatched PDB file</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-loading-unmatched-pdb-files/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 20:04:33 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-loading-unmatched-pdb-files/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When debugging programs under Windows using Visual Studio, if the PDB file does not match the executable file, Visual Studio will display &amp;ldquo;Unable to load symbol file.&amp;rdquo; The program crashes and generates a crash dump. If it&amp;rsquo;s an mismatched PDB file, Visual Studio cannot smoothly enter the crash site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-pdb-file&#34;&gt;What is a PDB File?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PDB file is a debugging information file created by Microsoft, used for debugging programs. It contains information such as the symbol table, source code filenames, line numbers, and other debugging data. A PDB file can be generated during program compilation to aid in debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;windbg-debugging&#34;&gt;WinDbg Debugging
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WinDbg is a debugging tool from Microsoft that can be used to debug Windows programs. WinDbg can load mismatched PDB files, but this requires manual loading. The &lt;code&gt;.reload /f /i&lt;/code&gt; command forces the loading of mismatched PDB files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, WinDbg is less convenient to use than Visual Studio, so we want Visual Studio to also be able to load mismatched PDB files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio-cannot-load-matching-pdb-files&#34;&gt;Visual Studio Cannot Load Matching PDB Files
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source code is now generally managed through Git, allowing you to find the corresponding version of the code and recompile it to generate a matching PDB file. Why can&amp;rsquo;t it load? The main reason is that metadata doesn’t match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a small tool that can modify metadata based on EXE file information to generate a new PDB file, enabling Visual Studio to load it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chkmatch Download Address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.debuginfo.com/tools/chkmatch.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-chkmatch&#34;&gt;Using chkmatch
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, perform the check operation to analyze the cause of mismatches and prompt an error indicating signature mismatch.
Then, execute the modify operation to ensure that the pdb file matches the executable file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

        <title>Cursor AI Programming IDE Trial</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cursor-ai-programming-ide-trial/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 19:30:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cursor-ai-programming-ide-trial/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like another year has passed, and the biggest change at work is a significantly increased involvement of AI. Previously, switching between different development languages required developers to be familiar with various language-specific API interfaces. Now, these basic code snippets can all be generated by AI, which is a huge blessing for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chatgpt&#34;&gt;ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As early as 2023, I’ve written two simple introductory articles about it. Now it&amp;rsquo;s been 25 years – how to put this… I haven’t felt a significant improvement. It still needs to develop its own cognition, be able to reasonably break down tasks, and, of course, most importantly, identify whether AI-generated code contains bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-copilot&#34;&gt;Github Copilot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a long time ago, but I saw some information saying that Singapore deployed the server and it’s available for use in China. No longer need to maintain a VPN for extended periods. Of course, you still need to connect to a VPN when logging in, but this VPN only needs to be used during login, and then you can turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In daily use, Github Copilot is also heavily relied upon. This plugin can be directly used in VS Code and Visual Studio without switching between the two applications. Compared to ChatGPT, Github Copilot provides better support for projects, a more user-friendly interaction, and allows you to feed partial local files to it – &lt;strong&gt;“training” the AI&lt;/strong&gt; – so that the generated code is more aligned with your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cursor-ai&#34;&gt;Cursor AI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve come across a new AI programming IDE, Cursor AI. This IDE is based on Github Copilot, but it&amp;rsquo;s more intelligent and can help you create files directly.
I gave it a quick try and found it to be pretty good, however, its understanding of existing projects isn’t quite there yet. When dealing with large local project files, or major refactoring, optimization, and adjustments, developers still need to &lt;strong&gt;break down tasks&lt;/strong&gt;.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an example: Switching to Cursor’s engineering mode, inputting the following content: “Create a personal resume webpage, supporting multiple different styles switching, and remember to populate some personal information for data display.”
After several back-and-forths (&lt;strong&gt;pulling&lt;/strong&gt;), you can obtain the following webpage. Of course, this webpage is relatively simple, but it’s still quite good for beginners. ## Cursor AI

        <title>C&#43;&#43; Bitwise Operations Fundamentals: Bitwise Extraction and Flag Setting</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-bitwise-operations-basics-flags/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 02:23:56 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-bitwise-operations-basics-flags/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In actual C++ development, bitwise operations are a common technique, especially when dealing with system states, flags, or control bits. Bitwise operations can provide highly efficient solutions. This article will illustrate how to use bitwise operations to retrieve and set specific flags through an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bitwise-operations-fundamentals&#34;&gt;Bitwise Operations Fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In computers, data is stored in binary bits (0 and 1). Bitwise operations are operations performed on these binary bits. C++ provides several commonly used bitwise operators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise AND (&amp;amp;)&lt;/strong&gt;: Used to check if a particular bit is set to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise OR (|)&lt;/strong&gt;: Used to set a particular bit to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise XOR (^)&lt;/strong&gt;: Used to flip a particular bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise NOT (~)&lt;/strong&gt;: Inverts all the bits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left Shift (&amp;laquo;)&lt;/strong&gt;: Shifts all the bits to the left by a specified number of positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right Shift (&amp;raquo;)&lt;/strong&gt;: Shifts all the bits to the right by a specified number of positions.
In this example, we need to perform a series of bitwise operations on an &lt;code&gt;unsigned short&lt;/code&gt; variable &lt;code&gt;wInfo&lt;/code&gt; to represent different states using various flags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirement-analysis&#34;&gt;Requirement Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the description, we have a 16-bit flag to represent different states. These states are represented by various binary bits, with each binary bit corresponding to a specific meaning. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit0&lt;/strong&gt;: Failure status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit1&lt;/strong&gt;: Compression status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit2&lt;/strong&gt;: Incremental status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit3&lt;/strong&gt;: Presence of subsequent packets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bit5&lt;/strong&gt;: Normal request or cancellation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-bitwise-operations&#34;&gt;Using Bitwise Operations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will use bitwise operations to set and retrieve these flags. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise AND:&lt;/strong&gt; Retrieve the value of a particular bit (0 or 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise OR:&lt;/strong&gt; Set a particular bit to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitwise XOR:&lt;/strong&gt; Set a particular bit to 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first define an &lt;code&gt;unsigned short&lt;/code&gt; type variable &lt;code&gt;wInfo&lt;/code&gt; to store these flags. Then, we use bitwise operations to check and set the corresponding flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;c-example-code&#34;&gt;C++ Example Code
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Execute the code, recommended for old friends: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wandbox.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://wandbox.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;code-explanation&#34;&gt;Code Explanation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flag Definition&lt;/strong&gt;: Use shift operations (&lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; n&lt;/code&gt;) to define each flag bit. For example, &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to &lt;code&gt;bit0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to &lt;code&gt;bit1&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. This way, we allocate a unique binary position for each flag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check a Bit&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;isBitSet&lt;/code&gt; function uses the bitwise AND operation (&lt;code&gt;wInfo &amp;amp; bitMask&lt;/code&gt;) to check if a specific flag is set to 1. If the bit is 1, the function returns &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise it returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a Bit&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;setBit&lt;/code&gt; function uses the bitwise OR operation (&lt;code&gt;wInfo |= bitMask&lt;/code&gt;) to set a specific flag bit to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear a Bit&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;clearBit&lt;/code&gt; function uses the bitwise AND operation (&lt;code&gt;wInfo &amp;amp;= ~bitMask&lt;/code&gt;) to clear a specific flag bit to 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through bitwise operations, we can efficiently handle multiple state flags. This technique is particularly useful in practical development. For example, in embedded development, network protocols, and system status management scenarios, bit flags are often used to represent multiple binary states, saving space and improving efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this blog post helps you understand how to use bitwise operations in C++ to perform bitwise selection and setting, and mastering these skills is very helpful for writing efficient and maintainable code!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Upgrading from a desktop to a 2.5G network card, accelerating local area network connectivity.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/desktop-upgrade-to-25g-network-card-accelerate-lan-interconnection/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:37:52 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/desktop-upgrade-to-25g-network-card-accelerate-lan-interconnection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Desktop hardware three-in-one, in the previous text we mentioned PCIe adapter for solid state drives, where did the old SSDs go? Of course they weren&amp;rsquo;t wasted – if they were damaged, they were disassembled and installed on the newly purchased ‘MechMaker Mini-3765H’ (bought a year ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new machine has powerful hardware specifications: 2.5G dual network interfaces, PCIe4.0, WiFi6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I moved house and my room doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a dedicated router for networking, so the machines are connected via wireless networks. The ASUS motherboard desktop’s wireless card performance wasn’t great, or perhaps it was the router’s wireless access, which resulted in slow upload speeds between local networks, leading to poor network speeds between the machines. I purchased a 2.5G NIC and installed it on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At this point, all the slots on the motherboard are full: graphics card, wireless card, 2.5G NIC, PCIe adapter for solid state drives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;network-instructions&#34;&gt;Network Instructions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both machines connect to the internet using their original wireless network cards, but are directly connected via Ethernet cables between the two ends, with both sides equipped with 2.5G network cards.  The specifics of how to connect the Ethernet cables between the two machines aren&amp;rsquo;t detailed here – there are many tutorials available online; just remember to disable your firewall. You can select either machine as the gateway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ASUS Z490 motherboard has too many disks, resulting in intermittent disk unrecognition.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/asus-motherboard-z490-too-many-disks-intermittent-disk-recognition/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:08:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/asus-motherboard-z490-too-many-disks-intermittent-disk-recognition/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the previous text, an issue suddenly arose where the wireless network card was unable to be recognized. Before rebuilding the partitions, I had also researched other solutions online, such as: removing the motherboard battery and disconnecting power for fifteen minutes; upgrading to the latest version of the BOIS driver, but all attempts were unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking there were still tasks to complete, I switched to a limited network, pulling a web across from the living room into the room. At this point, even the wired network was unable to be recognized. I resorted to the ultimate solution – reinstalling the system, which resulted in partition loss during the boot process. If the issue had persisted continuously, I wouldn’t have spent so much time troubleshooting it; the ASUS disk conflict is intermittent, triggered by unstable system restarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I purchased a new 2TB solid-state drive from长江存储 (Changjiang Storage), an M.2 interface drive, and the machine never rebooted until yesterday when I shut it down once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reinstalling-the-system&#34;&gt;Reinstalling the System
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost two years since I last reinstalled the system, and my C drive is running out of space. Windows keeps having old issues, and various software likes to store things on C: Drive. So, I decided to reinstall the system. After reinstalling the system, the network card issue was resolved, and I restored my daily development environment the next day. While preparing to create a system backup, a new problem arose: after restarting the system, the boot partition disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the steps in the previous article, I rebuilt the boot partition; however, it wasn’t stable, and the partition would sometimes fail to load upon restart. I started to wonder if the chassis was malfunctioning when I realized that the hard drive cable was loose, but after several checks, there were no issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;memory-retrieval&#34;&gt;Memory Retrieval
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, this machine had once been equipped with a solid-state drive; it was like buying a new PCIE converter (plugged into the graphics card slot) instead of directly installing the hard drive onto the motherboard. This time, it’s installed directly on the motherboard, which may be due to an issue with the motherboard.

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motherboard manual has issues, with the labeled SATA port positions differing from the actual positions. Due to a large number of disks, all ports are populated with hard drives, with older SSDs utilizing SATA ports. According to the manual, there is a conflict between the ports. However, after testing, this conflict was found to be unstable and would trigger, causing the corresponding disk to fail to load – specifically, as it’s the system disk, the bootloader is also located on that disk, resulting in boot loader failure during system startup.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Exploring the Mysteries of ESP Partitions, GPT Partitions Table, and the Synergy with Windows Operating Systems</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday after work, I followed the usual routine of booting up my desktop computer. The system started normally but couldn&amp;rsquo;t load the wireless network card. I thought it might be loose, so I disassembled it and reinstalled the wireless card. That’s when things went really wrong – the system simply wouldn’t boot, and the boot loader failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a long time since I’d messed around with a desktop computer, and partitioning and booting felt a bit unfamiliar. I used DisGenius to create a blank partition (usually partitioned at the beginning of the disk) and assigned it as an ESP partition (defaulting to 300M). Then, within the PE system, I rebuilt the boot, and relevant information could be found online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of computer storage, the ESP partition, GPT partition table, and Windows operating system are closely linked, each playing a unique and crucial role in supporting the system’s stable operation and efficient management. However, before delving into their intricacies, we must acknowledge the “pioneers” – the MBR partition table format – that flowed through the history of computer partitioning. It mirrored subsequent technologies, further highlighting the evolution of technology. Today, let’s explore their inner connections and nuances in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-mbr-partition-table--the-foundation-of-traditional-hard-disk-partitioning&#34;&gt;I. MBR Partition Table – The “Foundation” of Traditional Hard Disk Partitioning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;MBR, which stands for Master Boot Record, has existed since the early days of personal computers and has dominated the hard disk partitioning landscape for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-basic-architecture&#34;&gt;1. Basic Architecture
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is located in the first sector of the hard disk, which is sector 0, occupying 512 bytes of space. These 512 bytes are primarily divided into three parts: firstly, the boot program code, responsible for loading the operating system&amp;rsquo;s boot loader during computer startup, typically 446 bytes; secondly, the disk partition table, occupying 64 bytes, which can define up to 4 main partitions, with each partition describing 16 bytes of information, recording the starting head, sector, and cylinder of the partition, as well as key parameters such as partition type and size; and finally, the last 2 bytes are the MBR end marker &amp;ldquo;55 AA&amp;rdquo;, used to identify this sector as a valid MBR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-historical-achievements-and-limitations&#34;&gt;2. Historical Achievements and Limitations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days, MBR partition tables fully met the storage needs of relatively simple personal computers. It allowed operating systems to seamlessly recognize hard disk partitions, enabling orderly data storage and retrieval. However, as times evolved, its limitations became increasingly apparent. Firstly, limited by a 64-byte partition table space, it could only define a maximum of 4 primary partitions. To create more partitions, complex methods such as extended partitions and logical partitions had to be used, which complicated disk management. Secondly, its maximum support was only 2TB of hard drives, which seemed inadequate in the face of today’s large-capacity drives routinely measuring several TB or even tens of TB – this became a bottleneck that constrained further development of storage technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-esp-partition--the-systems-invisible-boot-key&#34;&gt;II. ESP Partition – The System’s “Invisible Boot Key”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESP, which stands for EFI System Partition, is a special partition required by computers based on the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-functional-features&#34;&gt;1. Functional Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boot Loader&lt;/strong&gt;: When the computer starts up, UEFI firmware first searches for the ESP partition on the hard drive and reads the boot loader (such as Windows Boot Manager) stored within it, thereby launching the operating system. This is like a precise key that opens the door to system startup; without it, the system would be lost and confused during startup, not knowing where to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage Driver&lt;/strong&gt;: The ESP partition also stores some driver programs necessary for the boot process to ensure that hardware devices (such as hard disk controllers, graphics cards, etc.) function normally in the early stages of booting, laying the foundation for the smooth takeover of the operating system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-space-requirements-and-formatting&#34;&gt;2. Space Requirements and Formatting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, ESP partition sizes should range from 100MB to 500MB, with an allocation of around 200MB generally sufficient for basic needs. Its file system format must be FAT32, as UEFI firmware can only recognize FAT32 formatting to read boot files, ensuring compatibility and cross-platform support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-gpt-partition-table--the-hard-drives-smart-manager&#34;&gt;Three. GPT Partition Table – The Hard Drive’s “Smart Manager”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT (GUID Partition Table), also known as the Globally Unique Identifier Partition Table, is a new partitioning scheme designed to replace the traditional MBR partition table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-advantages-demonstrated&#34;&gt;1. Advantages Demonstrated
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Capacity Support:&lt;/strong&gt; In this era of exploding data, large-capacity hard drives are emerging one after another. GPT partition tables break the MBR&amp;rsquo;s 2TB capacity limit, theoretically enabling support for up to 9.4ZB (zettabytes – 1ZB = 1024 EB, 1EB = 1024 PB, 1PB = 1024 TB) of ultra-large storage space, providing possibilities for storing massive amounts of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numerous Partition Numbers:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike MBR which can only partition a maximum of 4 primary partitions, GPT allows the creation of up to 128 partitions, giving users and system administrators great flexibility whether it’s partitioning multiple systems partitions, data partitions, or reserving partitions for special purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Reliability:&lt;/strong&gt; The GPT partition table employs redundancy backup mechanisms, storing partition table information in both the head and tail of the hard drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-structural-analysis&#34;&gt;2. Structural Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GPT partition table consists of multiple components, including a protected MBR (maintained as a small portion of the traditional BIOS structure for compatibility with legacy BIOS and not used for actual partition management), a GPT header (storing basic information about the GPT partition table such as partition table version, number of partitions, partition table size, etc.), and a partition entry array (each partition entry details key information such as the starting sector, ending sector, partition type GUID, and unique identifier for each partition). These structures work together to precisely plan and manage disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-windows-operating-system--the-users-digital-interaction-heaven&#34;&gt;Four. Windows Operating System – The User’s “Digital Interaction Heaven”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows, as the world’s most widely used operating system, builds a friendly bridge between people and computer hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-fusion-of-esp-and-gpt-partition-tables&#34;&gt;1. Fusion of ESP and GPT Partition Tables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Windows system installation based on UEFI booting, the installer automatically creates an ESP (Extensible Firmware Interface) partition and deploys boot files to it. Simultaneously, the hard drive is initialized with a GPT (GUID Partition Table) partition scheme, dividing it into system reserved partitions (used for storing critical system files, similar to the system boot file area in traditional BIOS), Windows system partitions (where the core system files are installed), and other user-defined data partitions. The Windows system relies on the GPT partition table to precisely identify each partition, enabling seamless booting through the ESP partition, and ensuring a smooth boot and usage experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-system-management-and-optimization-based-on&#34;&gt;2. System Management and Optimization Based on
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During operation, Windows fully utilizes the advantages of the GPT partition table for disk management. For example, in the Disk Management tool, it can easily identify GPT partitions, allowing users to create, delete, format, and adjust partition sizes – meeting different data storage needs at various stages. Furthermore, processes such as system updates and software installations are closely related to partition layouts.  A rational partition plan helps improve system performance and stability, and reduces issues caused by insufficient disk space or partition confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v-practical-tips-maintenance-and-troubleshooting&#34;&gt;V. Practical Tips: Maintenance and Troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you understand their close relationship, daily maintenance and troubleshooting have a clear process to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-disk-space-management&#34;&gt;1. Disk Space Management
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly check ESP partition space to avoid running out of space due to installing too many startup-related software, which can affect system boot. For data partitions under GPT partitions, plan storage appropriately, promptly clean up unnecessary files, and prevent a single partition from filling up to impact system operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-troubleshooting-startup-failures&#34;&gt;2. Troubleshooting Startup Failures
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the system fails to start, first check if the ESP (EFI System Partition) is damaged or files are missing. You can use the startup repair tool built into the UEFI firmware, or enter the Windows recovery environment using an installation media to rebuild the boot files of the ESP partition. If you suspect a GPT partition table failure, use a professional disk utility (such as DiskGenius) to check the integrity of the partition table and attempt to repair it by restoring backup partition information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ESP partition, GPT partition table, and Windows operating system are like a precise team working together, each playing its part to create a stable and efficient computer usage environment for us. Understanding them deeply not only helps us handle system installation and maintenance with confidence but also allows us to understand the underlying logic of computer operation and explore the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deeply understand GCC, GLIBC, and C&#43;&#43; program compatibility issues</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/deep-understanding-gcc-glibc-cpp-compatibility-issues/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 19:51:16 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/deep-understanding-gcc-glibc-cpp-compatibility-issues/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the C++ development field, GCC and GLIBC are two indispensable key elements, and compatibility issues after program release often trouble developers. This article will delve into their essence, explore the root causes of compatibility problems, and investigate coping strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-gcc-a-powerful-compiler-cornerstone&#34;&gt;I. GCC: A Powerful Compiler Cornerstone
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition and Function&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCC, or GNU Compiler Collection, is a suite of open-source compilers developed by the GNU project. It’s far from a typical compiler; it supports a wide range of programming languages including C, C++, Objective - C, Fortran, Ada, and Go, providing a one-stop solution for cross-language development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking C++ as an example, when we write a source file containing complex features like classes, templates, and function overloading, GCC can translate the advanced C++ code into low-level machine instructions that can be understood and executed by the system. This process involves multiple fine-grained stages such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-gcc-a-powerful-compiler-foundation&#34;&gt;I. GCC: A Powerful Compiler Foundation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compilation Process Details&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preprocessing Stage:&lt;/strong&gt; GCC first performs preprocessing operations on the source file. During this stage, it handles all preprocessor directives starting with &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;, such as &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt; instructions. These instructions embed the entire content of specified header files (e.g., &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for C++ input/output stream operations) into the corresponding locations in the source file, allowing programs to use functions, classes, and other resources declared in those headers; macro definitions using &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt; are also expanded and replaced during this stage, such as &lt;code&gt;#define PI 3.14159&lt;/code&gt;.  Every occurrence of &lt;code&gt;PI&lt;/code&gt; in the source file is then replaced with &lt;code&gt;3.14159&lt;/code&gt;. After preprocessing, the source file undergoes an initial &amp;ldquo;expansion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compilation Stage:&lt;/strong&gt; The preprocessed file enters the compilation stage, where GCC converts the source file into assembly language code based on the C++ language standard. It carefully checks the code structure, ensuring that class inheritance and polymorphism implementations are correct, as well as that function call parameters match. Upon detecting errors that violate the grammatical semantics, it immediately reports them and terminates the compilation process. For example, if the parameter list in a function declaration does not match its definition, GCC will accurately pinpoint the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-gcc-a-powerful-compiler-cornerstone-1&#34;&gt;I. GCC: A Powerful Compiler Cornerstone
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assembly Stage:&lt;/strong&gt; The assembler converts the assembly code generated in the previous step into machine code, producing object files with a &lt;code&gt;.o&lt;/code&gt; extension. These object files contain binary instructions that can be directly executed by the machine, but they cannot run independently because a complete program is typically composed of multiple modules, and function and variable references between these modules have not yet been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linking Stage:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the final sprint to generate an executable file. The linker integrates multiple object files as well as required libraries (static or dynamic) together. For example, when using container classes from the C++ Standard Template Library, linking requires finding the corresponding library implementation code to ensure that the program can correctly call functions of objects like &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; at runtime, ultimately generating a complete executable program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-glibc-the-backbone-of-c-program-execution&#34;&gt;II. GLIBC: The Backbone of C++ Program Execution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature and Function&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GLIBC, or the GNU C Library, is a concrete implementation of the C standard library within the GNU ecosystem. Although its name emphasizes C, C++ programs heavily rely on it as well, because C++ inherits its foundational elements. It provides a vast array of basic functions, such as those for memory management – &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; (dynamic memory allocation) and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; (memory deallocation) – which are indispensable when creating dynamic arrays and objects in C++, as well as string manipulation functions like &lt;code&gt;strcpy&lt;/code&gt; (string copy) and &lt;code&gt;strcat&lt;/code&gt; (string concatenation). Even though C++ has a more advanced &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; class, these functions are still frequently used at the underlying level when interacting with C code or striving for extreme performance, as well as in early C++ development and scenarios where simplicity is paramount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-glibc-the-backbone-of-c-program-execution-1&#34;&gt;II. GLIBC: The Backbone of C++ Program Execution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration with the Operating System&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GLIBC acts as a crucial bridge between the operating system and applications. In Linux systems, when a C++ program initiates a system call – such as opening a file (using the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; function, which relies on GLIBC’s implementation), GLIBC encapsulates the program&amp;rsquo;s request in a manner conforming to the operating system kernel’s specifications and passes it to the kernel for processing. Upon completion by the kernel, GLIBC returns the results to the application. This allows applications to utilize various system resources – such as file systems, networks, and process management – without needing to delve into the complex details of the underlying system call interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-compatibility-issues-after-c-program-deployment-an-analysis&#34;&gt;III. Compatibility Issues After C++ Program Deployment: An Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatibility Dilemmas Triggered by Differences in GLIBC Version&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different Linux distributions often feature different versions of GLIBC. When a C++ program is compiled in a newer GLIBC environment, it may unknowingly utilize certain new function features or rely on optimized function implementations introduced in that version. For example, a newer GLIBC version has improved the memory allocation algorithm; the program frequently utilizes this new algorithm to enhance performance during runtime. Once this program is deployed on a lower-version GLIBC system, it may encounter issues such as failing to find the corresponding function (because the older version did not introduce it) or abnormal function behavior (the old implementation logic differs from the new one), leading to program crashes or incorrect results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-compatibility-issues-after-c-program-publishing-an-analysis&#34;&gt;III. Compatibility Issues After C++ Program Publishing: An Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compatibility Risks Due to Compiler Differences&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when using the same GCC compiler, differences between different versions of GCC in terms of code generation, standard library support, and implementation details for C++ features can lead to compatibility issues. Newer GCC versions may have full support for the latest C++ standards (such as new feature modules in C++20 like coroutines), and if a program uses these advanced features and is compiled under an older GCC version, the compiler will error out due to its inability to recognize these new syntax structures. Even without syntax errors, different GCC versions have different optimization strategies, which can lead to significant differences in machine code generated in terms of execution efficiency and memory usage. In performance-critical scenarios, this can cause programs to behave differently in different environments. - &lt;strong&gt;Challenges Posed by Architectural Differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++ programs may need to run on different hardware system architectures, such as x86, ARM, and PowerPC. These architectures have unique instruction sets, memory layouts, and data alignment requirements. For example, a structure data layout that runs correctly on an x86 architecture might cause memory access exceptions on an ARM architecture due to differing alignment rules, leading to program errors. Furthermore, GCC generates significantly different machine code when compiling for various architectures; if the program contains hardcoded architectural-specific instructions or assumptions, it will inevitably fail during cross-architecture execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-strategies-for-addressing-compatibility-issues&#34;&gt;Four. Strategies for Addressing Compatibility Issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utilization of Static Link Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using static link libraries, packaging the code of libraries that your program depends on (such as GLIBC) directly into the executable file. This eliminates the need for the target system’s specific GLIBC version at runtime, effectively preventing issues caused by GLIBC version mismatches. However, static linking will significantly increase the size of the executable file, requiring a trade-off in resource-constrained scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containerized Deployment&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leveraging containerization technologies like Docker, encapsulate your C++ program and its required runtime environment (including specific versions of GCC, GLIBC, etc.) within an independent container. Regardless of the underlying operating system to which it is deployed, the container maintains consistency with the development environment, ensuring that the program runs as expected and greatly simplifies cross-environment deployment complexity. - &lt;strong&gt;Compatibility Testing and Continuous Integration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a comprehensive compatibility testing system, covering different GLIBC versions, GCC versions, and common system architectures. During the software development process, use continuous integration tools to perform automated testing on multiple environments regularly. Once compatibility issues are identified, they are promptly fixed, eliminating potential problems at their earliest stages and ensuring stability after program deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-strategies-for-addressing-compatibility-issues-1&#34;&gt;Four. Strategies for Addressing Compatibility Issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a summary, a deep understanding of the workings of GCC and GLIBC, accurately identifying the root causes of C++ compatibility issues, and flexibly applying appropriate strategies are essential skills for every C++ developer to build robust, cross-platform applications. Only in this way can our C++ works run smoothly within diverse technological ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure from what version it started, but in Windows 11, the Disk Cleanup tool has been significantly improved and become much smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is that it&amp;rsquo;s an official tool, so it won’t accidentally delete files, won’t have ads, won’t have pop-ups, won’t have background processes, or any unnecessary elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access the Disk Cleanup tool in Windows 11 by going to &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;Storage&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;Temporary Files&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For regular users, simply selecting “Clean Recommendations” is sufficient; the system will provide suggestions based on your usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I have many temporary files on my disk, so I choose &amp;ldquo;Temporary Files,&amp;rdquo; which contains items like Visual Studio temporary files and Windows Update temporary files, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Docker Domestic Mirror Proxy Failed</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/docker-domestic-mirror-failure/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 18:29:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/docker-domestic-mirror-failure/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Deploying Docker on domestic servers, after deployment, if the company doesn’t provide a registry center, the first thing developers need to do is configure a domestic registry acceleration address. It&amp;rsquo;s lucky that today there was a server configured with a registry acceleration address, but when pulling images, it kept failing to pull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error response from daemon: “Get &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/&lt;/a&gt;”: net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- 20250106 – Two days after, all servers were restored, and this issue didn’t even make the news. All domestic registry proxies went down --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting-and-repair-attempts&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting and Repair Attempts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, we attempted to switch to alternative mirror acceleration addresses, hoping to resolve the issue. However, as expected, the problem persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, we began modifying the local DNS configuration in an attempt to find a breakthrough at the network parsing level. Unfortunately, after some debugging, the fault remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the stability of the local network was heavily questioned, so we decisively switched to a mobile hotspot, attempting to bypass potential local network faults. However, the result was discouraging – there were no signs of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-propagation&#34;&gt;Problem Propagation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We currently have &lt;strong&gt;a few servers deployed domestically&lt;/strong&gt; with Docker environments, and all of them failed to successfully pull the image. We initially hoped to find an alternative solution, but we found that they all consistently failed with identical error messages, indicating that the issue isn&amp;rsquo;t isolated to a single device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further investigation revealed that the image proxy seemingly malfunctioned instantaneously. In this critical moment, we quickly switched to a machine outside of the country, and thankfully, image pulls were restored at this location. This suggests that the problem is highly likely related to the domestic network links or associated configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strategy-adjustment-circumventing-solutions&#34;&gt;Strategy Adjustment: Circumventing Solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that direct image pulling routes within China have been heavily restricted, while foreign mirrors remain accessible, to expedite project progress, we’ve decided to employ a circumvention tactic. Initially, we switched to foreign servers to successfully pull the required images, subsequently pushing them to domestic mirror repositories to establish a “data bridge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we synchronized modifications to the Dockerfile files, replacing image addresses with those adapted for the Chinese environment and then rebuilt the images, ultimately achieving successful deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The End of the Age of Barbaric Capital: The End of the League of Legends Esports Era</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-era-league-of-legends-esports/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:19:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-era-league-of-legends-esports/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The esports industry has experienced rapid development over the past decade and a half, becoming an increasingly significant cultural phenomenon worldwide. Particularly games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; (LoL), a MOBA title, have not only provided players with competitive enjoyment but also injected substantial momentum into capital investment, driving the flourishing development of various esports platforms and events. However, this all entered a phase of gradual decline alongside increased capital influx and the rise of the broader entertainment industry. The rise and fall of PandaTV, the competition between DouYu and Huya, marked the end of the “wild capitalism era,” and it seems that the favorable conditions – time, place, people, and heaven – for esports are also beginning to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-injection&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Injection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1 Early Esports: From Grassroots to Professionalization&lt;/strong&gt;
The early esports industry started relatively grassroots, especially in the Chinese market. Many players participated in competitive games like &lt;em&gt;StarCraft&lt;/em&gt; and Dota, driven by their love for gaming. However, the true rise of esports began with the release and promotion of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Following the official entry of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; into the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche community to part of mainstream culture. Notably, starting in 2013, the LPL (China Professional League) was established, and &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; became the cornerstone of China’s esports industry.
&lt;strong&gt;1.2 Capital Flood: The Rise of PandaTV and Esports Streaming Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;
2015 marked a watershed moment for China&amp;rsquo;s esports industry. The influx of capital transformed esports from purely competitive events into a much larger ecosystem. Pandahua (PandaTV), as one representative, became a product of excessive capital. Founded by Wang Sicong (one of the founders of PandaLive), Pandahua quickly rose to prominence with its innovative content and massive investment, attracting a large number of viewers and users. However, this was also a typical example of capital “barbaric” inflow – the market’s frantic pursuit of capital often lacks patience and foresight. Although Pandahua&amp;rsquo;s financial and human resources achieved certain results in the short term, it ultimately collapsed in 2019 due to management issues and excessive reliance on capital fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.3 Live Streaming Platform Competition: The “Capital War” between DouYu and Tiggy (虎牙)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-injection-1&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Injection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline of PandaTV did not lead to a decline in the esports live streaming industry; instead, it fueled the rise of platforms like DouYu and Huya. The two major live streaming platforms quickly became leaders in the esports industry, with competition between them intensifying. DouYu initially established itself as a benchmark for esports live streaming through its broadcasts of professional &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; tournaments and by signing top streamers. Meanwhile, Huya gradually narrowed the gap with DouYu through increased investment in esports events and its own diversified platform layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, capital played a significant role once again. In 2018, DouYu successfully went public, and Huya also completed an IPO the same year. The rapid flow of capital led to industry consolidation and resulted in intense competition between platforms regarding streamers and copyrights, forming a “capital battle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-fusion-of-mass-entertainment-and-esports&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Fusion of Mass Entertainment and Esports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1 The Trend Towards Mass Entertainment: Capital Flows into Diversified Entertainment Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As capital has heavily invested in the esports industry, the content on esports platforms is gradually becoming mass-entertained. Esports anchors are no longer limited to match commentary and event live streaming; they have begun to expand into singing, dancing, interactive live streams, and other entertainment forms. The content on the platform is becoming more diverse, gradually forming an ecosystem centered around esports but also incorporating various entertainment elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, mass entertainmentization has also brought problems – the original focus of esports culture has been marginalized, replaced by a trend of entertainment supremacy. This trend has caused some fans who originally loved esports culture to feel alienated, and capital is beginning to shift its attention to other entertainment fields. - Excessive capital influx and profit-seeking have gradually blurred the essence of the esports industry, with core values centered around competition weakening.
&lt;strong&gt;2.2 Rise of the General Entertainment Industry: Capital Withdrawal and Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;
As short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and the entertainment industry (including K-pop) have risen, capital has gradually shifted from esports to a broader range of entertainment content. In this process, giants such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance no longer rely solely on esports projects for profit, but have increased their investments in areas such as film, music, and short videos.  In particular, the rise of ByteDance, through the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin (TikTok), has overshadowed esports with other entertainment content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-three-league-of-legends-yellow-doesnt-follow-yellow-the-decline-of-the-eras-advantage&#34;&gt;Chapter Three: League of Legends’ “Yellow Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Follow Yellow”: The Decline of the Era’s Advantage
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has almost been synonymous with China’s esports industry, achieving countless professional players, teams, and events, and also spawning a massive esports ecosystem. However, after more than a decade, as a leading project in Chinese esports, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; has entered a phase of “Yellow Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Follow Yellow.” Particularly in recent years, the influence of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; is gradually declining, even exhibiting obvious signs of decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1 The &amp;ldquo;Fracture&amp;rdquo; in Player Demographics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most noticeable change is the fragmentation of player demographics. Initially, esports’ rapid development relied on the support of a large number of young players who became professional players or spectators thanks to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. That generation of internet addiction teenagers almost grew up under the “timeshare dividend.” They were immersed in the competitive appeal of League of Legends and, as a result, drove the rapid expansion of the entire industry. However, with the passage of time, these players gradually matured, entered society, and began to shift towards other life and career paths. Simultaneously, the interest of the new generation of young players in &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; was not as fervent as it once was, and the esports audience has developed a noticeable age bias and decline in interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-league-of-legends-yellow-never-follows-green-the-decline-of-the-eras-advantage&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: League of Legends’ “Yellow Never Follows Green”: The Decline of the Era’s Advantage
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2 The “Stagnation” of Game Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, despite numerous updates and revisions, has begun to show a lack of fundamental innovation in its game content. Annual version releases, hero balance adjustments, and the introduction of new gameplay mechanics seem unable to fundamentally address players’ demand for novelty. Simultaneously, the MOBA market is becoming increasingly saturated, with other games (such as &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;) rapidly rising in popularity and diverting a significant portion of the player base that was once dedicated to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. This competitive landscape has left &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; perpetually in the role of “chaser.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-where-does-the-esports-industry-go-from-here&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Where Does the Esports Industry Go From Here?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The esports industry is like a skyscraper that sprung up seemingly overnight. Excessive capital roams within the internet industry, searching for the next big trend, and esports has become one of their targets. Leveraging China’s demographic dividend, the esports industry achieved tremendous success in a short period. However, this success wasn&amp;rsquo;t built on a solid foundation. Over-investment by capital, talent shortages, and weak game content are all hindering the healthy development of the esports industry. Prior to university, I didn’t play many games, and the League of Legends was essentially a companion throughout my growth. I watched so many World Championships, and as an outsider, comparing Chinese and Korean players, especially Faker, domestic players always felt apprehensive and hesitant during major tournaments. I also understand that professional gamers face immense psychological pressure, but this industry has developed for over ten years, and their mental health issues should be prioritized by the teams – which they weren’t. Domestic gameplay still relies on individual player talent.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Games to Home: Why We Gradually Distance Ourselves from the Virtual World as We Grow Up</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:11:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When did I ever feel the most joy playing games? As a child, sneaking onto my parents’ TV to play Tank War, Super Mario, and Space Invaders, or secretly using our computer with my cousin to play Age of Empires – or even in college, playing Devil May Cry and League of Legends with my roommates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, there were no worries about life, and when we played, we truly immersed ourselves completely. That sense of immersion is something you can never find again as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the changes in times and societal progress, those of us who were once active in the virtual world have gradually realized that the platform filled with joy and competition seems to be drifting away from our lives. The disconnection of game social links, accompanied by players falling out of line, is not only due to technological advancements and the replacement of games themselves, but also because of a shift in our center of gravity in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disappearance-of-gaming-socialization-a-tug-of-war-between-virtual-and-real-worlds&#34;&gt;The Disappearance of Gaming Socialization: A Tug-of-War Between Virtual and Real Worlds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people’s youth, games were more than just entertainment; they were a social way to connect. A popular multiplayer online game didn&amp;rsquo;t just offer in-game challenges and competition – it connected players from all over the world, building virtual social circles. Back then, playing dungeons together, forming teams for PvP combat, was part of life. Those late-night voice chats and sharing of daily experiences became a cherished memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as time went on, more and more players discovered that this virtual socialization experience didn’t have lasting appeal. With game updates and the diversification of social platforms, players gradually found more interactive ways to connect outside of games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gaming-and-responsibility-the-shift-in-focus-of-adult-life&#34;&gt;Gaming and Responsibility: The Shift in Focus of Adult Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you enter adulthood, responsibilities gradually increase. Many young people once invested a significant amount of time in games, but as their careers begin or they start living with partners and forming families, these activities that previously seemed indispensable entertainment are increasingly squeezed by the demands of real-life responsibility. Marriage, having children, even caring for parents – these major life responsibilities force individuals to make choices about their energy and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming becomes a thing of the past, replaced by the priority of family life. Many young people who once “fought” in games gradually discover that real life is the most important subject. Especially after having children, the focus of life completely shifts towards family, and gaming is gradually pushed to the periphery of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-games-to-home-how-life-changes-influence-our-entertainment&#34;&gt;From Games to Home: How Life Changes Influence Our Entertainment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within our life experiences, the family is one of the most important components. And once we enter family life, the division of time and energy becomes more specific and limited. To care for children and spend time with spouses, many young parents find that they no longer have enough time to focus on games they used to love. They often even stop chasing updates and new features in games. Gradually, social platforms and offline interactions with friends and family have become the preferred way for more people to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean we completely abandon entertainment activities; it simply means we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen ways that better suit our current stage of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-farewell-of-virtual-worlds-how-do-we-view-this-transition&#34;&gt;The Farewell of Virtual Worlds: How Do We View This Transition?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many who were once immersed in games, saying goodbye to gaming social wasn’t easy. After all, the virtual world that had once brought us joy and accomplishment had long become a part of our memories. However, farewell doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean complete severance; it’s about making different choices as life changes, balancing our roles in real-life. As we grow older from our youthful beginnings into responsible adults, games may still have their value, but they can no longer be the main rhythm of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this transition also reflects a facet of human adaptability – our ability to adjust our focus and lifestyle as different stages of life unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-of-gaming-perhaps-well-see-another-wave-of-sense-of-belonging&#34;&gt;The Future of Gaming: Perhaps We’ll See Another Wave of “Sense of Belonging”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, as society and technology continue to develop, the forms and content of games are constantly evolving. For example, modern multiplayer online games have begun to move towards more relaxed and flexible ways of playing, with some designs even focusing on family interaction and parent-child relationships. In the future, we may see more game formats that can better integrate into family life and provide players with healthier, more balanced social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as many people reminisce about “games from their childhood” with nostalgia and passion, perhaps in the future we will unexpectedly rediscover those games, bringing with us new understanding and insights, and once again step into that virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;living-in-change-yet-still-loving&#34;&gt;Living in Change, Yet Still Loving
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s games or family life, the changes in our lives always accompany us as we grow. In this process, we gradually realize that, although the virtual world brings us endless joy and excitement, ultimately, we will return to reality, back to the warmest place of all – family. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to regret leaving games behind because every stage of life has its own unique meaning. And these changes are what make us a more complete person.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hong Kong Exchange, History of Virtual Currency Development</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-stock-exchange-virtual-currency-history/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:00:28 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binance again elected as US President, also bringing virtual currencies back into the public eye. The Hong Kong Exchange has been actively deploying related business, here’s a simple record of the Hong Kong Exchange&amp;rsquo;s virtual currency development history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the details of relevant contract lists, we found that the initial introduction wasn’t spot contracts but futures – which is reasonable, as futures markets have better liquidity and are easier to attract institutional investors. The subsequent introduction of spot ETFs was also reasonable, as ETFs are a more readily accepted investment tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;virtual-currency-list&#34;&gt;Virtual Currency List
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchange’s market data does not provide identifiers to distinguish between contracts that are virtual currencies. However, they can be determined by the contract name. The official trading list provides corresponding subcategories &lt;code&gt;virtualasset&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.hkex.com.hk/Market-Data/Securities-Prices/Exchange-Traded-Products?sc_lang=en&amp;amp;asset=virtualasset&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;december-16-2022&#34;&gt;December 16, 2022
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-hong-kong-stock-exchange-welcomes-the-first-batch-of-crypto-asset-etfs-listed-in-asia&#34;&gt;The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Welcomes the First Batch of Crypto Asset ETFs Listed in Asia
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (Hong Kong Stock Exchange) today (Friday) welcomed the listing of the first batch of crypto asset ETFs listed in Asia, further expanding its product ecosystem and providing more choices for investors in Hong Kong and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two new ETFs listed today – Southern East One Bitcoin Futures ETF (stock code: 3066) and Southern East One Ethereum Futures ETF (stock code: 3068) – are managed by Southern East One Asset Management Co., Ltd., and track standardized, cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts and ether futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two crypto asset ETFs listed today add another layer of richness and diversity to Hong Kong’s increasingly vibrant exchange trading product ecosystem,” said Mr. Yao Jia Ren, Chief Operating Officer and Head of Market Linkage at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. These new products will provide investors with the opportunity to participate in digital asset investments for the first time in Asia, and reflect our focus on the digital economy and market demand. “We look forward to bringing more thematic ETFs and new digital assets products in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETF is one of Hong Kong Exchange’s fastest-growing business areas, and its product range has continued to expand and diversify in 2022, including the launch of the first metaverse ETF, the first carbon futures ETF, and the first blockchain ETF, as well as the first time incorporating ETFs into the Hong Kong–Shenzhen–Guangzhou (HSG) Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-hong-kong-exchange-and-clearing-hkex-welcomes-the-first-batch-of-crypto-asset-etfs-listed-in-asia&#34;&gt;The Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing (HKEX) Welcomes the First Batch of Crypto Asset ETFs Listed in Asia
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, HKEX’s exchange-traded products (ETPs – including ETFs and leveraged and inverse products) saw an average daily trading volume of HK$118 billion in the first ten months of this year, a 50% increase from HK$78 billion in the same period last year. This reflects the growing popularity of ETPs among investors. As of November 2022, there were 168 ETPs listed on HKEX with a total market capitalization of HK$3,735 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;april-30-2024&#34;&gt;April 30, 2024
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-hong-kong-exchange-welcomes-the-listing-of-the-first-batch-of-spot-virtual-asset-etfs&#34;&gt;The Hong Kong Exchange Welcomes the Listing of the First Batch of Spot Virtual Asset ETFs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (Hong Kong Exchange) today (Tuesday) welcomed the listing of Asia’s first batch of spot virtual asset ETFs, adding to the variety of products in the Hong Kong market and providing investors with more choices, further solidifying Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s position as a leading ETF market in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Robert Lin, Head of Securities Product Development at the Hong Kong Exchange, “The newly listed spot virtual asset ETFs will enrich the diversified and dynamic ETF market ecosystem of the Hong Kong Exchange, offering investors new investment opportunities in asset classes. Following the successful launch of virtual asset futures ETFs a year ago, Asia’s first batch of spot virtual asset ETFs will further enhance the product variety and liquidity traded by the Hong Kong Exchange. We look forward to continuing to work closely with stakeholders in the market to introduce more new products into our internationalized market.” “The first batch of virtual asset futures ETFs listed in 2022 were highly favored by investors, with robust trading volumes. The average daily trading volume of the three virtual asset futures ETFs listed on the Hong Kong Exchange increased from HK$890 million in 2023 to HK$5.13 billion in the first quarter of 2024, while attracting HK$5.29 billion in inflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchange-traded products (ETFs, leveraged and inverse products included) are one of the fastest-growing markets at the Hong Kong Exchange, with the number of product types continuously increasing over the past year. The 16 new ETF products launched in 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 include the first APAC-listed Saudi Arabian ETF and the first batch of callable options ETFs in Hong Kong. Currently, there are 179 ETFs listed on the Hong Kong Exchange.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;hong-kong-exchange-to-launch-virtual-asset-index-series&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Exchange to Launch Virtual Asset Index Series
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (Hong Kong Exchange) announced today (Monday) that it will launch the Hong Kong Exchange Virtual Asset Index Series (the Index Series) on November 15, 2024, providing a reliable benchmark price for the rapidly growing asset class of virtual assets, supporting Hong Kong’s development as a leading digital asset hub in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index series will provide transparent and reliable benchmarks for the pricing of Bitcoin and Ethereum within the Asian time zone, aiming to offer a unified reference price for virtual assets and address price discrepancies between this asset class across global exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchange &amp;amp; Clearing Group Chairman Chen Yiting said: “We are delighted to launch the Hong Kong Exchange Virtual Asset Index Series to meet the demand for this rapidly growing asset class in the region.” “By providing transparent and reliable real-time benchmarks, we aim to help investors make informed investment decisions, thereby supporting the healthy development of the virtual asset ecosystem and consolidating Hong Kong’s position as an international financial center.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of this index series is part of the Hong Kong Exchange’s commitment to exploring emerging areas. It supports the development of Hong Kong Fintech while also providing investors with important benchmarks and solutions in a constantly evolving market environment.
The index series will include reference indices for Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as reference exchange rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hong-kong-exchange-to-launch-virtual-asset-index-series-1&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Exchange to Launch Virtual Asset Index Series
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark index will be based on the 24-hour weighted average spot prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum, calculated according to the aggregated market prices from major virtual asset exchanges. The index will be denominated in US dollars in real time. The reference rate is designed for financial product settlement and is calculated daily at 4:00 PM Hong Kong Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This index series will be the first compliant virtual asset index series in Hong Kong that meets European Union Benchmark Regulation (EUBMR) standards, managed and calculated jointly by a benchmark management company registered in the UK and virtual asset data and index provider CCData.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region issued a policy statement on the development of virtual assets, aiming to cultivate a vibrant virtual asset industry and ecosystem in Hong Kong. The launch of the Hong Kong Exchange Virtual Assets Index Series will provide public access to real-time data and daily reference prices in Asian time zones, helping to increase understanding of trends in virtual asset investment. More details regarding the design and calculation methods of the index series will be released as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>“Fee reduction, fee reduction! Domestic mega-ETFs are experiencing a large-scale fee reduction.”</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/reduced-fees-large-domestic-etf/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 03:08:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/reduced-fees-large-domestic-etf/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ping An Blockchain ETF et al. announced a reduction in the overall fee rate to the lowest level among peers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 19th, China Merchants Bank Fund announced that, to better meet the investment and financial needs of investors, starting from November 22nd, it will reduce the management fees and custodian fees of Huatai Baorong Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 ETF and its affiliated funds, and revise relevant content in the fund contracts.
&lt;strong&gt;After the adjustment, the annual management fee for Huatai Baorong Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 ETF and its affiliated funds is reduced to 0.15%, the annual custodian fee is reduced to 0.05%, all set to the lowest fee level among index funds.&lt;/strong&gt;
Almost simultaneously, leading in size in the industry, China Merchants HuRun Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 ETF, China Merchants Shanghai Stock 50 ETF, Nanfang Zhongce 500 ETF, Guangxi Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 ETF, Yifada Entrepreneurial Board ETF et al. also announced a reduction in management and custodian fees, with all rates reduced to 0.15% and 0.05%. Unlike most ETFs experiencing fee cuts, this time the reduction was spearheaded by market-leading actively-traded products with significant scale advantages. This is expected to have a substantial impact on the industry going forward. Exchange data shows that as of November 18th, the size of Greater China Fund’s CSI 300 ETF exceeded 370 billion yuan, making it currently the largest ETF in terms of assets under management. The largest batch of super ETFs initiated fee cuts, demonstrating their willingness to offer value to investors and allowing investors to invest in popular and liquid funds at a higher cost-effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry experts believe that the reduction in expense ratios for large-scale ETFs will, on one hand, facilitate the public fund industry’s role in providing inclusive financial services, enabling investors to reduce holding costs and enhance their potential returns and investment satisfaction on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, low fee rates will also further improve the competitiveness of the products themselves. With the added benefits of liquidity diversion and cost operation advantages, these products are expected to attract more medium-to-long-term incremental capital into the market, helping to build a healthy ecosystem for “long money, long investment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, broad-based ETFs have become the primary channel for funds entering at low levels and engaging in “long money, long investment” due to their unique advantages such as flexible trading, high transparency, strong liquidity, and low investment barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fee reduction may serve as an &amp;ldquo;accelerator,&amp;rdquo; making it easier for long-term capital to enter the A-share market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Tianhong Fund that I invested in hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet released an announcement, it should be followed up on. If no update is provided, I will consider switching funds.
Original Management Fee: 0.5%, Custody Fee: 0.1%. New Management Fee: 0.15%, Custody Fee: 0.05%. This reduction is quite significant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>“Third-party custodian regulation is intensifying, and the behind-the-scenes winners of the ‘Douyin Stock Trading’ incident are facing a crackdown?”</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/third-party-wealth-managers-scrutiny-tiktok-stock-winners-crackdown/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:59:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/third-party-wealth-managers-scrutiny-tiktok-stock-winners-crackdown/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hammer is falling.
Following the wind of short videos, investment advisory services are reportedly entering a fast lane.
In late September this year, after a period of intense activity in the A-share market, recommendations on Douyin (TikTok) have attracted attention from various parties.
Leading financial commentators on Douyin have risen to prominence, indirectly causing some volatility in capital markets.
However, the rapid rise of these financial commentators is not to be ignored – it’s largely driven by third-party investment advisory firms.
According to reports, many third-party investment advisory firms operate multiple accounts on short video platforms, using content distribution (PV) to attract users to watch investment teaching videos and boost enthusiasm for purchasing corresponding advisory products.
There are even rumors that one third-party investment advisory firm generated revenue of 10 billion yuan in October alone, exceeding its first-half revenue this year.
But “good times” are facing more uncertainties. Since November, multiple departments have successively issued notices requiring securities service institutions to strengthen the compliant management of their self-media accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of November 15th, Tianhong Securities (300033.SZ) announced that its subsidiary was penalized by the China Securities Regulatory Commission for engaging in behavior such as hinting at recommending stocks through livestreaming operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be signaling to the market a stricter regulatory approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expansion prospects of third-party investment advisory service institutions, such as JiuFang ZhiTu (9636.HK), are also likely to face greater pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tight-regulation-monitoring&#34;&gt;Tight Regulation Monitoring
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of short video platforms like Douyin (TikTok) has amplified emotional voices and indirectly impacted trading behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Giant League of Finance’s monitoring, from September 27th to October 8th, when transaction volumes hit record highs, the Douyin A-share keyword search index soared from 4.2384 million to 12.7786 million, expanding by more than twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under such circumstances, the “pushing and pulling” behavior of third-party investment advisory firms is attracting the attention of regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of investment advisors recommending stocks through various means during live broadcasts is a high-frequency violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 8th, the Guangdong Securities Regulatory Bureau took regulatory measures to suspend new clients for a company that was found to be “hinting at stock recommendations” during a livestream. On November 14th, the Guangdong Securities Futures业协会 (Guangdong Securities and Futures Association) issued a notice titled “Live Streaming Control Lapses, Institutions Suspended Business,” directly addressing instances where some institutions with securities consulting qualifications exhibited inadequate control during live streaming operations. The notice also cited instances of recommending individual stocks within the live streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The practice of recommending stocks through live streaming is strictly prohibited. Given that live streaming constitutes public media dissemination, all livestream presenters – regardless of whether they are registered as securities investment advisors – shall not recommend individual stocks during live broadcasts.” The Guangdong Securities Futures业协会 stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an isolated incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, the Shanghai Stock Exchange also disclosed a penalty notice detailing one case involving illegal stock recommendations on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following regulatory investigation, Wang Yong, a consultant at Haishun Securities Investment Consulting Co., Ltd.’s Shanghai branch, violated industry norms by publishing misleading videos via WeChat Video Account, which contradicted professional standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tight-regulation-monitoring-1&#34;&gt;Tight Regulation Monitoring
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to information obtained by Wind (ID: TradeWind01), some ineligible investment advisory firms were using “front-running” brokers (ID:TradeWind01) on Douyin (TikTok) to recommend stocks, and they have since been suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Industry insiders are livestreaming, but in reality, they’re operating under the umbrella of a broker, which granted them investment advisor qualifications. They then use these livestreams to generate leads and sell advisory product bundles,” said a consultant from South China who spoke to Wind (ID: TradeWind01). “However, because they were recommending stocks during the livestream, it was discovered, leading to their suspension. Regular brokers typically discuss sector trends in investor education livestreams but wouldn’t delve into individual stocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, regulators are maintaining close scrutiny of illegal stock recommendations on social media platforms. For example, recent notices from the Shenzhen Securities Regulatory Commission have revealed that some individual institutions or individuals are engaging in illegal stock promotion through self-media, among other violations. To further regulate the self-media operations of securities investment consulting agencies within its jurisdiction, all institutions must strengthen their company’s self-media management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may pose more challenges for third-party wealth management service providers&amp;rsquo; business expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-flow-business-is-a-scam&#34;&gt;“The Flow Business” is a Scam
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether retail investors attracted by short videos have made money remains unknown, but the valuation of third-party investment advisory service companies as &amp;ldquo;water sellers&amp;rdquo; in the secondary market has soared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As China’s “first online teaching stock,” JiuFang Intelligence has seen its market capitalization rise from 2878 million yuan on September 9th to 12464 million yuan as of November 13th, with an increase of 333.08% over 49 trading days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The semi-annual report shows that in the first half of the year, JiuFang Intelligence conducted brand exposure on social media platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu, and by June 30th, it had 488 accounts and 46 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, as JiuFang Intelligence’s Chief Investment Advisor, “Hongbangzhu” (commonly known as “Hong”) has amassed 2.26 million followers on Douyin (TikTok).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have deeply cultivated MCN operations, focusing on the user-centric approach and synergistically promoting the comprehensive development of traffic, brands, and products.” “Nine Fang Intelligence Investment pointed out, “By deeply integrating new media tools such as live streaming and short videos, leveraging AI technology to build fan networks, and actively exploring e-commerce models, we effectively achieve the efficient conversion of traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine Fang Intelligence Investment’s investment consultant course packages cover a price range from several hundred yuan to over ten hundred thousand yuan. The most expensive package, ‘Super Investor,’ priced at 1396,000 yuan for six months, includes exclusive insights and private consulting services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Nine Fang Intelligence Investment’s investment consultant products have a return rate of over 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2024, the return rates for the flagship series and ‘Nine Fang Intelligent Dragon’ series reached 14.7% and 18.5%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the impact of regulatory headwinds on Nine Fang Intelligence Investment&amp;rsquo;s business development remains to be observed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-flow-business-is-false&#34;&gt;“The Flow Business” is False
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, media reports have stated that accounts belonging to third-party custodians such as Jiu Fang Zhi Tu have been affected recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, a report by a media outlet stated that &amp;ldquo;Hong Bangzhu&amp;rdquo; (洪帮主) was suspended from live streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on November 15th at 3:00 PM, Xin Feng (ID:TradeWind01) searched the account and found that the “Hong Bangzhu” livestream interface still allowed bookings for a livestream on November 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, market news indicated that relevant departments have intervened in Jiu Fang Zhi Tu’s inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a source close to Jiu Fang Zhi Tu told Xin Feng (ID:TradeWind01) that the investigation was a routine check and had already concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only company caught up in the rumors surrounding this regulatory storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reports that Tianhong Securities has been investigated for illegal stock recommendations and may be suspended from operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Tianhong Securities stated on November 15th that “there was no illegal stock recommendation situation and no investigation.” “However, that evening, Tianhe Securities announced that its subsidiary, Zhejiang Tianhe Securities Cloud Software Co., Ltd., was penalized by the Zhejiang Securities Regulatory Bureau for violations during its livestreaming promotional activities, specifically due to inadequate compliance controls and instances of hinting at recommended stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may also signify a further escalation in regulatory scrutiny regarding stock recommendations on social media platforms like Douyin (TikTok) Live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the short video market is attracting many brokerage firms, but due to compliance requirements, brokers are currently being cautious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-flow-business-is-forbidden&#34;&gt;“The Flow Business” is Forbidden
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A securities industry insider told Wind Info (ID:TradeWind01) that the company was exploring short video operations and lead generation methods, and had organized personnel to visit short video platform companies for learning. However, due to regulatory compliance requirements, it is currently in an exploratory phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, behind the various regulatory compliance requirements, is because short video content has a distinctly emotional color. But investors need to maintain rationality when dealing with it, and there is a natural conflict between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If emotional forces influence capital markets, it can easily trigger violent market fluctuations, which goes against the long-term healthy development of capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What way should securities firms embrace the arrival of the short video era to avoid “crossing the red line”? It’s clearly a difficult question for all parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CentOS Stream&lt;/code&gt; is the upstream open-source development platform prior to Red Hat’s &lt;code&gt;Linux&lt;/code&gt; distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first noticed the open-source operating system lifecycle &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/redhat-centos-lifecycle/&#34; &gt;redhat and centos life cycle&lt;/a&gt; had ended, and I was wondering what was going on? Besides security issues, dnf wasn’t working, and I recently encountered failures when installing tools – checking the repository sources revealed that &lt;code&gt;CentOS 8 Stream&lt;/code&gt; had reached its end of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;centos-stream-introduction&#34;&gt;CentOS Stream Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;positioning-and-roles&#34;&gt;Positioning and Roles
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream sits between Fedora Linux (upstream development) and RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux, downstream development), acting as a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be considered a version for experiencing the latest Red Hat-based Linux features, suitable for those who want to try out new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;origins-and-background&#34;&gt;Origins and Background
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, Red Hat began to seek more effective ways to develop its enterprise-grade Linux platform, leading to the launch of CentOS Stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentOS 8 ended maintenance at the end of 2021, and CentOS Stream continued to be updated as its successor, becoming the future direction of the CentOS project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-and-advantages&#34;&gt;Features and Advantages
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream is a rolling release Linux distribution that provides faster updates. It offers greater transparency and more opportunities for community, partner, and customer participation, allowing users to contribute to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) more quickly and directly.
The content of CentOS Stream is software that Red Hat intends to include in the next stable version of RHEL, therefore it provides a stable ABI/API for developers and testers within the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-cases-and-target-users&#34;&gt;Use Cases and Target Users
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream is suitable for those CentOS users who want to continue receiving the latest Linux feature updates, as well as developers and partners who wish to participate in Red Hat Enterprise Linux development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also aims to help community members, Red Hat partners, and others fully leverage innovative open-source software in a more stable and predictable Linux ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hugo Module Customizing Theme: Explanation of Approach</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hugo-module-custom-theme-ideas/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:01:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hugo-module-custom-theme-ideas/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the historical commit logs, the site has undergone numerous theme switches. Each theme switch involved some custom modifications, and this is where I’m documenting the approach to customizing themes. My &lt;code&gt;Github&lt;/code&gt; repository briefly maintained the even theme, but due to my obsessive-compulsive tendencies, I resisted upgrading the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; compiler to the latest version, which rendered the even theme incompatible, so I switched back to the &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugos-modularity&#34;&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Modularity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we talk about modularity, many people think of things like Nginx modules and IDEA plugins. Typically, I can upload various modules to satisfy my specific needs. The reason everyone likes this kind of module is that it’s incredibly flexible – you don’t have to put in too much effort to meet your own requirements. Often, even though the overall concepts are similar, there are always subtle differences. This highlights the complexity of software, not just technically, but also from a business perspective. Most often, we face business complexity. This is precisely where the saying “it’s like crossing a river and climbing a mountain” – “隔行如隔山” – is best illustrated. Today, not only the internet industry and the financial sector, even traditional manufacturing has adopted information systems to help with production and management. Here’s the English translation of the provided text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Similarly, even within the same industry, different companies will have variations in their leave systems. However, Hugo&amp;rsquo;s modules differ somewhat from what people typically expect – they aren’t organized based on functionality to meet specific differentiation needs. Instead, they are primarily structured around directory hierarchies to identify and recognize identical structures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@sunwei.xyz/07-hugo%E6%9E%B6%E6%9E%84-hugo%E7%9A%84%E6%A8%A1%E5%9D%97-8ef5a520a822&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;07. Hugo Architecture — Hugo Modules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugos-modularization&#34;&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Modularization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git submodule&lt;/code&gt; still works, but we don’t recommend using it. Maintaining them can be quite troublesome if the themes used are updated; they should be managed as separate Git repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theme-modification-logichttpsstackjimmycaicomguidemodify-theme&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stack.jimmycai.com/guide/modify-theme&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Theme Modification Logic&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve grasped the foundational concepts of modularization, understanding custom themes becomes much simpler. Hugo themes are currently assembled from multiple different modules. To modify a single module, locate its corresponding template file and make the changes directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpted from the official &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this method, there will be no files under the &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; directory.  To modify the theme, you will need to copy the file you want to modify to the same directory under the &lt;code&gt;layouts&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theme-modification-logichttpsstackjimmycaicomguidemodify-theme-1&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stack.jimmycai.com/guide/modify-theme&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Theme Modification Logic&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in order to modify the &lt;code&gt;themes/hugo-theme-stack/layouts/partials/head/custom.html&lt;/code&gt; file, you will need to copy it to &lt;code&gt;layouts/partials/head/custom.html&lt;/code&gt; and modify it there (copy the code from the theme&amp;rsquo;s repository). The same applies to the &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; directories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review the source files of the topic, understand its design rationale, identify the corresponding template file, and modify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bruteforce-approach&#34;&gt;Bruteforce Approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I don’t have a deep understanding of frontend code, sometimes I resort to a brute-force approach, such as opening the corresponding page directly in the browser, finding the areas I want to modify, and using “Inspect Element” to pinpoint the &lt;code&gt;css name&lt;/code&gt;, then searching the source code for the relevant file, copying it into the site directory, and making changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips&#34;&gt;Tips
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official setup provides a default file for customizing styles. To modify specific areas, we can split them into multiple files and import them using &lt;code&gt;custom.scss&lt;/code&gt;. This approach allows for better management of style files.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall: Global text style, adopting the previous display style that merged &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;info cn&lt;/code&gt;, which is friendly to Chinese&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homepage: Added mouse interaction animation to the right navigation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homepage: New article summaries are added (a time-consuming task, achieved using a clever workaround)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scroll Bar: Improved the styling of the scroll bar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code Blocks: Introduced &lt;code&gt;highlight.&lt;/code&gt;. - JavaScript code highlighting plugin, beautify code block styles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article details: Some content is a reprint, with new original author information display and original link display&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archived page: Added a statistical display panel for classification by year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archived page: Two-column layout display ## Summarize Modified Content (6h)
It’s now the first year of AI coding, and the detailed content will not be pasted here for brevity; instead, we simply list some of the modifications made to this site, such as adjusting the copy button styles, reconfiguring the code block styles, and ChatGPT can be easily handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall: Global text style, adopting the display style previously used by merging &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;info cn&lt;/code&gt;, which is friendly to Chinese&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homepage: Added mouse interaction animation to the right navigation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homepage: New article added summary preview (took quite a while, implemented using a clever trick)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scroll Bar: Beautified the scroll bar’s styling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code Blocks: Introduced &lt;code&gt;highlight.&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summarize-modified-content-6h-1&#34;&gt;Summarize Modified Content (6h)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; theme component reuse rate is very high, which has led to a significant amount of time being spent adding summary previews to new homepage articles.  I modified the corresponding component, and this resulted in changes to the article’s detail page, leading to redundant display of the main content. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very familiar with &lt;code&gt;golang templates&lt;/code&gt;, so it took up a lot of time.  I struggled to get parameters passed between components, and ultimately resolved this by taking a shortcut: introducing a &lt;code&gt;JavaScript&lt;/code&gt; script independently on the homepage and using custom special variables to implement the summary preview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes high component reuse rates can also be a problem, leading to changes in one place affecting other places. Therefore, when modifying themes, you must pay attention not to disrupt existing logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;comments&#34;&gt;Comments

&lt;del&gt;This site simply enabled the &lt;code&gt;Waline&lt;/code&gt; comment system, as the &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt; theme defaults to supporting &lt;code&gt;Waline&lt;/code&gt;. Just configure it in the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Town Brahmin: The “Big Man” of Small Places</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:02:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, the popular &amp;ldquo;Da Bing&amp;rdquo; (Big Ice) on Douyin (TikTok) has been frequently seen with short video accounts extracted from her live streams. A listener who joined a live call asked: “Da Bing, I want to sell my house in Xi&amp;rsquo;an and return home to settle down.” Da Bing responded: “At your age, you’re in your early thirties; you can’t settle down. Your parents are on the path of aging, your children haven’t started a family or established themselves, and if you return home, you’ll still need to deal with the ‘parameshik’ (婆罗门) in the small county.”
Let&amp;rsquo;s put aside whether the viewpoint is right or wrong, what does the term “parameshik” (婆罗门) mean?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;township-brahmins-the-big-shots-of-small-places&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Township Brahmins: The “Big Shots” of Small Places&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many small county towns, people often talk about so-called &amp;ldquo;township brahmins&amp;rdquo;—the existence of these individuals seems to be a symbol of local society. They are not necessarily genuine religious figures and do not possess “high-level” titles; rather, they are seemingly ordinary but nonetheless influential people. They represent “power, status, and influence” within that county town, symbolizing a particular class or stratum in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-xiancheng-babao&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an “Xiancheng Babao?”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand that “Babao” originally referred to the highest caste in Indian society, representing wisdom, authority, and spiritual supremacy. In China’s county towns, the term “Xiancheng Babao” doesn&amp;rsquo;t have such a complex religious background; it’s more of a metaphor for a social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, an “Xiancheng Babao” can be understood as some “cultural authorities” within the county town – such as teachers, doctors, well-known merchants, and officials, etc. Although their positions may seem ordinary, in this relatively closed environment, they possessed a comparatively higher social status, or their opinions and actions had influence that could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-the-county-town-brahmin&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is the &amp;ldquo;County Town Brahmin&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a county town, there are almost always these “Brahmins” – individuals who hold influence in virtually every industry. They might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educators:&lt;/strong&gt; Particularly teachers with decades of experience locally, who may not have graduated from prestigious universities but understand how to establish credibility through knowledge and are widely respected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Government Officials:&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy county magistrates, section chiefs, etc., who control certain resources and power, even if their positions aren&amp;rsquo;t high-ranking; their limited scope of authority can make them local “Brahmins.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local &amp;ldquo;Entrepreneurs&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/strong&gt; Some business owners in county towns, although not large in scale, hold a certain amount of wealth and have a voice in the region. They might operate one or two well-known local small businesses and wield considerable influence within the county town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-status-of-county-town-brahmins--how-does-it-impact-society&#34;&gt;The Status of “County Town Brahmins” – How Does it Impact Society?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the significance of “county town brahmins,” we must consider the unique environment of the county town. Here, information flow is slower than in large cities, and social mobility is relatively fixed. These “brahmins” often accumulated prestige, knowledge, and connections through long-term dedication to the local area. They influence various aspects of local politics, economics, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; In small places, especially where education systems may not be as developed and people have limited choices, local &amp;ldquo;brahmins&amp;rdquo; subtly shape the cultural atmosphere through knowledge transmission in classrooms, explanations in media, and even moral guidance in social settings. &lt;strong&gt;Concentration of Social Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the limited population and resources in county-level cities, these “Brahman” figures were often one of the primary controllers of local resources. Whether it was social welfare, policy implementation, or the approval of certain projects, they invariably exerted influence. Their power of speech and decision-making allowed them to hold a significant position within the local society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Networked Structure of Interpersonal Relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; In a relatively closed small community, interpersonal relationships are often crucial. These “county Brahman” figures established powerful social networks to control information flow and resource allocation, thereby playing a decisive role at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-metaphor-of-the-county-sharma&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Metaphor of the “County Sharma”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the “county sharma” (often translated as &amp;ldquo;town Brahmin&amp;rdquo;) is frequently regarded with respect and admiration, this position of elevated status isn’t without its issues. In modern society, it&amp;rsquo;s not difficult to observe that many county-level “sharmas” lack genuine ability and innovative spirit; instead, they maintain their positions through hereditary relationships and resource monopolies. With the development of informatization, these “sharmas’” power is gradually being broken down, and new social mobility is beginning to influence the appearance of small counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the “county sharma” is a fascinating social phenomenon that reflects the power and cultural structures within local societies. Although their “power” may not directly threaten national governance, they are undoubtedly key figures within the locality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this would have happened if we hadn’t started with curiosity about what a ‘purohito’ was, then tossed it to ‘kimi’. The result was surprisingly funny – I could see the web interface already pulling up search results, but instantly they were blocked from displaying related content. Then I wondered, did this word hold some special significance? So I passed it on to ‘ChatGPT’, and that&amp;rsquo;s how this article came about.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linux backend services handling large volumes of string data – performance is slow.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-backend-slow-string-processing/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:42:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-backend-slow-string-processing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the history of C++ development projects, we utilized a custom protocol for communication, which employed a two-dimensional array pattern. When processing large volumes of data, the protocol required iterating through the arrays and performing serialization operations to generate logs. Due to its low efficiency, this resulted in noticeable lag or stuttering within the system under heavy load, as reported by the business departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-identification&#34;&gt;Problem Identification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When troubleshooting the issue, we first performed a performance analysis of the system and found that CPU utilization increased significantly when processing large amounts of data, and system response times became longer. Through analyzing the system logs, we identified numerous serialization operations, which were inefficient when handling two-dimensional arrays, leading to a decline in system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool captured thread information for the service, pinpointing that the log threads spent most of their time processing string concatenation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is today&amp;rsquo;s focus: different accumulation methods have significant efficiency differences. Historically, the code used the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator, which frequently creates temporary objects and is very inefficient. You know it’s bad, but you don’t know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; bad it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;demo-verification&#34;&gt;Demo Verification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the project code, we extracted the business logic and wrote a simple demo to verify the efficiency issues of string concatenation. We compiled and ran it in &lt;code&gt;Release&lt;/code&gt; mode using the &lt;code&gt;vs2022&lt;/code&gt; compiler under &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;gcc8.5&lt;/code&gt; compiler under &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt;, comparing the efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-points-explanation&#34;&gt;Key Points Explanation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project utilized Method Four, and before obtaining test data, the reader should consider which method is most efficient and which is least efficient. I was quite surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 1 (&lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; Concatenation)&lt;/strong&gt;: Directly concatenates each field using &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; to a string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 2 (&lt;code&gt;std::ostringstream&lt;/code&gt; Concatenation)&lt;/strong&gt;: Uses a stream (&lt;code&gt;std::ostringstream&lt;/code&gt;) to concatenate fields, which is more efficient, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 3 (Pre-allocated &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; Concatenation)&lt;/strong&gt;: Pre-allocates enough memory for the string using &lt;code&gt;reserve&lt;/code&gt; to reduce the overhead of memory reallocation and improve performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 4 (&lt;code&gt;bodys = bodys + body + &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;: Each concatenation creates a new temporary string object, leading to performance degradation, especially with large-scale concatenations due to the allocation and copying of a new memory space each time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to the results, we can see that this method was selected as the least efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the optimization efficiency of different platform compilers – Microsoft’s &lt;code&gt;visual studio&lt;/code&gt; remains consistently excellent, with high string optimization efficiency, while the &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; compiler lags somewhat in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-points-explanation-1&#34;&gt;Key Points Explanation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code executes on different machines, and the two datasets do not have a direct comparison; instead, differences can be compared between various splicing methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>C&#43;&#43; Lambda Expression Parameter Lifetimes</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-lambda-parameter-lifetime/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:23:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-lambda-parameter-lifetime/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In C++, lambda expressions are a convenient way to create anonymous functions that can capture external variables and use them within their bodies. This makes lambdas a flexible programming tool. However, the lifetime of parameters in a lambda expression is an aspect that requires careful attention, especially when capturing and passing parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-lambda-expression-parameter-lifetime&#34;&gt;1. Lambda Expression Parameter Lifetime
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lifetime of parameters in a lambda expression is typically the same as that of other C++ functions. Parameters exist while the function is being called, and their lifetime ends when the function call terminates. However, due to the possibility of lambdas capturing external variables, the parameter&amp;rsquo;s lifetime is also affected by how it’s captured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-capturing-the-relationship-with-parameter-lifecycles&#34;&gt;2. Capturing the Relationship with Parameter Lifecycles
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;#### 2.1 Capturing External Variables

C++ lambda expressions allow external variables to be captured in two ways:

- **Capture by Value:** When capturing by value, the value of the external variable is copied into the lambda, and the lifetime of the copy is controlled by the lifetime of the lambda.
- **Capture by Reference:** When capturing by reference, a reference to the external variable is retained, and the lambda&#39;s reference points to the original external variable. The lifetime depends on the external variable.

For captured variables, the lifetimes are as follows:

- **Capture by Value:** When capturing, the value of the external variable is copied into the lambda; when the lambda’s lifetime ends, the copy is destroyed.
- **Capture by Reference:** The lambda holds a reference to the external variable, and **the external variable must be valid before it is used within the lambda, otherwise undefined behavior results.**
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;22-lambda-parameters&#34;&gt;2.2 Lambda Parameters
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lambda parameters are similar to regular function parameters; their lifetime is limited to the lambda function body. That is, lambda parameters are created when the lambda is called and their lifetime ends when the lambda call completes.
In this example, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are the parameters of the lambda expression, they are created when the lambda is called and destroyed when the lambda executes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-lifecycle-issues-when-capturing-external-variables&#34;&gt;3. Lifecycle Issues When Capturing External Variables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;31-whether-captured-variables-are-valid-outside-lambda&#34;&gt;3.1 Whether Captured Variables Are Valid Outside Lambda
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value Capture:&lt;/strong&gt; Even if the external variable is destroyed after the lambda call, the lambda internally holds a copy of the external variable. Therefore, the copy within the lambda can be safely used even if the external variable no longer exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference Capture:&lt;/strong&gt; If the captured variable is a reference to the external variable, the lambda&amp;rsquo;s access to that reference depends on the lifecycle of the external variable. If the external variable is destroyed before the lambda executes, a dangling reference issue will occur, leading to undefined behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to ensure that the external variables are valid when the lambda executes if the execution order of the lambda is not deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Win11 Logitech G431 Headset Driver Installation</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 07:20:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Picking up where we left off, I discovered that GitHub had an update, which was a little exciting. The customer service representative said the issue with the driver not loading properly was resolved. However, after going through all the troubleshooting – reinstalling and uninstalling – it still wasn&amp;rsquo;t working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing to contact customer service to inquire about a resolution, I was informed that an engineer could provide remote assistance. However, the engineer’s working hours coincided exactly with my own, leaving me with no option but to abandon the effort. Reviewing the documentation from the previous troubleshooting issue, I decided to attempt a manual driver installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obtaining-driver-installation-packages&#34;&gt;Obtaining Driver Installation Packages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logitech does not provide separate driver installation packages for devices. How can I obtain the driver files?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with the system image package left over from the previous system reinstallation, we can reinstall the system once in a local virtual machine, and then deploy a clean copy of Ghub in the pure system, inserting the headset device into the virtual machine to find the driver path and copy it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevant paths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\ProgramData\LGHUB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\logi_audio.inf_amd64_010b035044e24be4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;device-manager&#34;&gt;Device Manager
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus is on how to find the second path – let’s first briefly outline how to manually manage driver files in a Windows 11 system. This content &lt;strong&gt;is identified using the method of controlling variables by repeatedly plugging and unplugging devices, analyzing device information within Device Manager inside a virtual machine, and identifying three drivers that need to be handled for headphones.&lt;/strong&gt; Two of these drivers are system-provided, while one is provided by Logitech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/20240605073331.png&#34;
	width=&#34;433&#34;
	height=&#34;904&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Driver Manager&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;47&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;114px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second driver shown in the image, it’s provided by Logitech.  Let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the current driver program for the device and then search all driver paths within the virtual machine. Of course, you first need to find files starting with “logi,” and then compare the files – this will allow you to pinpoint the location of the driver folder, copy the entire folder, and you’ll have the driver installation package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-the-driver&#34;&gt;Installing the Driver
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the device manager interface, click: Update driver, then click: Browse my computer to find drivers, and you’ll arrive at the following interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, when you open it, you&amp;rsquo;ll only see one driver – the standard USB driver. Select &amp;ldquo;Install from disk&amp;rdquo; and the path is the folder we copied earlier. After installation, you’ll be able to add Logitech-specific drivers in the dropdown list. Switch the device driver to the newly installed driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These driver files are provided by the system. You only need to check if there is an exclamation mark preceding the device driver name. If there is, enter the Driver Selection interface, randomly switch to a different type of driver, and then revert it back to restore normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;completed&#34;&gt;Completed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headphone microphone volume has been restored to normal, and the familiar in-ear functionality has returned.

        <title>Logitech Headset Driver Installation Failed</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you completely don&amp;rsquo;t understand these things, contacting official customer service first will also avoid wasting several hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the C drive of my desktop computer used for development was running out of space, so I took out a 256GB semi-retired solid state hard drive to use as the C drive. Unfortunately, I kept messing around with it. Since moving to Shanghai, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with various things, and last week I finally had time to reinstall the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system reinstallation went smoothly, and installing daily software and deploying development environments didn’t encounter any problems. A few days later, I planned to relax and play a few games when I realized that the drivers for my mouse and headphones hadn&amp;rsquo;t been installed. Both devices are Logitech products, so I downloaded the GHUB software, which can automatically identify hardware and install drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an unexpected event occurred. The mouse driver installed successfully, but the headphone driver kept displaying &amp;ldquo;Loading&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I suspect it may be incompatibility between the latest version of Windows 11 and Logitech’s drivers, causing the installation to fail. Therefore, I began searching for information and attempting manual driver installations, but the problem persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me briefly explain the roles of these two drivers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mouse driver primarily focuses on adjusting mouse movement speed and other functions. I rarely use macros; I simply restore previously remembered parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The headphone driver mainly handles the microphone functionality (earphone mic), which is very useful during team voice calls, allowing me to hear my own voice. Although there’s a similar listening function in the system&amp;rsquo;s microphone settings, it doesn’t perform as well as the driver implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text-1&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite my repeated attempts, the headset driver consistently failed to load properly. Today, I finally thought of reaching out to customer service to inquire about the situation and see if there were any solutions. Customer service informed me that their servers had recently experienced an issue, leading to abnormal driver downloads. They are currently addressing this problem and asked me not to worry; the issue should be resolved after the next update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the headset driver issue hasn’t been resolved yet, at least I now know the cause, and I hope the problem can be fixed as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Public Housing Fund (Prudential Loan) Interest Rate Will Be Reduced by 0.25% Starting Tomorrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First-Time Homebuyers Down Payment Ratio Reduced to 15%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;300 Billion Yuan in Guaranteed Affordable Housing Repurchase Loans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cancellation-of-national-level-first-and-second-time-home-purchase-mortgage-interest-rate-policy-lower-bounds&#34;&gt;Cancellation of National-Level First and Second-Time Home Purchase Mortgage Interest Rate Policy Lower Bounds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, Shanghai Headquarters, branches of the provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and planned cities; state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and all joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to implement the decision-making deployment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, adapt to the new supply and demand relationship in China’s real estate market and the new expectations of the people for high-quality housing, and promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, the following matters regarding adjustments to commercial personal mortgage interest rate policies are hereby notified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancellation of the lower bound on interest rates for commercial personal mortgages for first-time and second-time home purchases at the national level. Here’s the English translation of the provided text:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“II. The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China (PBOC) branches at provincial levels, in accordance with the policy of ‘fine-tuning,’ guide provincial interest rate pricing self-regulatory mechanisms, based on the market conditions and regulatory requirements of each city within their jurisdiction. Financial institutions autonomously determine whether to set lower limits for commercial personal housing loan rates and levels within those limits (if applicable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;III. Banks and financial institutions should, in accordance with the interest rate limits established by provincial market interest rate pricing self-regulatory mechanisms (if any), rationally determine the specific interest rate level for each loan, taking into account the institution’s operating conditions and customer risk profiles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-personal-housing-mortgage-loan-interest-rates-by-025-percentage-points&#34;&gt;Reducing Personal Housing Mortgage Loan Interest Rates by 0.25 Percentage Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, Shanghai Headquarters, branches of the People’s Bank of China in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and planned special-purpose cities; policy banks, state commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People’s Bank of China has decided to reduce personal housing mortgage loan interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, effective May 18, 2024. The interest rates for first-time and second-home personal housing mortgage loans with a term of less than 5 years (including 5 years) will be adjusted to 2.35% and 2.85%, respectively.  The interest rates for first-time and second-home personal housing mortgage loans with a term of less than 5 years (including 5 years) will also be no lower than 2.775% and 3.325%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;down-payment-ratio-adjusted-to-no-less-than-15&#34;&gt;Down Payment Ratio Adjusted to No Less Than 15%
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, Shanghai Headquarters, branches of the People’s Bank of China in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and planned unitary cities; the Regulatory Bureau of the National Financial Supervision and Administration; all state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and all joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement the decision-making deployment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, to adapt to the new supply and demand relationship in China’s real estate market and the new expectations of people for high-quality housing, and to promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, the following notification is issued regarding matters related to personal mortgage loans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For residential households purchasing commercial personal mortgages for primary residences, the minimum down payment ratio for primary residence mortgages has been adjusted to no less than 15%, while the minimum down payment ratio for secondary residence commercial personal mortgages has been adjusted to no less than 25%. Based on this, the branches of the People’s Bank of China and various affiliated institutions of the National Financial Supervision and Administration Commission, according to the housing control requirements set by local governments, and adhering to a principle of “fine-tuning based on local conditions,” independently determine the minimum lower limits for commercial personal housing loans for first-time and second-time homebuyers in each respective city within their jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-central-bank-will-establish-a-30-billion-yuan-guarantee-housing-refinancing-loan&#34;&gt;The Central Bank Will Establish a 30 Billion Yuan Guarantee Housing Refinancing Loan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 4:00 PM, representatives from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the People’s Bank of China, and the National Financial Supervision and Administration Commission gathered at a routine policy briefing by the State Council to introduce measures to effectively ensure contract fulfillment (保交房).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Vice Governor Tao Ling announced that the central bank will establish a 30 billion yuan guarantee housing refinancing loan to support local state-owned enterprises in purchasing completed but unsold commercial properties at reasonable prices for use as self-built or rental-based affordable housing. This is expected to drive bank loans by 50 billion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the People’s Bank of China, the guarantee housing refinancing loan term can be extended up to four times annually with a rate of 1.75%, aimed at 21 nationwide banks. It incentivizes banks to lend to local state-owned enterprises selected by city governments to purchase completed but unsold commercial properties for use as affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Balancing Bank Marketing Strategies with the Art of Personal Financial Management</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 01:33:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the renovation project at home has led to a surge in daily expenses. I’ve also been using credit cards, paying them off within the billing cycle, although I have sufficient cash on hand, I prefer to keep it in money funds to earn some additional interest income. Furthermore, to ensure financial stability, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up automatic payment functionality so that my credit card bills can be paid promptly upon maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-status-deposits-increase-loans-decrease&#34;&gt;Bank Status: Deposits Increase, Loans Decrease
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst increasing economic uncertainty, people are more inclined to save rather than consume or invest. This has led to an increase in bank deposits, but it also means banks have to pay higher interest rates to depositors. Conversely, due to reduced consumer and investment activity, loan demand has decreased, making it difficult for banks to generate interest income through lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attract and retain customers, banks are forced to offer more competitive deposit rates, further compressing the bank’s net interest margin. Simultaneously, in order to stimulate economic growth and consumption, central banks may implement policies of lowering benchmark interest rates, which will also impact bank loan rates and consequently affect their profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;banking-marketing-strategies-cultivating-user-habits&#34;&gt;Banking Marketing Strategies: Cultivating User Habits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The due date was approaching quickly. First, the Bank of Communications contacted me, offering a one-year free installment service with no interest charges. Shortly after, China Merchants Bank also provided a 2.5% discount on installment interest rates, which translated to an annualized rate of 1.9%. Faced with these offers, I chose to accept installment services from both banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that banks truly go all out to cultivate user habits. According to the bank’s definition of “flow,” I should be a premium customer. In the current context of difficulty for banks in lending and deploying funds, by cultivating my installment awareness, the bank is actually preparing for potential future liquidity difficulties from me, at which point they can earn more interest income from me. After all, as we know, interest rates on credit card bill analysis are not low. Banks, by offering free installment services and low-interest installment promotions, not only increased the frequency and limits of credit card usage but also established a positive image in the minds of users. This shift in strategy reflects the bank’s rapid response to market changes and its deep understanding of customer needs. In this way, the bank not only solved the problem of difficulty in lending funds but also laid the groundwork for future profits – &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s not just about making money today; looking ahead is key to long-term sustainability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-personal-financial-management&#34;&gt;The Importance of Personal Financial Management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the appealing offers of installment financing from banks, as users, we should recognize the risks associated with over-reliance on credit card installments. We should carefully consider our repayment ability and future financial needs to avoid falling into long-term debt traps due to short-term financial convenience. Key to personal financial management is balancing current needs with future planning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The multifaceted nature of gaming: the intersection of psychological development and social entertainment.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 15:07:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s digital age, games have evolved far beyond a simple form of entertainment and become an integral part of people&amp;rsquo;s daily lives. From a psychological perspective, games play different roles in the mental development of individuals across various age groups, while also being closely intertwined with social and recreational activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-state&#34;&gt;Mental State
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people are in the stage of exploring themselves and establishing their identity. &lt;strong&gt;Games provide them with a low-cost environment to try and explore.&lt;/strong&gt; Through games, they can experiment with different roles and lifestyles, satisfying their curiosity and desire for exploration. As they grow older, individuals’ interests and values gradually stabilize, and games may no longer align with their life goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes&#34;&gt;Social Attributes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the game has also become a part of social activities, particularly for young people. They make friends and build social networks through games, making games a bridge for socialization. However, as people age, their social circles gradually stabilize, and social needs may be met through more mature ways, leading to a relative reduction in the role of games in socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes-bringing-a-sister-with-a-female-player&#34;&gt;Social Attributes: Bringing a Sister (with a female player)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within China, due to a lack of adequate dating education, parents often simply expect you to study well and then immediately want you to start a relationship after graduation. This phenomenon is very common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of busy studies, work, or a lack of social skills, individuals are unable to establish stable emotional relationships in real life, leading to feelings of loneliness and a desire for attention. &lt;strong&gt;The “bringing a sister” behavior within games provides an outlet to release this craving.&lt;/strong&gt; By helping and protecting female players, they can experience being needed and valued, gaining emotional satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the interactive rules within games are clearly defined, and the environment is controllable, offering a sense of certainty and security compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real life, reducing fears associated with the unpredictability of real-world interactions. ## Social Attributes: Bringing a Sister (with a female player)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within China, due to a lack of adequate dating education, parents often only taught you to study diligently and then immediately expected you to start a relationship after graduation. This phenomenon is quite common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the interactive rules within games are clearly defined, and the environment is controllable, offering a sense of certainty and security compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real-life interactions, reducing fear of the uncertainties in real-world relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-world-pressure&#34;&gt;Real-World Pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games provide a virtual world where players can temporarily escape the pressures, challenges, or unpleasant emotions of real life. Particularly for young people facing academic pressure, family issues, or interpersonal relationship challenges, games may become a way to seek comfort and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are typically designed to give players a sense of accomplishment and recognition when completing tasks, leveling up, or defeating opponents. Young people may become addicted to games because they can experience a feeling of being appreciated and recognized within them – a feeling that may be lacking in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dislike-playing-after-getting-older&#34;&gt;Dislike Playing After Getting Older
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young, individuals face relatively fewer social responsibilities and pressures, allowing them more time and energy to invest in gaming. As they enter the workforce or start families and other social responsibilities increase, time and energy become more valuable, and games may be seen as a time drain rather than a preferred leisure activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, their cognitive abilities and interests also change. They might have been interested in fast-paced, visually stunning games when younger, but with increased experience, they may prefer strategy games, those with strong storylines, or more complex and immersive experiences. If the market doesn’t meet these changing needs, interest naturally declines.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Renminbi exchange rate has experienced significant fluctuations, breaking above 7.26.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/renminbi-exchange-rate-volatility/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 00:31:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/renminbi-exchange-rate-volatility/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Renminbi and a decline in the Shanghai Composite Index may be related to developments at global central banks, the unexpected interest rate cut by the Swiss National Bank, performance of U.S. economic data, and adjustments in market expectations regarding inflation and interest rate cuts. These factors interact together in the foreign exchange market and stock market, leading to volatility in the Renminbi and a decline in A-shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the provided link content, on March 22, 2024, the Renminbi experienced significant fluctuations. Here&amp;rsquo;s the detailed information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dollar Exchange Rate against Offshore Renminbi Breaks Through:&lt;/strong&gt; At the opening of trading, the Renminbi weakened, with the dollar exchanging against offshore Renminbi rising to a high of 7.24926 and 7.22360 respectively, both breaking new highs since November 17, 2023. As of the time of reporter release by Lianhe Finance, the dollar against offshore Renminbi broke through the 7.26 level, reporting a low of 7.2639, and the trend remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central Bank Mid-Price Adjustment:&lt;/strong&gt; On March 22nd, the central bank announced the RMB/USD midpoint quotation at 7.1004, a depreciation of 62 basis points, expanding the adjustment magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A-Share Market Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; Affected by various factors, the three major A-share indices opened lower and continued to decline, with declines exceeding 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causes of Volatility in the Forex Market:&lt;/strong&gt; A senior foreign exchange trader from a Hong Kong investment firm stated that volatility in the forex market was primarily due to the Swiss National Bank unexpectedly cutting interest rates, which boosted the dollar, coupled with strong US economic growth and the potential for inflationary persistence delaying interest rate cuts, leading to an increase in the Dollar Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Central Bank Dynamics&lt;/strong&gt;: This week is a “super central bank week” for global markets, with the U.S., Japan, UK, Australia, and other countries’ central banks all announcing interest rate decisions this week. The Swiss National Bank unexpectedly cut rates, becoming the first G10 currency central bank to cut rates since the outbreak of the pandemic, breaking market equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RMB Trend Forecast&lt;/strong&gt;: Guotai Securities Financial Markets Department Researcher Zhou Maohua stated that despite recent fluctuations in the RMB, the overall amplitude is significantly smaller than that of the U.S. dollar and other major currencies. Short-term volatility will not change the RMB’s steady uptrend this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Python programming, a dictionary is a very powerful data structure that allows us to associate key-value pairs and efficiently search and manipulate these data. When we try to store custom objects in a dictionary, we often encounter a key concept: In Python, object assignment is actually reference assignment, not a deep copy of the object itself. This means that when you put a custom object into a dictionary, the dictionary stores a reference to that object, rather than a brand new copy of the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-example-of-storing-custom-objects&#34;&gt;Basic Example of Storing Custom Objects
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume we have a simple &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; class:
In this example, the &lt;code&gt;people_dict&lt;/code&gt; dictionary now contains an item with a key &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;alice&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; whose value is a reference to a &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; type object named &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt;. If we modify the attributes of &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt;:
Then when accessing this object through the dictionary, we find that its age has also been updated:
This is because the dictionary does not store independent copies of the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; objects, but rather references pointing to the same memory address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deep-copy-vs-shallow-copy&#34;&gt;Deep Copy vs. Shallow Copy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This referencing behavior can lead to unexpected results when dealing with nested data structures or custom objects. For example, if a custom object contains mutable attributes (such as lists or another custom object), directly storing such an object in a dictionary and modifying it will affect the object obtained through the dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution: Deep Copy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid problems caused by shared state, sometimes we need to ensure that the dictionary stores a complete copy of the object, rather than a reference. Python provides the &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; module&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; function to achieve this goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, when using dictionaries in Python to store custom objects, be sure to note that by default they store object references.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starch noodles and roadside stalls: The new influence of capital’s news.</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;315 actually did not report on “chicken mud,” and this issue itself has been confusing the official exposure of CCTV’s 3·15 Evening Gala with other food safety hotspots that occurred concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zhihu-answer-journalismhttpswwwzhihucomquestion648967411answer3433834122&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zhihu.com/question/648967411/answer/3433834122&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zhihu Answer: Journalism&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;315 Evening Party presented nine manufacturers in total, none of which included potato starch intestines. Now those nominated major brands have completely lost heat, and the potato starch intestines – a national-level snack (basically found on almost every street food stall across the country with a large number of stalls – is brought out to speak, making it feel like the potato starch intestines are being scapegoated entirely. I looked at online news sources, including CCTV News&amp;hellip; - On the 15th, a news article was published about investigations into ham sausage. It simply listed the ingredients of several manufacturers, and many of these companies weren&amp;rsquo;t primarily producers of starch sausage. There were no obvious issues with the ingredients themselves. Then, a reporter obtained information from a factory employee who said that sometimes chicken bone meal was used instead of chicken meat – something that had been rumored. She then went to pet food stores on Taobao to ask if it was safe for humans to eat chicken bone meal, which is essentially a ridiculous question! Isn&amp;rsquo;t this a stupid issue? A pet food company wouldn’t dare tell you it’s okay for people to eat it. Subsequently, rumors spread that all starch sausage contained chicken bone meal, and chicken bone meal is harmful to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently, it appears many factories are likely to be shut down, and tens of thousands of small vendors across the country face the situation of having products they can&amp;rsquo;t sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-life&#34;&gt;Real Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Xiaoxiang Morning News on March 17th, the day after the “starchy sausage collapse” incident in Sanmenxia, Henan, a grandmother set up a stall selling starchy sausages two days later, but after two hours, she still didn’t attract any customers and ultimately ate the sausages herself. The photographer said that he himself could eat four or five starchy sausages at once, but after learning that the starchy sausages contained chicken bone mud, he refused to eat them. That day, he was curious whether anyone would still buy the sausages after they were exposed, and he saw that the vendor didn’t sell a single sausage in two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aunt didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about the starchy sausage incident; she only knew that suddenly no one was buying her grilled sausages that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grandmother was right; she was just trying to make a living, and the grandmother didn’t even know if the product had any problems or whether it was qualified, nor did she know what bone mud was. She didn&amp;rsquo;t know about the internet; she was simply a bottom-level person finding ways to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zhihu-answer-regulatory-restrictionshttpswwwzhihucomquestion648967411answer3433978475&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zhihu.com/question/648967411/answer/3433978475&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zhihu Answer: Regulatory Restrictions&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, on an afternoon, my colleague who had migrated to Beijing and back (北漂 - Běi Piao) and I went out for lunch. We passed by a small stall selling grilled sausages and sizzling beef strips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I casually said, “With all this black technology starch sausage and beef strips around, will people even still eat them?” Because in my view, the last time I ate starch-based ham sausage was probably about fifteen years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague hesitated and then tactfully said, &amp;ldquo;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because you live in a big city. In our hometown, small places, pickled cabbage, instant noodles, and ham sausage are just everyday staples.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I was in school, my dad would only let me have a grilled sausage on the way home if I got full marks on an exam. It wasn’t because they weren&amp;rsquo;t hygienic; it was simply that a sausage cost 1.5 yuan, which could buy two pounds of green vegetables.” “The way people casually refer to instant noodles, carbonated drinks, and spicy snacks as ‘junk food’ – I only heard about that after moving to Beijing for school.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized my previous careless words were arrogant and fell silent. But this incident left a strong impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this is the everyday life of most Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lives don&amp;rsquo;t include fancy things like the “Mediterranean diet,” “green organic vegetables,” or “non-GMO soybeans.” They simply care about whether they can afford some cheap and tasty vegetables, meat, and snacks, and enjoy the few moments of happiness their family has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They scrutinize the ingredients of what’s on the shelves – what they&amp;rsquo;re made of, whether they might harm their health, and if they contain any strange chemical components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s simply not something they should be concerned with or understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zhihu-answer-regulatory-issueshttpswwwzhihucomquestion648967411answer3433978475&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zhihu.com/question/648967411/answer/3433978475&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zhihu Answer: Regulatory Issues&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after watching a 315 event, we realized it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case.
Electronic scales and gasoline pumps at gas stations are being secretly modified with high-tech mainboards, requiring content creators to take risks filming videos that could lead to beatings, so regulators can “suddenly realize” and investigate and punish;
&lt;strong&gt;The pork dishes in live streams and starchy tubes from small stalls were actually made with rotten meat and bone meal. It required CCTV reporters to go undercover and film the evidence, which then prompted verification and investigation into the source of the goods.&lt;/strong&gt;
“Health wines” widely promoted on television channels and airport advertisements would only be urgently removed and disappear before consumers if someone filmed and exposed their entire operation.
The annual 315 event always removes five or six products that have been sold for a long time – is that enough?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Want your home network to be lightning fast? The key is understanding cable selection, optical terminals (ONTs), and router configuration, as well as those seemingly insignificant details. This blog post will guide you through easily learning how to build a gigabit network using six types of cables, and how to ensure your network speed isn&amp;rsquo;t restricted by simple device checks and configurations. Let’s explore together and make your home network fly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-an-in-depth-analysis-of-network-transmission-media&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: An In-Depth Analysis of Network Transmission Media
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When discussing achieving gigabit network access, the carrier that supports high-speed information transmission – cables – plays a crucial role. Below we will provide detailed interpretations of Cat5, Cat6, and Cat7 cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-five-category-cables-cat5&#34;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Five-Category Cables (CAT5)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAT5 cables, also known as CAT5, are an earlier and more widely adopted type of twisted pair cable. Each pair of wire pairs is designed with a precise helical structure to reduce crosstalk. It’s primarily used for 10/100Mbps Fast Ethernet, with a maximum transmission frequency of approximately 100MHz. While it was once widely applied, CAT5 cables cannot meet current demands for gigabit and even higher speeds due to physical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-six-category-cables-cat6&#34;&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Six-Category Cables (CAT6)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the development of technology, six-category cables have emerged. Compared to five-category cables, six-cable materials adopted stricter manufacturing standards and more advanced structural designs, significantly improving anti-interference capability and transmission efficiency, supporting data transfer rates up to 1Gbps, and with a transmission distance of up to 100 meters under ideal conditions, which perfectly meets the access requirements of Gigabit networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-seven-category-cables-cat7&#34;&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Seven-Category Cables (CAT7)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven-category cables represent the current cutting edge of twisted pair cabling technology. It not only offers a significant leap in transmission rates, theoretically supporting speeds up to 10Gbps, but also incorporates a complete shielding system, including shielding between each pair and overall external shielding, which greatly reduces external electromagnetic interference and near-end crosstalk, ensuring data transmission stability and accuracy. However, CAT7 cables are primarily used for future 10 Gigabit Ethernet or specific high-requirement scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When setting up a gigabit home network environment, choosing six-category cables is the most economical and efficient choice to fully unleash the potential of the gigabit fiber optic.  Furthermore, ensuring that all connection cables meet quality standards and strictly adhering to standard wiring practices are also important aspects in guaranteeing network performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-two-deep-dive-into-core-network-devices--the-impact-of-optical-cat-光猫-and-router-lan-port-bandwidth&#34;&gt;Chapter Two: Deep Dive into Core Network Devices – The Impact of Optical Cat (光猫) and Router LAN Port Bandwidth
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-importance-of-optical-cat-ont-and-its-lan-port-bandwidth&#34;&gt;The Importance of Optical Cat (ONT) and its LAN Port Bandwidth
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Optical Cat, or Optical Network Terminal (ONT), is the core device for home broadband access. Its function is to convert optical signals from fiber optic cables into digital signals for use by home network devices. For users with gigabit fiber connections, whether the ONT supports gigabit transmission is particularly important. If the ONT’s WAN port only supports 100 Mbps, even if the incoming fiber rate is high, it will be limited to 100 Mbps due to this bottleneck. Similarly, the ONT&amp;rsquo;s LAN port also needs to have a gigabit output capability; otherwise, routers or other devices connected to it cannot obtain the true gigabit rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-role-of-bandwidth-on-router-lan-ports&#34;&gt;The Role of Bandwidth on Router LAN Ports
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The router’s LAN ports are responsible for distributing the data received to various terminal devices. When a router&amp;rsquo;s LAN port is only 100 Mbps, even if other devices are configured well, it can only achieve 100 Mbps local network communication. Therefore, when building a Gigabit home network, it’s important to ensure that the router’s WAN port can receive 1 Gbps data and that the LAN ports also provide data output capabilities at the Gigabit level, so that all smart devices in your home can enjoy the smooth experience brought by high-speed networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that some older or low-end routers may have a LAN port automatic negotiation mechanism, which means that even if the router itself supports 1 Gbps, it may be downgraded to a 100 Mbps mode due to cable issues, device compatibility, and other reasons. Therefore, correctly configuring router parameters, enabling forced gigabit mode, and pairing it with a gigabit switch or direct device are key steps in achieving a full gigabit network. After upgrading to gigabit fiber, be sure to check and replace with gigabit optical switches and gigabit routers to ensure all device interfaces meet gigabit standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-three-the-hidden-mystery--how-a-broken-subline-impacts-gigabit-network-speed&#34;&gt;Chapter Three: The Hidden Mystery – How a Broken Subline Impacts Gigabit Network Speed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;line-fault-and-network-performance-degradation&#34;&gt;Line Fault and Network Performance Degradation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the speed tests, the network consistently maintained a connection without any apparent disconnects. As it was a newly deployed broadband for residential use, the distribution box was cluttered with equipment, and the technician frequently adjusted the optical transceiver and power outlet positions. This occasionally resulted in speed test results reaching gigabit speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the previous information, we had already analyzed and troubleshooted network cable types and optical transceiver LAN port speeds. Ultimately, the culprit was discovered to be a broken brown sub-cable within the network cable itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of the break: When the technician installed the crystal head, he applied a little too much force, causing one of the sub-cables to break in half. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t completely severed, and subsequent adjustments to the optical transceiver position caused it to eventually break completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;six-category-cable-lines-function-analysis&#34;&gt;Six Category Cable Lines Function Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six category cables adhere to the TIA/EIA-568-B standard and contain eight twisted pairs of wires, color-coded as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Orange / Orange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Green / Green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Blue / Blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Brown / Brown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-T) standard, these eight lines consist of four pairs working simultaneously, with the following division of labor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The White Orange and Orange pair of wires (1&amp;amp;2) is used for transmitting data (Tx+/-);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The White Green and Green pair of wires (3&amp;amp;6) is used for receiving data (Rx+/-);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The White Blue and Blue pair of wires (4&amp;amp;5) and the White Brown and Brown pair of wires (7&amp;amp;8) were not originally primary in Gigabit Ethernet, but may be enabled in certain advanced applications (such as some PoE power delivery or future technology expansions). In traditional 100 Mbps networks, only four lines – 1, 2, 3, and 6 – could be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;impact-of-breakaway-pairs-on-network-speed&#34;&gt;Impact of Breakaway Pairs on Network Speed
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above scenarios, if a brown sub-cable (i.e., brown or brown-white wire) breaks, theoretically it will cause speed degradation in gigabit networks, as gigabit networks require all four pairs of wires to transmit bidirectionally simultaneously to achieve full speed. However, due to home network devices often having auto-negotiation features, when a cable issue is detected, they will revert to a lower operating rate that functions normally, which is the megabit mode. This explains why even with a broken sub-cable, the network can remain connected and operate at megabit speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, while a broken brown sub-cable does not affect the basic operation of a megabit network, it can become a key limiting factor for network speed in gigabit environments. Until a thorough diagnosis and repair is conducted, the full potential of gigabit fiber cannot be truly realized. This also serves as a reminder that we should not overlook any potential network infrastructure issues when encountering similar situations – even seemingly minor connection glitches can become hidden obstacles to a high-speed networking experience.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WPF UI Thread Blocking Issues and Solutions</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wpf-ui-thread-and-freezing-issues-solutions/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 07:12:21 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wpf-ui-thread-and-freezing-issues-solutions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When developing desktop applications, particularly when using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework to build rich client applications, properly handling the user interface (UI) thread is crucial for ensuring the application’s smoothness and responsiveness. The UI thread, also known as the main thread, is the core thread responsible for processing window and control events, layout calculations, and rendering the UI. Any interaction with UI elements should be executed on the UI thread; this is a fundamental principle followed by WPF and most other GUI frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-ui-thread&#34;&gt;What is the UI Thread?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UI thread is created by the operating system when a WPF application starts and initializes the main application window. It’s the only thread within the application that can directly access and modify the state of UI components. This means all user interactions, such as button clicks, text box input, and window size changes, are processed in this thread context. Furthermore, WPF&amp;rsquo;s dependency property system, data binding mechanism, and layout logic are all synchronized on the UI thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;screen-freezing-phenomenon-and-its-causes&#34;&gt;Screen Freezing Phenomenon and Its Causes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the UI thread is heavily occupied or blocked for an extended period, such as when performing time-consuming calculations, loading large amounts of data, database queries, or other I/O-intensive tasks, it becomes unable to promptly respond to user interaction requests. This results in the UI freezing – what we commonly refer to as “stuttering” or “freezing.” In this situation, users will noticeably feel the application’s lag and lack of smoothness, and in severe cases, an &amp;ldquo;Application Not Responding&amp;rdquo; (ANR) warning may appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;two-basic-rules-for-the-ui-thread&#34;&gt;Two Basic Rules for the UI Thread
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid the above scenarios, WPF developers should adhere to the following two key rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not perform time-consuming operations on the UI thread:&lt;/strong&gt; Any operation that could cause the UI thread to block should be moved to a background thread as much as possible to ensure the UI thread can promptly respond to user input and render screen changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not directly update UI elements from non-UI threads:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to WPF’s security mechanism design, only the UI thread has permission to modify UI elements. Attempting to change UI state directly from another thread will throw an exception. Therefore, even if a background thread completes calculations or data preparation, you must use appropriate cross-thread communication mechanisms to display the results on the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions-asynchronous-programming-and-thread-safe-updates&#34;&gt;Solutions: Asynchronous Programming and Thread-Safe Updates
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To execute time-consuming tasks while maintaining UI fluency, WPF provides various asynchronous programming models and tools to assist developers in achieving this goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispatcher Object:&lt;/strong&gt; The WPF Dispatcher class allows you to schedule work items into the UI thread&amp;rsquo;s task queue for execution. You can use the &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher.Invoke&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher.BeginInvoke&lt;/code&gt; methods to safely update the UI from a background thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;async/await Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; Leveraging C#’s asynchronous features, you can write asynchronous methods and utilize the &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keyword within them to wait for background tasks to complete, automatically returning to the UI thread to execute subsequent UI update code upon completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-studies&#34;&gt;Case Studies
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-the-dispatcherinvoke-method-to-update-ui&#34;&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;Dispatcher.Invoke&lt;/code&gt; Method to Update UI
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-the-asyncawait-keyword-with-taskrun&#34;&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;async/await&lt;/code&gt; keyword with &lt;code&gt;Task.Run&lt;/code&gt;

        <title>Upgrading the GCC version caused program crashes: hidden issues due to code non-compliance.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/upgrade-gcc-version-causes-program-crash-code-irregularities/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 23:19:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/upgrade-gcc-version-causes-program-crash-code-irregularities/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the same business code scenario, the program compiled and ran normally in a CentOS 7 environment. However, when switching to CentOS 8 and using an updated version of GCC for compilation, the program crashed. It’s worth noting that the issue only occurs in &lt;strong&gt;Release mode&lt;/strong&gt;, while &lt;strong&gt;Debug mode&lt;/strong&gt; does not exhibit any problems. This is the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve encountered a situation like this; after three days of investigation, we finally identified the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;problem-identification&#34;&gt;Problem Identification
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After investigation, the root cause of the issue was &lt;strong&gt;the function lacked a return value&lt;/strong&gt;. In Release mode, new versions of GCC perform more optimizations, which caused an unknown logic to occur within the function that originally did not have an explicit return value during execution, leading to a crash. Our conclusion is that &lt;strong&gt;compiler warnings should not be ignored, especially in legacy projects where some warnings may be dismissed, but it’s also important to avoid suppressing all warnings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;environment-details&#34;&gt;Environment Details
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CentOS 7 GCC Version:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CentOS 8 GCC Version:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crash-phenomena&#34;&gt;Crash Phenomena
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When analyzing the stack trace of a program crash, the following stack information was observed:
This stack doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear intuitive; the crash function’s stack information displays as a ‘??’, which makes troubleshooting the issue even more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the issue, here is a minimal code example that reproduces the crash:
The &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function in this code clearly does not explicitly return a value, and its return type is &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. According to the C++ standard, when a function is declared as an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; type, it must have a return value, otherwise it may lead to undefined behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compilation-warnings&#34;&gt;Compilation Warnings
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our project, the CMake script suppresses many compiler warnings, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This warning indicates that the &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function does not return a value, which is the root cause of the problem. Newer versions of GCC (such as 8.5.0) may perform unstable optimizations on this undefined behavior when optimizing code, potentially leading to program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;assembly-code-differences&#34;&gt;Assembly Code Differences
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain the differences in GCC compiler optimization behavior, we compared assembly code generated by different versions of GCC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GCC 4.8.5 Generated Assembly Code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembly code is relatively verbose and includes logic for handling standard output streams (such as &lt;code&gt;std::cout&lt;/code&gt;). This indicates that the compiler performed more conservative optimizations, not optimizing excessively for the missing return value issue in the &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function, possibly to avoid a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GCC 8.5.0 Generated Assembly Code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version of GCC performed more optimizations, reducing the code volume. However, this optimization may have resulted in undefined behavior when executing a function without a return value, leading to program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this troubleshooting process, we deeply realized that in C++, &lt;strong&gt;function return values must be explicit&lt;/strong&gt;, especially when functions are declared as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, a return value must be provided. When upgrading from older versions of compilers to newer GCC versions, more optimization and stricter warning mechanisms may arise. Therefore, we recommend not suppressing all warnings during compilation, but rather selectively addressing them, particularly common issues such as function return values and type matching.
Ultimately, by adding a return value to the &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; function, the problem was resolved, and the program returned to normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>VMware Virtual Machine CPU Resource Usage Anomaly</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-machine-cpu-resource-usage-anomaly/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 22:14:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-machine-cpu-resource-usage-anomaly/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Background: The business system, running in Windows version, is deployed locally and consumes approximately 5% of CPU resources. The Linux version of the business system, deployed within a VMware-installed CentOS8 environment, exhibits abnormal resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-description&#34;&gt;Problem Description
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host Machine: Windows 10 Enterprise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VMware: 17.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual Machine: CentOS8
The virtual machine resource allocation is &lt;code&gt;4C8GB&lt;/code&gt;, running the business system. The business system is deployed in the Linux system within the virtual machine, and the internal top command observes system resource usage. CPU utilization is not high, while the external Windows system&amp;rsquo;s Task Manager shows very high CPU resource consumption. Examining processes reveals that the VMware process consumes a large amount of CPU resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;+
|         Windows           |

+&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;+&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-concepts&#34;&gt;Key Concepts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting this issue wasn’t smooth, as the root cause wasn&amp;rsquo;t the business system itself but rather issues with the virtual machine. How to shift thinking from conventional business code to system load, then from abnormal load data to pinpoint a soft interrupt, and finally arrive at the critical point – what factors affect VMware soft interrupt efficiency? This article will first introduce various concepts and then provide solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hyper-v&#34;&gt;Hyper-V
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virtualization technology for Windows operating systems underwent a significant transformation. When Microsoft initially released WSL, enabling the Hyper-V service would prevent VMware virtual machines from working simultaneously. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until subsequent versions that VMware could be compatible with the Hyper-V service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;system-load&#34;&gt;System Load
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Linux systems, &amp;ldquo;load&amp;rdquo; refers to the number of processes that are currently running or waiting to be executed. The load is typically represented by three numbers, which represent the average number of processes in the run queue over 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes, respectively. These numbers can be viewed by running the &lt;code&gt;uptime&lt;/code&gt; command or the &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, these three numbers represent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-minute load:&lt;/strong&gt; The average number of processes in the run queue over the past 1 minute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5-minute load:&lt;/strong&gt; The average number of processes in the run queue over the past 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15-minute load:&lt;/strong&gt; The average number of processes in the run queue over the past 15 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of the load is the number of processes waiting to be executed within the system. - If this number exceeds the logical CPU count of the system, it indicates a high system load, meaning many processes are waiting for processor resources. This can lead to sluggish performance or unresponsiveness, depending on the severity of the load and the configuration and performance of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally, the load should remain within the logical CPU count range to optimize system performance. If the load consistently exceeds the CPU count, further analysis of processes within the system may be necessary to identify the cause of the high load and take appropriate measures to adjust resource allocation or optimize process execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analyzing-load---mpstat&#34;&gt;Analyzing Load - mpstat
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; command is used to report multiple statistics for a single or multiple processors, including average load, CPU utilization, interrupts, and context switches. Within the &lt;code&gt;sysstat&lt;/code&gt; package, &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; is a valuable tool for analyzing system load conditions.  Below are the steps involved in performing load analysis using &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install sysstat:&lt;/strong&gt;
If &lt;code&gt;sysstat&lt;/code&gt; is not already installed on your system, use your system&amp;rsquo;s package manager to install it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run mpstat:&lt;/strong&gt;
Use the &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; command to view CPU usage and load. By default, &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; displays CPU utilization averages once per second. You can adjust the output frequency by specifying an interval. - For example, to run &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; at a rate of one frequency per second, you can use the following command: &lt;code&gt;mpstat -P ALL 2&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; represents resource utilization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyze Output&lt;/strong&gt;:
The output of &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; includes CPU utilization for each CPU, as well as the system&amp;rsquo;s average load. Pay particular attention to the average load and the utilization of each CPU to understand the system’s workload. If the load is high, you can further analyze which processes are causing it, and whether there are any performance bottlenecks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analyze-load---mpstat&#34;&gt;Analyze Load - mpstat
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combine with Other Tools&lt;/strong&gt;:
In addition to &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt;, you can also use tools like &lt;code&gt;sar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pidstat&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;iostat&lt;/code&gt; to comprehensively analyze system performance. By combining the outputs of multiple tools, you can gain a more complete understanding of the system&amp;rsquo;s load situation and identify the root causes of performance issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interrupt&#34;&gt;Interrupt
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section doesn&amp;rsquo;t elaborate on the content too much,
Recommended: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.codedump.info/post/20200522-sgfap-softirq/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;System Guide for Application Developers - CPU Part - Soft Interrupt&lt;/a&gt;
Frequent triggering of soft interrupts will also be reflected in system load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that analysis solely from the CPU perspective couldn’t pinpoint the issue, should we start to suspect that the system had become abnormal? It might be due to high load on the Linux operating system, causing VMware to consume excessive CPU resources. By using &lt;code&gt;mpstat&lt;/code&gt; to analyze local virtual machines, we found that &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; utilization was abnormally high, approaching 25% per core, while in normal circumstances, when business processes were idle, &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; should have been around 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a colleague’s development environment within the group, his CentOS 7 deployment on VMware showed normal resource usage. Conversely, in the Shanghai development environment, although also running on VMware, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t directly observe the host machine’s CPU resource situation. At this point, we faced multiple variables: the VMware virtual machines, the Linux operating system, and the GCC version. - Analyzing the test environment, the Shenzhen test environment is deployed on physical machines running low versions of GCC compiled services. It’s also running on CentOS 8. Interestingly, &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; usage remained normal within the Shenzhen environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate potential issues introduced by the GCC version, we deployed programs compiled with a higher version of GCC to the Shenzhen environment for testing, which also yielded no problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue seemed to become clearer as we began to suspect that there might be an operating system problem. After all, CentOS 8 is no longer officially supported. Even after redeploying clean CentOS 7 and CentOS 8 instances, the problem persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting-1&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, we began to suspect the only unknown factor – VMware virtual machine software. Suddenly, a flash of insight occurred; we thought of Hyper-V technology. Could Hyper-V have been enabled previously but not completely disabled, causing this issue? After all, soft interrupts are also implemented through virtualization software. Do different virtualization technologies have bugs? These questions deserve in-depth consideration and investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Microsoft’s official documentation, after completely disabling the Hyper-V service on the machine, VMware recovered normal operation on the host. This finally resolved the issue. As initially stated, this experience was convoluted and arduous, requiring comprehensive analysis and judgment. It was also our first time troubleshooting and pinpointing the problem to the virtual machine level.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>C&#43;&#43; Programming Traps: A Detailed Explanation of Program Crashes Caused by Improper Use of `std::map`</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-programming-traps-std-map-crash-details/</link>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-programming-traps-std-map-crash-details/</guid>
        <description>e&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;body&#34;&gt;Body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the C++ standard library, &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt; is an associative container that stores elements in ascending order based on their keys (key), and provides efficient keyword lookup functionality. However, novice developers sometimes find themselves in trouble due to a misunderstanding of the behavior of the square bracket operator &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, when using &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; to access a non-existent key, &lt;code&gt;std::map&lt;/code&gt; inserts a new key-value pair, and the default constructor will be used to initialize the value type associated with that key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this code does not directly cause the program to crash, this implicit insertion behavior can lead to unexpected side effects in certain situations, such as resource leaks or changes inconsistent with expectations. Worse still, concurrent access to uninitialized memory regions in a multithreaded environment can even cause the program to crash. To prevent such issues, it is recommended to use the &lt;code&gt;std::map::find()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;std::map::count()&lt;/code&gt; methods to check if a key exists, or to explicitly insert elements using the &lt;code&gt;std::map::insert()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the map container internally stores objects of pointer types, the automatic insertion behavior will save an uninitialized pointer, and any call to this pointer will cause the program to crash.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>pstack troubleshoot a hung process</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/pstack-troubleshooting-process-hang/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In software development and operations, deadlocked processes are frequently encountered. This situation can lead to performance degradation or service unavailability. This article introduces how to use the pstack tool to troubleshoot deadlocked process issues by analyzing process stack information to identify the root cause and resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: A child service within the risk control system experienced a deadlocked state, resulting in the unavailability of the risk control service. Due to the lack of service availability monitoring, the deadlocked process situation was not detected in a timely manner, leading to system unavailability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hung process refers to a process that has stopped responding but hasn&amp;rsquo;t exited. This situation can be caused by various reasons, such as deadlocks, resource exhaustion, or exceptions. To resolve these issues, we can use the &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool to analyze the process’s stack information and identify the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps&#34;&gt;Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; is a commonly used tool, often provided alongside &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; (GNU Debugger). You can install it using the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obtain Process ID: First, we need to obtain the process ID (PID) of the zombie process. We can use the &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; command to list all processes and find the process ID that needs to be investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool to analyze the process stack. Once you have obtained the process ID, you can use the &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool to retrieve the stack information for that process. Run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will output the stack information for the process, displaying the sequence of function calls currently being executed. By analyzing this information, you can identify where the process is stuck and thus pinpoint the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyze Stack Information: By viewing the stack information, you can find the cause of the process becoming a zombie. You may discover deadlock situations, infinite loops, or other abnormal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-study&#34;&gt;Case Study
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple demo: after the main function starts, a child thread is created and the actual function enters a dead loop, causing the program to fail to terminate normally and enter a state of false death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the program and executing the pstack results shows:
You can see that the reason for the process being in a false death state is due to the dead loop; the main thread enters the dead loop, the child thread cannot exit, leading to the process being in a false death state.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If things had gone as the family planned, I would have stuck to studying power grids honestly and diligently, without venturing into coding. Had I erased the dust from my memory, it all started with a chat with my roommate near the Spring Festival, which led to a review of my experiences over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1&#34;&gt;Chapter 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the college entrance exam couldn’t be described as good or bad; I ended up graduating from a 211 university, and according to my father&amp;rsquo;s initial plan, I should have studied power grids and returned to work for the local power supply bureau in our hometown. There had also been mentions earlier about how to step by step take this path into the IT industry – something that hadn’t been mentioned before: financial views and self-control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to school in a rural town in elementary and middle school, and my family arranged for me to transfer to a school in the city district in middle school, much like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden; there was some initial difficulty adapting to the hustle and bustle of the city. I hadn’t been to a movie theater very often, to be precise, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone to the movies with my parents, but relatives would take me. Heaven always gives you luck; back then, I met several friends who were just like me, although we lost contact later on, that period of my youth is now seen as beautiful. After catching up on tutoring over the weekend, we’d gather to tidy up the classroom, expertly kicking flattened plastic bottles into our backpacks to take back to Mom for storage. As they accumulated, we&amp;rsquo;d find a waste collector to handle them. We’d play chess, badminton, and Mahjong – if I lost, I’d do a few push-ups; it was a small consolation at the time. Dad had been taking me through all sorts of exercises since I was little. At this point, my understanding of money was slightly skewed, and I felt a bit insecure, but these minor setbacks quickly passed. Our family wasn&amp;rsquo;t struggling – we simply didn’t have much pocket money, and sometimes couldn’t join our classmates in their activities, especially on weekends. Seeing our parents’ efforts as we moved from the village to the city… it was like planting a seed, waiting for it to sprout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-one&#34;&gt;Chapter One
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a simple-minded individual, I found my time studying to be generally very happy, much like many people can only truly appreciate after graduating – reading isn’t actually that difficult of a task, and the conversion of investment into output is relatively easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-one-1&#34;&gt;Chapter One
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I absorbed the memories of the Age of Empires era. During university, encountering a laptop was like opening Pandora’s Box – I discovered games and connected with game merchants. Initially, I was a low-level salesperson, sourcing goods upstream and selling them through my own community channels to earn a little money. Later, I gradually understood the operational logic of the entire chain. The products we sold were merely mass-produced by upstream programs, and their costs approached zero. At this time, the road had already started to slant a bit. Within the field of expertise, there were increasingly specialized sub-disciplines: on the left was power grids, and on the right was automation (very complex – chip programming, factory electrical automation). I understood that programs could make money, but it wasn’t a huge sum; the upstream channels definitely made a lot of money. Adding to this my previous foundation in programming, I started experimenting with various things, making a little money here and there. When the time came for specialization, I naturally chose automation. After completing most of my senior-level courses, many of which I didn’t attend, I was constantly thinking about writing code to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year&amp;rsquo;s article mentioned a fascination with hackers, leading me to contact programming. Without formal training in IT, I used compassion to learn assembly language, penetration testing, game cheats, DLL hijacking, and phishing – familiarizing myself with various black-hat and gray-hat products. My parents taught me how to be a good person, which ultimately dissuaded me from completely straying down the wrong path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-1&#34;&gt;Chapter 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous Post Link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/then-boy-talent-not-much/&#34; &gt;That Time When I Was Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a brief relationship during university. Looking back, it was more about yearning for the romance depicted in television dramas. As an immature young man at the time, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand how to love someone, let alone achieve: settling down and starting a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-two&#34;&gt;Chapter Two
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst the torrent of times, I was fortunate – university’s tribulations led me to a direct entry into employment rather than graduate school. Upon graduation, I joined the workforce, riding the wave of IT’s prosperity with smooth and steady progress. Now in my eighth year of work, the industry&amp;rsquo;s speculative heat dissipated, inevitably leading to decline. Sometimes, I question whether my initial choice was correct; perhaps entering a utility company as suggested by my father would have been a better path. If these thoughts were prevalent during the first five years of my career, they gradually faded away with time. Through campus recruitment, I joined HSBC, remaining with the same company for five years without switching roles. This has resulted in certain deficiencies regarding technological understanding, industry knowledge, and self-awareness of one’s capabilities. Following the arrangement of the headquarters in Hangzhou, I went to the Shenzhen branch, experiencing a workplace struggle (after clarifying the situation, both sides lost out, and the board of directors ultimately benefited), returning to Hangzhou with a passion for technology, carrying a touch of youthful naiveté, having run off to Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally planned to settle down in Hangzhou, purchase property, and register, at the highest interest rates and peak housing prices, it was intended to be a trap – my finances were limited and I couldn’t afford it. If I had been burdened with mortgage payments while the industry was declining, my emotions would have become unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-three&#34;&gt;Chapter Three
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having been around for so many years, having seen so much, I’ve made my own mistakes and wasted time, and currently, things are still going well. Experiencing things, experiencing people – it all leads to gradual growth. If you were to stay at home constantly, I wonder what form the flaws in my personality would manifest themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Designed a行情 SDK, implementing different callback function implementations, and performed an extensive test. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into C++ function programming, where functions have become first-class citizens, flowing within the program internally – what’s the difference in performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous article link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/compiler-callback-function-performance-testing/&#34; &gt;Compiler, Callback Functions, Performance Testing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;code&gt;leimao&lt;/code&gt;大佬 also did similar tests, so I borrowed their code.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why do computers generally use little-endian storage?</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Regarding byte order: A layman&amp;rsquo;s explanation &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://example.com/post/2023/01-10-%e4%b8%bb%e6%9c%ba%e5%ba%8f%e3%80%81%e7%bd%91%e7%bb%9c%e5%ba%8f%ef%bc%8c%e9%80%9a%e8%bf%87%e8%b0%83%e8%af%95%e5%99%a8%ef%bc%8c%e7%9b%b4%e6%8e%a5%e8%a7%82%e5%af%9f&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Host Order, Network Order, observed directly through debugger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of computer science, certain design habits have formed due to historical reasons, just like the width of a person&amp;rsquo;s buttocks determines the width of a rocket’s thrusters – there’s no need to rigidly analyze their “advantages” and “disadvantages”; it’s simply a matter of historical convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the current situation is a result of historical habits + commercialization, and has little to do with technology itself. ARM can be set up in big-endian or little-endian format. The TCP/IP header still uses big-endian (network byte order). There are also many storage protocols/specifications in the storage field that save data in a big-endian manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the three questions posed by the user seem to be incorrect in today&amp;rsquo;s view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do computers generally adopt little-endian storage? –&amp;gt; Incorrect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is low-byte storage more efficient in a little-endian way than in a big-endian way? –&amp;gt; Efficiency will not be higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any argument about these three questions using current technology belongs to shooting first and drawing the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;translated-text&#34;&gt;Translated Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to the choice between big-endian and little-endian, there were indeed certain objective factors in the history of computer development: The advantage of host byte order (little-endian) is that little-endian adders are easier to implement. If you create an 8-bit * 4 adder, you only need one 8-bit adder and sequentially add all bytes from low to high. The carry circuit is very simple. In contrast, if using big-endian, you would need to load a 32-bit value at once, otherwise it wouldn’t be possible to perform calculations. Looking back now, the difference between loading 8 bits or 32 bits is not significant; however, in the decades of the past, memory prices were high, so simplicity was paramount. Therefore, the host byte order selection for little-endian was based on cost considerations. The advantages of network big-endian byte order: In the early days, caches on devices were very small. Receiving the high byte first allowed for a quick determination of message information: packet length (how much cache to prepare), address range (IP addresses are matched from front to back). Early network devices’ caches were at the byte level; taking the high byte first was indeed slightly faster. Therefore, network devices used big-endian due to cost considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the choice of byte order was primarily influenced by application scenarios and costs (such as PPC/MIPS being more suitable for networking equipment), while later technological developments were driven by compatibility reasons, leading to the continued use of big-endian. In today’s view, these advantages no longer exist; they are simply historical habits.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A sudden urge to browse for new wallpapers, sticking with the familiar black series, with some areas colored and the rest remaining black. The desktop needs to display icons, but other color schemes result in them appearing blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stared at the assembly code, trying to figure it out, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand it. I tried throwing it to an &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, explaining the instructions, but it failed to explain the context – clearly, this was a command used for a specific scenario. Regular code isn’t like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; was no match for a search engine at this point; its knowledge base of assembly language was insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;TrapFlag&lt;/code&gt; is a flag bit in the register file that, when set, triggers an exception &lt;code&gt;SINGLE_STEP&lt;/code&gt;. Because if we trace the code, this flag will be cleared by the debugger, and we won&amp;rsquo;t see the exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In actual testing, if you directly step over detecting functions, debugging will not be detected. Only when entering the detection function to execute will it be detected (based on research materials, but yet to be verified in practice).&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, someone asked how to download Focus Interview videos. My mind immediately went to the usual – eight or nine out of ten times it’s encrypted using an &lt;code&gt;m3u8&lt;/code&gt; method, and a bit of simple processing is all it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;downloader&#34;&gt;Downloader

    &gt;Live Stream Downloader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;honeyed-confidence&#34;&gt;Honeyed Confidence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the address, assuming it was solved, turned out to be nothing – unable to parse segments normally, query information, and discovered that the official party had processed the download address, requiring manual replacement of the &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; parsed by the plugin into the following links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of January 2024, the address is still valid for testing; if there are any changes in the future, analyze the webpage independently.

        <title>Bulk Modify SQL Server Database Disk File Permissions</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-modify-sqlserver-database-disk-file-permissions/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The company adjusted its security policies. Ultimately, ‘Mechanical Mini’ was relocated back home as a backup server, along with a full system reinstallation. Ubuntu switched to Windows Server; due to an irregular activation method – used at home – it seemed like it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be activated, and that was fine. An unconventional activation triggered Microsoft’s detection (running normally for half a month), the server would automatically shut down after running for one hour. After reviewing the system logs, it was discovered that this was due to using a pirated version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t much else to do, so the system was reinstalled again, and SQL Server also needed to be reinstalled – it&amp;rsquo;s always a bit frustrating. File permission management is strict, making it impossible to attach databases normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;error-message&#34;&gt;Error Message
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the system reinstallation, &lt;code&gt;SqlServer&lt;/code&gt; may encounter error 5120, an operating system access denied error, when attaching a database.&lt;/p&gt;

Most online tutorials instruct you to manually modify files; they only need to change a few files each time? I have batches of files to process, and manually handling them would drive me crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Windows platform has RuMaster (Entertainment Master), which isn’t known for highly accurate data, but it still provides some reference. Of course, there are other professional benchmarking software options as well. When it comes to Linux systems, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t seemed to be a particularly suitable benchmarking software available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sysbench is a versatile benchmark testing tool that can be used to test CPU, memory, file I/O, thread performance, and more. You can use Sysbench to execute various performance testing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently have three machines available for testing: the Mechanical Artist mini laptop, a local small host machine, an Alibaba Cloud Dev development cloud server, and a Huawei Cloud Dev server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-sysbench&#34;&gt;Installing Sysbench
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On most Linux distributions, you can install Sysbench using a package manager. For example, on CentOS 8, you can use the following command to install it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sysbench-usage-examples&#34;&gt;Sysbench Usage Examples
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing CPU performance: &lt;code&gt;sysbench --test=cpu run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing memory read performance: &lt;code&gt;sysbench --test=memory run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing file I/O performance:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing multi-threaded performance: &lt;code&gt;sysbench --test=threads --num-threads=4 run&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing MySQL database performance (adjust maximum connections as needed):&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt; is a good thing or not, the table above couldn’t be arranged according to previously mastered &lt;code&gt;Markdown&lt;/code&gt;, and failing to create a table would result in a poor display effect. Customizing the theme limited the maximum width of the page, so I adjusted the configuration of the pages accordingly, changing the width to percentage limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple method is to use tools like TablesGenerator to generate HTML tables (content complexity doesn’t suit this).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or you can write it in Google Docs and then download and save it as an HTML document, directly copy it into a blog (simple and direct, which was ultimately adopted).
Ensure that the config is enabled with unsafe configuration items, and give the page configuration width separately. In Hugo, you can set the width of a page individually. This can be achieved by adding custom parameters in the page’s Front Matter. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example: In your Markdown page&amp;rsquo;s Front Matter section (typically at the beginning of the file), add a custom parameter, such as &lt;code&gt;custom_width&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your Hugo theme, find or create the corresponding single-page template file (e.g., &lt;code&gt;layouts/_default/single.html&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue-1&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within a single-page template, check the Front Matter of the page for the &lt;code&gt;custom_width&lt;/code&gt; parameter and apply it to the corresponding HTML elements, such as &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;:
In this example, we used inline styles (&lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; attribute) to set the &lt;code&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt; property on the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; element, making its width default to 100% when the &lt;code&gt;custom_width&lt;/code&gt; parameter is not specified.  &lt;code&gt;margin: 0 auto;&lt;/code&gt; is used to center the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; element.
Please note that in actual use, you may need to adjust the above example based on your theme structure and CSS styling details. Ensure that when adjusting styles, you maintain consistency and readability within your theme.
Due to slight variations in the enabled theme, the site&amp;rsquo;s custom &lt;code&gt;CSS&lt;/code&gt; configuration was finally adjusted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Git Disable HTTP Repository</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-disable-http-repositories/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 21:22:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/git-disable-http-repositories/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Update the habit of software version, unknown from which version of &lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt; to start, prohibit pulling code from &lt;code&gt;Http&lt;/code&gt; repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-introduction&#34;&gt;Background Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environment: Windows platform, I’ve always used Little Turtle to operate Git, and key configuration was also handled through it. I previously created a script to batch update local repositories.
Previous article link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-repository-and-legacy-permission-issues/&#34; &gt;Batch Update Local Git Repository&lt;/a&gt;
Today when executing the code update at home, the previous error occurred, and the repository could no longer be updated normally. I was planning to use &lt;code&gt;Git&lt;/code&gt;’s configuration to continue using the &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; protocol to update the repository, but I searched everywhere without finding the corresponding configuration item.
The simplest solution is of course to switch to the &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; protocol to update the repository, as the &lt;code&gt;gitlab&lt;/code&gt; configured by the company will not provide the &lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; protocol in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy-issues&#34;&gt;Legacy Issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing the batch update local repository script previously, we initially planned to use &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; to pull the repository and didn&amp;rsquo;t thoroughly investigate why. The &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; configuration information configured via TortoiseGit was not synchronized to the config file, resulting in errors when executing through the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking key configurations with commands like &lt;code&gt;ssh -T git@gitlab.yintech.net&lt;/code&gt; were correct. If you can successfully pull code using Git Small Turtle (TortoiseGit), but receive a &amp;ldquo;key incorrect&amp;rdquo; error when using the &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; command, this might be because TortoiseGit is using PuTTY&amp;rsquo;s SSH key while the command line uses OpenSSH&amp;rsquo;s SSH key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keys configured in TortoiseGit do not come from the system . Here’s the English translation of the provided text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When reading a secret key file via SSH folder, it instead uses the interface repository configuration to independently configure the path of the key file. A useful trick is to pull the first repository with its configured key, allowing subsequent repositories to reuse that same key. After PuTTY loads the key, it doesn’t immediately exit but starts a proxy service. By adjusting global settings and not using the system&amp;rsquo;s default &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; configuration, Git Bash will use TortoisePlink for SSH operations. This configuration is suitable when using the PuTTY tool provided by TortoiseGit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy-issues-1&#34;&gt;Legacy Issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please modify the execution file path in the above configuration to match your specific Mini Turtle path. Due to the complete path configured, no need to add the path to the system environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>AI Programming and Task Decomposition</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-programming-and-task-decomposition/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 08:44:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-programming-and-task-decomposition/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I added a copy function to the site, which took me half a day of tinkering. Ultimately, the rendering effect wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite satisfactory, and as a somewhat mediocre frontend developer, I didn’t plan on improving it – if it worked, it was good enough. This year, I used &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; to develop a mini-program, which has made me more familiar with frontend development. I refactored it (the &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; redesigned it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realization: Breaking down tasks really helps; many small tasks are quite natural for the &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; to develop. For the closed mini-program, 75% of the code was provided by &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, broken down into multiple tasks delivered, and manually assembled the project code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;previous-context&#34;&gt;Previous Context
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.github.io/post/2022/001/%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%BA%E5%BE%88%E7%AE%80%E5%8D%95%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%8B%E6%83%85%E5%A2%9E%E5%8A%A0%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E5%A4%8D%E5%88%B6%E6%8C%89%E9%92%AE/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Making simple things easier: Adding a code copy button&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;promot&lt;/strong&gt;: Design CSS and JavaScript code to locate webpage elements with the class &amp;ldquo;highlight&amp;rdquo;, and add a copy button within its container, enabling copy-to-clipboard functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first draft of the code was immediately problematic; I regenerated it, making it largely usable, but the copied content was incorrect, containing redundant text. Further guidance led to optimizing the core color design and specifying desired effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having learned your specific requirements for button size and color, we redesigned the button styles to accommodate these demands.  Below is an adjusted CSS style that incorporates your provided color scheme and optimizes the button&amp;rsquo;s dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within this style, I reduced the button’s size and font size to create a more refined look. “Simultaneously, the button’s default state is semi-transparent. When hovering over the button, it becomes opaque and the background color slightly brightens to provide visual feedback. This design meets your color requirements while maintaining a modern and user-friendly aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simpler &lt;code&gt;JavaScript&lt;/code&gt; implementation has also been provided:”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I had hoped to see a copy button added to the top-right corner of the code area, due to my lack of familiarity with front-end development and an inability to accurately describe the functionality based on keywords and “AI,” I spent several rounds chasing after it without achieving the desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen what impact “AI” will have on software development as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Oriental Zhentan Short Essay Incident: A Collision of Culture and Commerce</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/dongfang-zhenxuan-essay-controversy-culture-vs-commerce/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Zen Selection short essay incident was a online uproar triggered by Oriental Zen Selection’s official account denying that anchor Dong Yufei was the author of all the short essays. The truth is now unrecoverable, and the company&amp;rsquo;s power struggles have pushed this matter into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish’s seven-second memory will be handed over to &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; for writing, having experimented with &lt;code&gt;Bing AI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT Plus&lt;/code&gt;. The former provided more complete information, while the search engine still obtained more data, but the output blog content was not as complete and had a rigid format; the latter generated content based on keywords, which wasn’t as complete but could obtain full blog content. If given the URLs of reference materials, it could optimize the generated article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dongyu Hui incident, involving Oriental Select’s short essay event, was a dispute centered around copyright and creative ownership. Beginning on December 5th, 2023, it involved a series of interactions between anchor Dongyu Hui and Oriental Select. This storm not only revealed the complexities of commercial operations but also sparked profound reflections on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-5-2023-event-origin&#34;&gt;December 5, 2023: Event Origin
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongyu Hui, a host from Oriental Zhentan, quickly went viral after reciting “short essays” in a pre-release video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Zhentan stated in the video comments that most of these short essays were created by the copywriting team and not entirely from Dongyu Hui’s own hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-13-2023-dong-yufeis-response&#34;&gt;December 13, 2023: Dong Yufei’s Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Yufei published a lengthy article opposing the defamation of anyone under the guise of “fan circles,” stating her position on the matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-14-2023-management-response&#34;&gt;December 14, 2023: Management Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Xuhe (CEO of Oriental Zhensheng) released an apology video, admitting to management loopholes within the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yu Minhong (Chairman of Oriental Zhensheng) also responded to the incident, expressing apologies to Dong Yuhui.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-16-2023-major-decisions&#34;&gt;December 16, 2023: Major Decisions
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongqian Select officially removed Sun Dongxu from the CEO position, with Yu Minhong assuming the role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the same day, Yu Minhong published an apology letter, stating that he would unblock users who had been banned from live streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-18-2023-dong-yufeis-new-role&#34;&gt;December 18, 2023: Dong Yufei’s New Role
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Oriental Education &amp;amp; Technology Group appoints Dong Yufei as Chairman and Cultural Assistant of New Oriental Education &amp;amp; Technology Group, concurrently serving as Vice President of New Oriental Culture &amp;amp; Tourism Group.
-俞敏洪 (Yu Minhong) revealed that he will establish a studio with Dong Yufei to open new live broadcast accounts and live rooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-and-reflection&#34;&gt;Conclusion and Reflection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This storm was not only a dispute over copyright and creative ownership, but also deeply reflected the collision between culture and commerce. In today’s digital and fragmented era, the ownership of content copyrights has become a topic worthy of deep consideration. The Oriental Sanshifen Incident involving Xiaowen (Little Essay) was not just a media storm, but also a profound reflection on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As observers, how should we view this collision between culture and commerce? While pursuing commercial interests, how can we protect and respect the labor results of creators? These questions deserve our deep consideration by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game Psychology: Competitive Gaming</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-esports/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 10:26:22 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-esports/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay-to-Win games, which will not be discussed here within the gaming community; a collective term for “People’s Warriors,” requiring an affluent wallet rather than understanding of game settings. Their enjoyment lies in the surrounding throng of smaller players and the thrill of “raid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitive games with large audiences, such as League of Legends, DOTA, Honor of Kings, and PUBG – these types of games have complete worldviews and their esports events are in a healthy cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology is indeed a key field in game design, with social psychology being particularly important. Understanding people’s behavior, needs, and motivations can help design more engaging gaming experiences. Regarding the relationship between “bragging” and social psychology, we can look at it from the following angles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Validation:&lt;/strong&gt; People often seek to establish a sense of belonging within social groups. In games, if designed to allow players to feel accomplished in certain areas and attract the attention of other players, this can increase their social validation. This may manifest as boasting skills or showcasing earned rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games employ elements of social competition, encouraging players to showcase their achievements within a social network. This can be achieved through leaderboards, achievement systems, or multiplayer battles. Such designs stimulate competitive psychology between players, which may lead some players to perform even more impressively in order to gain social recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Expression:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games allow players to express themselves through customization options like character avatars and virtual items. This self-expression isn’t just about showing off; it can also be a way to express personality and engage in social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teamwork:&lt;/strong&gt; Certain games emphasize teamwork, achieving game objectives through social interaction. In these scenarios, boasting behavior may not be encouraged but rather emphasizes collaboration and mutual support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Reward Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design can utilize psychological reward systems to incentivize positive social behaviors. For example, rewarding players or granting them privileges to encourage active participation in social interactions.
Overall, the application of social psychology in game design can be used to shape player interaction and social experiences. Fluffing (or showing off) behavior can sometimes occur in certain contexts, but game designers typically strive to balance this behavior to ensure the gaming experience is positive and enjoyable for all players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to get sidetracked when thinking about things; without a complete outline, it does tend to become a bit disorganized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author’s frequently played League of Legends is considered one of our generation&amp;rsquo;s cherished childhood memories. Most parents don’t like their children playing games, as they haven’t deeply understood or experienced this type of game, and naturally, it has to do with the game’s setting. Each match is a fresh start, and for many kids, when playing, they don’t bring much thought into it, opting for a self-exploratory style of gameplay. Under this mode, the outcome of the game often depends more on the child&amp;rsquo;s inherent gaming talent. Based on the author’s personal experience, a significant portion of players fall into this category; for them…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost isn’t money, it’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s also a casual mode within the game, designed to meet the needs of entertainment players.
League of Legends, this competitive game, for me, was more about realizing a “Three Kingdoms dream.” Starting with an empty purse, relying on my own understanding, I farmed, supplemented, spent money, controlled vision, set traps for the enemy team, and it was primarily a game played with my mind – without exceptional gaming talent, I could still have a lot of fun. The feeling of controlling the overall situation, and the joy of turning a disadvantage into a victory. There are also many viewers who often mention “ghost players” – they no longer play the game but still watch the matches during major world championship events.
Here, we must also talk about “game time.” “I’m not talking about the time of a single game, but rather the time you log in. This includes weekend afternoons and evenings between 7 PM and 10 PM during weekdays – at this time, you&amp;rsquo;ll generally find that you can communicate normally with your teammates, receiving their signals and getting responses back. If you switch to other times, such as late-night gaming sessions, you’re more likely to encounter ‘gaming addicts,’ favorable wind conditions (where nothing happens), and players who will greet you with insults when you&amp;rsquo;re behind. Even through the screen, you can feel their ‘hostility.’”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As someone working in the IT industry and having played many different types of games, I’ve always preferred to play competitive games using my brain – it’s about strategy and execution rather than reaction speed or raw talent. Compared to younger players or professionals, my response time is slower, and I&amp;rsquo;m accustomed to leading a team through coordinated strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, how would you describe the current game environment? It’s quite frantic and lacks the pure essence of what it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduating, playing high-level games was really exhausting – it required complete focus throughout the entire match, thinking about the opponent’s plans and how to counter their setups. It&amp;rsquo;s that feeling where you don&amp;rsquo;t want to continue after finishing a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you say you play very well, without professional competition, it wouldn’t have much impact on one’s life trajectory. While it can be used as a social tool, it cannot provide a livelihood or establish oneself in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-player and online games are two different types of games with significant differences in gameplay, experience, and technology. Here are some key aspects to understand the distinction between single-player and online games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connection Method:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-player Games (Offline/Single-player):&lt;/strong&gt; These games are played on a local device alone, without requiring an internet connection. Players can enjoy the game experience even without network connectivity. - &lt;strong&gt;Online/Multiplayer Games:&lt;/strong&gt; These games typically require an internet connection because players need to interact in real-time with other players. Online games can be cooperative or competitive, involving online social interaction and esports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player Interaction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players primarily interact with in-game artificial intelligence, pre-set tasks, or hostile elements. The gaming experience is typically more personalized and influenced by the game’s design and storyline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiplayer Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players can interact with other real players from around the world. This may include collaborating on missions, competing against each other, participating in esports, and social elements such as chat, guild systems, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Design and Content:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design focuses more on providing a complete and independent storyline and gaming experience. Game content is typically pre-designed, and players explore, solve puzzles, or engage in combat within the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiplayer Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design needs to consider real-time interaction and player competition or collaboration. Game content may be more dynamic, including regular updates, online events, and social interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Typically can run offline with relatively low requirements for device performance and internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Require a strong internet connection and have high demands on server and network performance to ensure smooth real-time interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Model:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Typically employ a one-time purchase or download model, where players buy the game to play it fully on their local devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; May utilize various business models such as free-to-play, advertising, item purchases, or subscriptions to maintain server operations and continuously update game content.
Understanding these distinctions helps players clarify their preferences when choosing games and enables game designers to better meet player expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

        <title>Cloud Servers and Script Kiddies</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cloud-servers-and-script-kids/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 15:08:53 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/cloud-servers-and-script-kids/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of the Singles Day promotion, Alibaba Cloud recently purchased a server: an economy-friendly version for 99 a year with low specifications, serving as a jumpstart machine to proxy home services – which is quite good. The promotion continues until 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I chose a server in the Shanghai region to minimize latency when proxying my home machines. It runs Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022; the server version was deployed later. While using it, I suddenly received a &amp;ldquo;access denied&amp;rdquo; message, initially thinking it was due to a server update that would resolve itself. After waiting five minutes and trying again, the denial persisted. Searching for related error messages indicated that someone was attempting to log in, and because of too many incorrect password attempts, login was now blocked. - Previously, I had encountered scripts related to security attacks, and immediately thought of this. These logins were likely not normal behavior; someone was attacking the service, attempting a brute-force login to the server. The server’s firewall was overly simplistic – it wasn&amp;rsquo;t configured with a whitelist, and it proxied ports 3389 for two machines, exposing them publicly—much like bait in a fishpond. Now that we knew it was script kiddies attacking, things became much simpler: configure the firewall whitelist to only allow access from the company’s IP address and my home IP address to the proxy service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;frps&lt;/code&gt; agent server previously had no configuration for running logs. Opening the logs was hilarious – all the proxy IPs across the country were trying to log into my home server. Thankfully, there was one that was a server version, which made me realize the problem: otherwise, that Windows 11 machine would have been compromised eventually; the password settings are relatively simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I checked out the login logs for Linux services – aside from this Alibaba Cloud machine, there’s also a friend&amp;rsquo;s Huawei Cloud machine. This Huawei Cloud machine has been running for a long time and is already in the middle of dictionary cracking; various strange users have started to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing a self-hosted server requires setting up a whitelist for public Windows access, and on Linux systems, it’s recommended to disable password logins and enable key file login.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>- Batch update local Git repositories and resolve legacy permission issues.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-repository-and-legacy-permission-issues/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 14:16:22 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-repository-and-legacy-permission-issues/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The projects within the team have dependencies on each other, and due to historical reasons, submodules haven’t been used to manage these project dependencies. Daily development requires manually updating the repository code one by one, otherwise various strange issues may arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to online resources, the structure is generally similar. A local manual repository directory (&lt;strong&gt;git_list.txt&lt;/strong&gt;) is maintained, and a script iterates through the directories to perform an update in one go. Before starting each project, this script needs to be executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;linux&#34;&gt;linux
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;create new file: batch_pull.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;windows&#34;&gt;Windows
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a new file: batch_pull.bat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;historical-issues&#34;&gt;Historical Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also addressed the &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; folder permission files encountered after reinstalling the system: &lt;strong&gt;Fatal error &amp;ldquo;unsafe repository (&amp;rsquo;/home/repon&amp;rsquo; is owned by someone else)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;
Most suggested solutions online originate from &lt;code&gt;stack overflow&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add trust to the repository directory: &lt;code&gt;git config --global --add safe.directory /home/repon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manually modify the configuration file &lt;code&gt;.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt;, specifying the directory to add trust
After using these methods, repository updates were normal, but numerous warning messages appeared in the console every time &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; was executed, indicating owner errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reinstalling-the-system-on-a-desktop-machine&#34;&gt;Reinstalling the System on a Desktop Machine
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine hadn&amp;rsquo;t been reinstalled for a long time, and the system partition was filled with a massive amount of garbage files, leaving me no choice but to take some time to reinstall it. I ran into this permission issue again, and previous scripts wouldn’t run because the permissions were incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the new approach, I simply added &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, which automatically trusts all directories for &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s a user permission issue, or perhaps everyone hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten used to the fact that Windows also has similar commands like &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt; to modify folder owners. Of course, if you have only a few directories, you can manually change the owner. However, this work computer has domain information added, and I’m not sure whether it’s due to an anomaly in the company&amp;rsquo;s deployed domain or an abnormality in the local system settings. In the user list, I couldn’t find the user used for login. Finally, I resolved it by processing through the command line.  Running the &lt;code&gt;change_ower.ps1&lt;/code&gt; PowerShell script with administrator privileges. ps1&lt;code&gt;，remember to adjust the script file encoding to &lt;/code&gt;gbk&lt;code&gt;, for Chinese operating systems, otherwise it will be garbled. Unexpected situations still appeared, the Chinese information output by the script was garbled, trying to set the console character encoding, adjusting the script encoding, all outputs were garbled, my brain must have been pretty messed up, try enabling Control Panel-Region-Language Settings beta function, globally enable Unicode encoding, the script executed normally, several development software could not work properly, I will review the materials later and realized that adjusting the script file encoding to &lt;/code&gt;gbk` ### Reinstalling the System on a Desktop Machine
The machine, which hadn&amp;rsquo;t been reinstalled for a long time, had an explosion of garbage system files, leaving me with no choice but to take some time and reinstall it. I ran into this permission issue again, and previous scripts wouldn’t run because the permissions were incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the new approach, I simply added &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, which automatically trusts all directories for &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s a user permission issue, or perhaps everyone hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten used to the fact that Windows also has similar commands like &lt;code&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt; to modify folder owners. Of course, if your directories are few in number, you can manually change the owner as well. However, this work computer has domain information added, and I’m not sure whether it’s due to an anomaly in the company&amp;rsquo;s deployed domain or some abnormality in the local system settings. In the user list, I couldn’t find the user used for login, so I finally handled it through command-line processing.  Administrator permissions were used to execute the &lt;code&gt;change_ower.powershell&lt;/code&gt; script.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The potholes in the mini-program development haven’t been filled, and we’ve just dug a new one with &lt;strong&gt;WPF&lt;/strong&gt;. Recently, the company has been experiencing some turbulence, and remote collaboration communication is invariably less efficient than desired. So, we&amp;rsquo;ve taken on the development of client interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;WPF&lt;/code&gt; interface design utilizes many concepts similar to web frontend design, striving to isolate UI design from business logic as much as possible, which is the desired division of labor in internet companies.  Having recently dabbled with Mini Programs, many concepts are universal and made learning relatively easy. These can be considered the &amp;ldquo;way&amp;rdquo; in modern UI design; mastering basic framework concepts makes the path less prone to deviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For readers with previous &lt;code&gt;WinForm&lt;/code&gt; development experience, we recommend reading: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cnblogs.com/zh7791/p/11502696.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF Basic Summary (Learning Suggestions)&lt;/a&gt;. The article isn&amp;rsquo;t too long and is suitable for experienced readers to plan their learning path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For beginners, we recommend reading: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wpfsoft.com/introduction&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF Chinese Website&lt;/a&gt;, which introduces basic concepts, the history of development, and the logic of understanding underlying classes from scratch. This website is quite lucky – it was just released by the author in August this year, aimed at attracting readers to purchase courses, and its timing coincides with mine. If it&amp;rsquo;s a little later, I probably won’t have any chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the most orthodox learning materials, of course, it’s the official Microsoft documentation, which is somewhat dry and requires patience for new readers. Classic e-books are also plentiful, and not particularly recommended. With a lot of work to do daily, there isn’t much time to sit down and read; it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to immediately immerse myself in reading. It’s more suitable to practice projects instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;c-and-net-release-history&#34;&gt;C# and .NET Release History
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding previous learning languages, there have been a number of new features released in recent years, with version updates to the syntax occurring annually.

        <title>The Prelude to Financial Anti-Corruption</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2023 14:53:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: will intensify anti-corruption efforts in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector, and thoroughly rectify “the four prevailing tendencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chinese-communist-party-politburo&#34;&gt;Chinese Communist Party Politburo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on September 27th, reviewing the “Comprehensive Report on the Situation of the First Round of Inspection of the Twelfth Collective Congress.” Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, chaired the meeting. The meeting emphasized that the inspection and oversight work should be used as an opportunity to further strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party of China, encourage inspected party organizations to raise their political stance, conscientiously fulfill the responsibilities and missions assigned by the Central Committee, continuously enhance the core functions and competitiveness of state-owned enterprises, consolidate the important material and political foundations of socialism with Chinese characteristics, intensify the financial sector’s service to the real economy and national strategies, and promote high-quality development. It was stressed that development and security should be coordinated, a bottom-line thinking and extreme thinking approach should be adopted, and effective measures should be taken to prevent and mitigate major risks, firmly safeguard the safety red line. To further advance the comprehensive and strict Party self-discipline towards greater depths, we must consolidate and strengthen the responsibility of Party Committee Secretaries as the primary persons in charge, the “dual-tasks” responsibility of leading members of the Party’s Leading Groups, and the supervisory responsibilities of disciplinary and inspection organizations. We must highlight strengthening oversight of all levels of “principals,” intensify anti-corruption efforts in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector, thoroughly rectify “four prevailing styles,” deepen reform and governance based on cases, promote corruption prevention, elimination, and aversion, and advance the integrated promotion of daring to be corrupt, not being corrupt, and not wanting to be corrupt. We must earnestly implement the Party’s organizational guidelines in the New Era, strengthen leading group construction, personnel talent team building, and grassroots Party organization building. We must comprehensively utilize the results of oversight, deepen reform and improve systems, promote source governance, and facilitate targeted and comprehensive solutions. (Xinhua)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created Major Financial Risks! Former Chairman of China Bank, Liu Liange, has been expelled from the Communist Party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;communist-party-of-china-central-politburo&#34;&gt;Communist Party of China Central Politburo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of China, with approval from the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of China has initiated an investigation into the serious disciplinary and illegal conduct of Liu Liange, former Secretary of the Disciplinary Committee of the People’s Bank of China and Chairman. - Following investigation, Liu Liange abandoned his ideals and beliefs, betrayed his original aspirations and mission, lacked determination and integrity in implementing the Central Committee’s decision-making and deployment, compromised on key issues, and recklessly interfered with credit projects, illegally disbursed loans, causing significant financial risks. He failed to fulfill his responsibilities as a leading body for strict Party discipline, seriously disrupted the political ecology of his unit, privately brought prohibited materials into the country; deliberately resisted organizational review; ignored the spirit of the Central Committee’s Eight-Point Regulation by accepting gifts and presents, entering private clubs, and receiving skiing and tourism arrangements; long-term use of management objects&amp;rsquo; vehicles; failed to report personal matters in accordance with regulations, did not truthfully explain issues when questioned by the organization, shielded unqualified personnel in recruitment and promotion; engaged in illegal commercial activities; illegally interfered with capital lending, privately retained confidential materials; corrupted morals, improper family ethics, neglected supervision and education of relatives; lacked ideological bottom line and abused power, “eating off financial resources” by exploiting his position for personal gain in loan financing, project cooperation, and illegally obtained large sums of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;central-committee-of-the-communist-party-of-china&#34;&gt;Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu Liange seriously violated the Party’s disciplinary rules and regulations, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, work discipline, and lifestyle discipline, constituting a serious violation of Party discipline and involving suspected bribery, illegal loan issuance, and criminal offenses. Furthermore, after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, he did not renounce illicit gains or curb his corrupt practices, which was of severe nature, had a bad influence, and warranted serious handling. In accordance with relevant provisions of the &lt;em&gt;Disciplinary Rules of the Chinese Communist Party&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Administrative Procedure Law for Public Office Personnel&lt;/em&gt;, after deliberation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) convened at its plenary meeting and approval by the CPC Central Committee, a decision was made to expel Liu Liange from the Party; cancel his benefits in accordance with regulations; terminate his eligibility as a delegate to the Twenty-First National Congress of the Communist Party of China; recover his illegally obtained income; and transfer his suspected criminal issues to the Public Prosecutor’s Office for investigation and prosecution, along with related assets. - The former secretary of the Party Committee and chairman of China CITIC Group was dismissed from party membership and public office for serious violations and abuses of power (CCTV News).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and National Supervisory Commission reported that, according to a statement from the Guizhou Provincial Commission for Discipline Investigation and Supervision, Li Zhi Ming, former secretary and chairman of Guizhou Bank, is suspected of seriously violating and abusing his position and is currently under disciplinary investigation and supervision by the Guizhou Provincial Commission for Discipline Investigation and Supervision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-an-eight-year-hiatus-huijin-boosts-holdings-in-the-big-four-banks&#34;&gt;After an Eight-Year Hiatus, Huijin Boosts Holdings in the Big Four Banks
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 11th, Industrial Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and Construction Bank – the four major state-owned commercial banks – respectively announced that Huijin Company had increased its holdings, totaling 276.1 million shares, 372.7 million shares, 248.9 million shares, and 183.8 million shares, respectively. Huijin Company plans to continue increasing its holdings in the Big Four Banks on the secondary market over the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Revenue Generation Business Model: Raffle/Sweepstakes</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/traffic-monetization-business-models-lottery/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 07:04:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/traffic-monetization-business-models-lottery/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Live streamers sending iPhones? Mini-program ranking rewards? Various live streaming platform gift giveaways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three seemingly unrelated items are, in essence, different monetization models for free traffic – a bit like a financial game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;platform-lottery-for-gifts&#34;&gt;Platform Lottery for Gifts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typical scenarios, users reset their acquisition of platform currency and purchase gifts to send to the host, &amp;ldquo;Xin Yi&amp;rdquo; (Hearty), with each platform having another gameplay mechanic. After users acquire platform currency, they no longer directly send gifts but instead spend a certain amount of currency to participate in lottery activities, obtaining limited high-value gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the online lottery is simply understood as the platform opening a casino. With enough participants, it’s guaranteed not to lose money. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;屌丝&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; (literally &amp;ldquo;loser,&amp;rdquo; often used colloquially to describe someone from a lower socioeconomic background) users, fueled by a desire to gamble and win big, hoping to hit a jackpot and then send gifts – gaining face and becoming a “big brother”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;live-stream-gifts-physical-items&#34;&gt;Live Stream Gifts (Physical Items)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lottery mentioned in the preceding text targets users’ own writing. Each month, the hosts have water flow tasks and popularity tasks. The gameplay of enabling gift giveaways allows fans to send specific gifts or gifts of a specified amount, giving them the opportunity to participate in the lottery. The prizes may include high-end phones or cash red envelopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For popular live streamers, this activity is very profitable, essentially equivalent to a temporary zero-cost purchase. If enough people participate, the streamer also makes money. This tests the streamer’s operational capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s also a gameplay where the rewards are very high (cash value), and many outdoor streamers engage in this type of scheme, which is essentially online gambling. The content of the livestream doesn’t matter; users only care about whether they can win. Excluding live streaming hosts of stage performance types, through PK (peer-versus-peer) modes, inducing fans to consume and recharge, ordinary game streamers are difficult to drive player spending sentiment. Playing games and watching live streams are primarily for entertainment and don’t necessarily lead to additional financial expenditure, especially &lt;strong&gt;competitive games&lt;/strong&gt;. Lottery-style mechanisms can cultivate users&amp;rsquo; charging habits, consumption habits, and occasionally even impulsive purchases (giving away a lot, hoping to win).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mini-program-ranking-rewards&#34;&gt;Mini Program Ranking Rewards
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design a mini program that incorporates some useless workflows or provides partial game-related auxiliary services. The preceding items are all cover stories, designed to pass Tencent’s review by adding a ranking mechanism to the mini program&amp;rsquo;s gameplay – incorporating elements like bringing in some pointless processes or offering part-game related assistance. Users earn points by browsing promotional ads and completing tasks, with a leaderboard established in the background based on these points, rewarding users with designated rewards based on their rank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core Logic: Advertising Revenue &amp;gt; Operational Costs + Reward Expenses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mini program can also operate normally by providing reasonable services and earning revenue through appropriate advertising – this may not yield much profit, but it’s like a trickle, and that&amp;rsquo;s acceptable too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>ZeroTier SD</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/zero-tier-remote-lan/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 04:58:03 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/zero-tier-remote-lan/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I recently got a &lt;code&gt;mini&lt;/code&gt; host for the office, thinking it would be convenient to configure an environment and have occasional access at home. I temporarily deployed internal network penetration using &lt;code&gt;frp&lt;/code&gt; – specifying port forwarding, which requires a public server with a connection quality dependent on its bandwidth. Instead, I experimented with a fresh &lt;code&gt;Zerotier&lt;/code&gt; virtual LAN, similar to a &lt;code&gt;VPN&lt;/code&gt;, where I created a virtual network card locally, and all machines joined into that virtual network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-zerotier&#34;&gt;What is ZeroTier
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ZeroTier&lt;/code&gt; is a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) solution that allows users to create secure virtual networks between devices in different geographic locations. Through &lt;code&gt;ZeroTier&lt;/code&gt;, you can easily connect multiple computers, servers, and devices into a virtual, encrypted network – as if they were on the same local network. This can help programmers and IT professionals securely share data and resources across different locations without complex network setups and VPN configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZeroTier Networks&lt;/strong&gt;: A ZeroTier Network is a virtual, global LAN that allows different devices to connect together over the internet, as if they were on the same physical network. This network can contain multiple subnets, with all devices connected together using ZeroTier technology. &lt;strong&gt;Planet Server:&lt;/strong&gt; The Planet Server is a key component of the Zerotier network. It’s global in scope, responsible for maintaining and managing the entire Zerotier network&amp;rsquo;s topology, routing information, and network state. The Planet Server acts as a central control center for the network, but does not directly transmit data. User devices need to connect to at least one Planet Server to participate in the Zerotier network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-zerotier-1&#34;&gt;What is Zerotier
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relay Server:&lt;/strong&gt; A relay server is an auxiliary node within the Zerotier network, used to help devices establish direct communication channels. When devices cannot connect directly, they can use a relay server to transmit data. This helps improve network reachability and performance. Relay servers are typically located around the globe, acting as data transmission hubs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, Zerotier utilizes the assistance of planet servers and relay servers to enable devices to create virtual local networks globally, facilitating secure and fast communication between devices. The planet server is responsible for global network management, while the relay server helps establish connection links when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation--deployment&#34;&gt;Installation &amp;amp; Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the ZeroTier official website (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zerotier.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.zerotier.com/&lt;/a&gt;) to obtain installation files and documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install the ZeroTier One client according to your operating system. It supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and many other platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch the ZeroTier One client after installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register a ZeroTier account if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have one. You can create an account within the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in with your ZeroTier account and create a new network. The network will have a unique 16-character ID, which you need to remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join this network on your device. You can either enter the network ID in the client or use the QR code scanning feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devices with the installed and configured ZeroTier client will be added to the same virtual network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation-and-deployment-of-moon&#34;&gt;Installation and Deployment of Moon
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many domestic operators have banned UDP tunneling, and the frp service is stable due to using the TCP protocol. Zerotier deployment can also achieve similar effects by deploying a relay server, requiring firewall opening of UDP port 9993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify installation success
Join the local network
Create &lt;code&gt;moon&lt;/code&gt;
Edit the configuration file, adjust the &lt;code&gt;stableEndpoints&lt;/code&gt; nodes to &amp;ldquo;server public IP/9993&amp;rdquo;
Generate signature configurations, create the &lt;code&gt;moons.d&lt;/code&gt; folder, and move the previous files into it; restart the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client nodes join the moon server, taking the ID from the JSON configuration file&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Windows platforms, launch the terminal with administrator privileges and operate using the zerotier-cli.bat command-line tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Linux platforms, operate using the zerotier-cli tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;peers&lt;/code&gt; subcommand to view connections, and &lt;code&gt;listpeers&lt;/code&gt; to view all nodes. Normal display of the &lt;code&gt;moon&lt;/code&gt; node indicates successful joining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uninstalling&#34;&gt;Uninstalling
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to uninstall on the &lt;code&gt;Windows&lt;/code&gt; platform is beyond the scope of this document, as it follows standard operating procedures – typically through the Control Panel. We will focus on &lt;code&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the zerotier-one service using dpkg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete the zerotier-one folder, which stores the address information; deleting it will result in a new address being generated upon reinstallation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were originally all decommissioned, arriving at the server location without suitable service nodes to act as proxy servers. Alibaba was focused on sales and provided development trial servers with low configurations, costing only 99 yuan per year and used for two years. The key factor was the bandwidth offered by the servers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>VMware Virtual Machine Disk Space Optimization</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-disk-space-optimization/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:35:41 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-disk-space-optimization/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When installing a development system with VMware virtual machines, it’s generally recommended to pre-allocate a significant amount of disk space. Over time, the local disk space consumed by the VM will far exceed the actual size of the files contained within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scenario-description&#34;&gt;Scenario Description
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;df -h&lt;/code&gt; command revealed that the current machine was using 60GB of disk space, and after deleting all snapshots and clone images, the local virtual machine still occupied significantly more than 60GB, further straining the already limited hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34;&gt;Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When installing the virtual machine, do not select &amp;ldquo;pre-allocate disk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The local storage drive for the virtual machine must have sufficient free disk space greater than the currently used space of the VM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is insufficient space, consider temporarily moving the VM to an external hard drive, optimize the disk, and then migrate it back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official provides the &lt;code&gt;open-vm-tools&lt;/code&gt; package, which can be installed via yum or by installing the VMware-Tools image package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;commands&#34;&gt;Commands
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After execution, the virtual machine will automatically shut down. The VMware host program will perform disk compression, and the execution time depends on the volume of the virtual machine and the speed of disk access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect is quite good; the disk space occupied by the virtual machine is essentially equal to the disk information obtained from &lt;code&gt;df -h&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stable Diffusion – The Love, Hate, and Drama of Installing it from Scratch</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/stable-diffusion-zero-install-saga/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 00:23:54 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/stable-diffusion-zero-install-saga/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Domestic resources are basically all recommending &lt;strong&gt;Autumn Leaf&lt;/strong&gt;’s one-click deployment package, thinking that they are open-source projects based on &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;, so the deployment wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be very complicated, let’s try to start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was messing around with AI-generated images and specifically changed my graphics card, a beginner version of the &lt;code&gt;3060 12g&lt;/code&gt;; the venerable &lt;code&gt;960&lt;/code&gt; served its seven years and retired in glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core &lt;code&gt;pytorch cuda&lt;/code&gt; installation, which I previously encountered issues with when writing Python game helper scripts (I had installed it locally before), still presented problems – the &lt;code&gt;cuda&lt;/code&gt; encryption consistently failed to activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;to-do&#34;&gt;To Do
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replan the article structure, first introduce PyTorch, version correspondence, and how to check versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to create a new virtual environment from scratch locally and deploy PyTorch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate the manuscript from scratch: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stable-diffusion-art.com/install-windows/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://stable-diffusion-art.com/install-windows/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize reference materials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps&#34;&gt;Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step-by-step installation tutorials in Chinese may not be readily available. When you search in English on &lt;code&gt;Google&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll find many similar tutorials starting from scratch. We introduce the need to install &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and then explain the need to install &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;. Then, you go ahead and download the repository – simply double-clicking the script gets it running.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t know why no one explains what this repository is for. In fact, the name itself makes it pretty clear – it&amp;rsquo;s a graphical console that makes it easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The repository also created an installation and startup script. It automatically identifies the current folder and checks for a &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; virtual environment. If one exists, it defaults to using the &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; in the current path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t follow their steps directly to launch the script. Python uses &lt;code&gt;requirement&lt;/code&gt; files to install dependency libraries – this is just a minor issue. The core thing is your GPU version and driver version, which need to match PyTorch. Many people have discussed the corresponding relationship online; you can find it by searching.
Reference: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40660408/article/details/129896700&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a virtual environment is like creating an empty virtual environment, where you first execute the official script to install PyTorch within it.
You can use the above two scripts to check the CUDA version you need to install and also verify whether the installation was successful. - It’s not recommended to use fancy operations here. First, copy over according to the logic of the official page, and then just install it directly. Using pip to install will likely fail or won&amp;rsquo;t activate CUDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key point is that don’t put random characters in your folder paths, as this could prevent PyTorch from working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pytorch-1&#34;&gt;PyTorch
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went through a lot of trial and error installing it repeatedly, even trying to download the official installation files and manually install them. I was hoping to upgrade to version 2.0 because the official documentation said it would be faster. However, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used it much before, and I wasn’t sure about the impact of Python versions on it. In between, I also reviewed the official documentation, which recommended using version 3.8. This created a small conflict since I had previously used a one-click installation package that included version 3.10. Finally, I started from scratch by creating a new folder and a virtual environment to ensure that PyTorch was installed successfully. Then, I moved this installed virtual environment into the web UI folder. At that point, when running the script to install the other dependencies, all the dependency issues were resolved. Afterwards, you need to execute: &lt;code&gt;python -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall pip&lt;/code&gt; to fix pip. It might seem a bit strange, but I’ve spent quite a while troubleshooting this. I realized it couldn&amp;rsquo;t correctly identify my torch, so I thought it best to install it first before installing other dependency libraries to eliminate all potential interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;xformers&#34;&gt;Xformers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to enable this, which can accelerate image generation and reduce memory usage. However, a side effect is that &lt;strong&gt;generated images tend to be less stable&lt;/strong&gt; with the same set of parameters.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn’t recommend the one-click deployment package because it contained some settings that were customized by the author and differed from the official, out-of-the-box configuration. If you&amp;rsquo;re a beginner, you might not understand why those parameters are optimal; it’s best to start with the official package first. As you use it more and more, take time to read the official documentation, and you’ll learn which parameters need adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;choosing-a-graphics-card&#34;&gt;Choosing a Graphics Card
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the cryptocurrency mining boom, graphics card prices have become relatively more reasonable. When choosing between the RTX 3060 and RTX 3060 Ti for entry-level players, it’s generally recommended to opt for the version with larger VRAM – specifically the ‘12G’ models. This is because they can generate images at higher resolutions. Why do you need a higher resolution? Because you can adjust the resolution during generation, resulting in clearer and more detailed images. If you&amp;rsquo;re primarily generating smaller images, then 8GB of VRAM will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the &lt;strong&gt;Super Resolution Upscaling&lt;/strong&gt; option, which enhances details and makes the image richer. This feature also requires more VRAM. Here’s a summary table of the single-precision (FP32), half-precision (FP16), and double-precision (FP64) floating-point compute capabilities for NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970, GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, GeForce RTX 3060, GeForce RTX 3080, and GeForce RTX 3080 Ti:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every six months, I originally planned to revisit and refine the installation steps, and explain more basic concepts. However, I discovered that most people using AI image generation are simply adjusting parameters based on images provided by experts, or re-rendering existing images with formatting changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had previously attempted a project using AI to generate UI assets for mini programs, but after struggling for half a day, the results were unsatisfactory compared to just pulling resource images directly from the official mini program documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Program optimization should not attempt to fight against hardware.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/program-optimization-dont-fight-hardware/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 16:30:15 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/program-optimization-dont-fight-hardware/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;one loop thread&lt;/code&gt;, the time has already been at the &lt;strong&gt;microsecond&lt;/strong&gt; level, changing servers from a maximum of six ten thousand packets accumulated to almost none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In single-threaded looping scenarios processing data, CPU performance depends on factors such as clock frequency, cache size, and instruction set architecture. Generally, CPUs with higher clock frequencies, larger caches, and more advanced instruction set architectures perform better in single-threaded data processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;single-threaded&#34;&gt;Single-Threaded
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance improvements aren’t always achieved by adding threads; it’s not necessary to overcomplicate things.  Refine the project workflow, identify time-consuming bottlenecks, and determine if a single thread can meet the requirements. Considering single-threaded approaches reduces complexity and minimizes potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat misguided to jump straight into suggesting threading – it tends to be a bit of an overreaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;events&#34;&gt;Events
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handling &lt;strong&gt;market data, latency-sensitive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent the night working diligently to release a new optimized version, performing local API stripping for testing, and the speed was acceptable: tps: 42,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon deployment to the server, the TPS dropped dramatically to: 21,000.  I went home to try it on my desktop, resulting in: tps: 79,000. This led me to suspect that our internal service virtual machines might be experiencing some issues. Initially, I suspected CPU frequency differences between the server and my desktop. The biggest difference was the CPU frequency – the desktop had a higher frequency than the test server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test Server A
Test Server B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consulting-openai&#34;&gt;Consulting OpenAI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the core count and base frequency. The Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4807 @ 1.87GHz has 6 physical cores and 12 logical cores with a base frequency of 1.87GHz; while the Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 v3 @ 2.60GHz has 8 physical cores and 16 logical cores with a base frequency of 2.60GHz. Therefore, from the perspective of core count and base frequency, the E5-2640 v3 should be more advantageous in single-threaded data processing compared to the E7-4807.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, regarding cache size, the E7-4807 has a cache size of 12MB, while the E5-2640 v3 has a cache size of 20MB. Consequently, the E5-2640 v3 possesses a larger cache space, which can improve data access speed and cache hit rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, concerning architecture, the E5-2640 v3 utilizes a more advanced Haswell architecture, while the E7-4807 employs an older Nehalem architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consulting-openai-1&#34;&gt;Consulting OpenAI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, considering the overall factors, in a single-threaded loop processing data scenarios, the E5-2640 v3 should outperform the E7-4807. However, specific performance differences will be influenced by various factors including data processing algorithms, memory bandwidth, system load, and so on, requiring analysis based on the specific problem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prompt Engineer</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/prompt-engineer/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2023 20:46:53 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/prompt-engineer/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as we needed to learn the techniques of searching engines back then, we also need to learn some techniques for communicating with &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, providing reasonable and sufficient constraints, and efficiently obtaining the answers we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at it from a different angle, current &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; is like a very good student with excellent memory – it has the ability to memorize everything. What we need to do is learn how to communicate with &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; correctly, effectively, and precisely describe our needs to help &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; generate the expected results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##科普
The incredibly popular &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; – specifically &lt;code&gt;Generative Pre-Training&lt;/code&gt; – literally translates to generative pre-training. It’s a deep learning model that trains text generation based on internet-available data, used for tasks like question answering, text summarization generation, machine translation, classification, code generation, and conversational AI. Currently, there have been various versions of models such as GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4, each larger and more powerful than the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-it-really-have-intelligence&#34;&gt;Does it Really Have Intelligence?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarity is high, accuracy increases accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic, repetitive tasks, after specific training, no longer require human intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is a technology that utilizes existing data such as text, audio, and images to create new content. It can be used for various tasks including text generation, speech synthesis, image generation, and dialogue systems. The logical reasoning of Generative AI depends on its training data and model structure. Generally, Generative AI can follow grammar, logic, and common sense to a certain extent, but it may also produce errors, biases, or unrealistic content. Therefore, the output of Generative AI requires human judgment and verification; it should not be blindly trusted or used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt-engineer&#34;&gt;Prompt Engineer
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time flows only forward, and people need to learn to adapt to the current. You can think of &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; as not intelligent, lacking logic, and often producing unusable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you shift your perspective, the current &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; is like a child with excellent memory – it has the ability to memorize after reading something repeatedly, much like copying homework. What we need to do is learn how to communicate correctly, effectively, and with &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, precisely describing our needs to help &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; generate the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dialogue-patterns&#34;&gt;Dialogue Patterns
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, when GitHub Copilot was released, no one could have imagined that two years later, OpenAI would appear out of nowhere, allowing humans to recognize the capabilities of large language models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;strong&gt;comment-based programming&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;conversational programming&lt;/strong&gt;, the interaction logic is completely different. The dialogue pattern offers a user-friendly experience for novice users, and it’s essential to mention NewBing providing follow-up prompts after each question. Microsoft is attempting to guide users to obtain more content from the AI knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-illustrate-with-an-example&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s illustrate with an example
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario:&lt;/strong&gt; A long high-speed train journey, and coding is a good choice. With limited traffic, processing a few images, obtaining image materials, downloading software to process the images is a bit extravagant, and network conditions aren’t ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a batch of image materials with transparent backgrounds that need to be used as navigation bars for small programs. The selected state is colored, and the unselected state is black and white. The materials are all in color, and they need to be preprocessed. &lt;strong&gt;Prompt:&lt;/strong&gt; Write a Python code to read all images from a folder, convert them to black and white while maintaining the transparent background, optimize image quality, reduce file size, and display the before-and-after file size comparison in the console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; quickly provided an answer that looked very beautiful and worked well; an experienced programming source would find the code less generic and unable to be deployed into production:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parameters were fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were no log files, all information was printed to the console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The image processing task was suitable for a multi-threaded model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NewBing&lt;/code&gt; appeared, based on the prompt, choosing a question: &lt;strong&gt;What improvements can be made to this code?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the answer was honest and completely exceeded expectations; typical optimization measures that programmers would think of were all provided by &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, and corresponding suggestions were given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friendly response was given, considering there are differences in the deployment environment, it allowed for not supporting multi-processes. ## Let&amp;rsquo;s illustrate with an example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario:&lt;/strong&gt; A long high-speed train journey, coding is a good choice. With limited traffic, processing a few images, obtaining image materials, downloading software to process the images is a bit extravagant, and network conditions aren’t ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a batch of image materials with transparent backgrounds intended for use as navigation bars in small programs. The selected state is colored, and the unselected state is black and white. The materials are all in color, and they need to be preprocessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to local development being on a &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; system, the first answer given by &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; did not include the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function and lacked &lt;code&gt;multiprocessing.freeze_support&lt;/code&gt;. The code was fixed after following up and encountering an error.
Just as learning search engine techniques required effort, we also need to learn how to communicate with &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt;, providing reasonable and sufficient constraints to efficiently obtain the desired answers.
Note: &lt;strong&gt;If you are a programming beginner, if you still don&amp;rsquo;t understand certain parts of the code based on the given comments, please continue to ask related questions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WeChat Mini Program Background and Development Environment</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wechat-mini-program-background-and-development-environment/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 21:59:11 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/wechat-mini-program-background-and-development-environment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;WeChat Mini Program Introduction and Development Preparation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-mini-programs-exist&#34;&gt;Why Mini Programs Exist
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; Slow web loading and blank screens; native app experience with faster loading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standards &amp;amp; Management:&lt;/strong&gt; For WeChat, onboarding and management
Before mini programs were released, WeChat published an SDK called &lt;code&gt;Jssdk&lt;/code&gt;, which opened up parts of the original WeChat capabilities: WeChat Pay, coupons. However, developers used web development languages to develop logic, bypassing some WeChat regulations. Mini Programs have their own description language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-mini-programs&#34;&gt;What are Mini Programs?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mini programs are applications that can be used without needing to download and install them. They realize the dream of having applications &lt;strong&gt;within easy reach&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can open an application simply by scanning a QR code or searching for it. This also reflects the concept of &lt;strong&gt;use-it-and-leave-it&lt;/strong&gt; – users don’t have to worry about installing too many apps. Applications will be ubiquitous and available at any time, but they &lt;strong&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t require installation or uninstallation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;differences-between-mini-programs-and-mobile-applications&#34;&gt;Differences Between Mini Programs and Mobile Applications
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No installation required, doesn&amp;rsquo;t occupy memory, easy to spread: QR code scanning, mini program cards, Search One Search (Sohu Search)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-mini-programs-can-do&#34;&gt;What Mini Programs Can Do
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content Tools: Zhihu Hot Rankings, Weibo Hot Topics, Mobike Bikes, Today Headline, Tencent Maps, Tencent Translate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail: Pinduoduo, JD.com Shopping, Mugujie, Daily Fresh, Xiaomi Mall, Watsons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games: Jump Rope, Happy Mahjong, Happy Mahjong, Douyu Live Streaming, YY Live Streaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Course content is from 2018; some application vendors have already gone bankrupt now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;development-preparation&#34;&gt;Development Preparation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register a Mini Program Account: Simply fill in the information normally, and click the activation link on the email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log into the Mini Program Management Backstage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete Mini Program Information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bind Developer: For individual developers, use the WeChat account you’re logged in with as the administrator account; no additional binding is required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email has certain restrictions – it needs a new email, but you can apply aliases for QQ emails, and the WeChat background will not verify them. After trying this, the name of the mini program is quite troublesome. As soon as it involves trademarks, it’s prone to audit failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can select service categories and also add custom ones; a Mini Program can add five categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Settings, you can view the Mini Program&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;ID&lt;/code&gt; information and enable message push; with message push enabled, you can use the Message Template function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;developer-tools-as-described-by-the-author&#34;&gt;Developer Tools (as described by the author)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal download and installation, with no special considerations – just a basic understanding. Simply enter in Guest Mode, and if you want to enable mobile debugging (i.e., view the mini-program development version on your phone), you need to log into the mini-program developer account, then click Settings, and switch to the specified mini-program’s &lt;code&gt;ID&lt;/code&gt; within Project Details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-structure&#34;&gt;Code Structure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;js: Interaction logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;json: Data configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wxml: UI elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wxss: UI styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;migration&#34;&gt;Migration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closing up shop, packing everything away, a familiar route, a new workstation – adjusting computer cabling, finding a comfortable posture to start working.
(ÒωÓױ)! – Connecting the network cable, accessing the frequently used servers for the team, but they were inaccessible. I tried switching to wireless networking, and access was normal again. Initially, I thought it was a problem with the server’s IP address settings, the wired network at the new workstation wasn&amp;rsquo;t included in the firewall configuration, so adjusting it resolved the issue; this subnet isn’t just one server – when trying to access other servers, they were all working normally. Gradually, confusion arose? Let professional people handle professional matters, and finally, a colleague from the operations department pinpointed the cause: This server was deployed with &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;, and the default network of the &lt;code&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; service conflicted with the wired network configuration of the office, causing data packets sent to it to not receive responses and being routed to the &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; service. Other servers didn’t deploy &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; services, so I use this one more frequently. Occasionally, I use containers to deploy some test services, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to encounter this scenario. Looking back, considering the entire group is located in a single office building, it’s not strange that IT colleagues divided network segments using addresses starting with &lt;code&gt;172&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker0&#34;&gt;docker0
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restart the service, switch to a new network, and the server recovers normal access.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Embedded Systems – Getting Started Part 1 – Technical Terms</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/embedded-introduction-professional-terms/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 13:42:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/embedded-introduction-professional-terms/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation of the provided text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I think of embedded systems, my mind immediately goes back to the 51-pin single-chip microcomputers and Texas Instruments we used in university labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LPA3399Pro is a visual host developed on the HiSilicon RK3399Pro platform, designed for portable computing hosts that require extensive visual processing. It features an integrated NPU (Neural Processing Unit) with 3.0 TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second) of compute power and supports various algorithm models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RV1109 is HiSilicon’s SoC (System on Chip) within its machine vision branch of artificial intelligence, featuring a dedicated NPU. RV1109 provides 1TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second) of compute power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;system-on-chip&#34;&gt;System on Chip
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoC is an abbreviation for System on a Chip, meaning “system on a chip.” It’s a technology that integrates multiple electronic systems onto a single chip. This technology can significantly reduce the size and weight of electronic products while simultaneously improving performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoC (System on a Chip) and CPU (Central Processing Unit) are both important components of computer systems, but they have some differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPU is the core processor in a computer system, responsible for executing program instructions. It typically only contains basic components such as arithmetic logic units, control units, and registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoC, on the other hand, integrates multiple electronic systems onto a single chip, including a CPU, as well as other components such as memory, graphics processors, and input/output interfaces. This can significantly reduce the size and weight of electronic products while simultaneously improving performance and reducing power consumption. In essence, a CPU is a component of an SoC, while an SoC is a more complex and highly integrated electronic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;microcontroller-unit&#34;&gt;Microcontroller Unit
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoC (System on a Chip) and MCU (Microcontroller Unit) are technologies that integrate multiple electronic systems onto a single chip, but there are also some differences between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MCU is a microcontroller, typically containing a CPU, memory, input/output interfaces, and other basic components. It’s commonly used to control other electronic devices, such as household appliances and automotive electronics systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An SoC, on the other hand, integrates more electronic systems onto a single chip, in addition to the basic components of an MCU, it can also integrate other components like graphics processors and wireless communication modules. This significantly reduces the size and weight of electronic products while improving performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, an MCU is a simple microcontroller, whereas an SoC is a more complex and highly integrated electronic system.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AI-assisted programming, the evolution of productivity</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-assisted-programming-productivity-evolution/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 17:05:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-assisted-programming-productivity-evolution/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“GitHub Copilot” was released less than two years ago, and “ChatGPT” appeared shortly after. I don’t fully understand the underlying principles, but I&amp;rsquo;ve used them for a while. The two tools differ completely in their level of assistance, but they have both significantly increased productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For things that are too complex, AI still can’t do it – after all, they lack logic, or operate on established patterns or fixed frameworks. If the training data is sufficient, AI can achieve nine out of ten results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-copilot&#34;&gt;GitHub Copilot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When released, the demo on the official website wasn&amp;rsquo;t very smart, so I tried it and didn’t find it useful, so I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 2022, when I had some free time, I switched to the new version to try it out, and the effect was already quite good; however, the speed in China was a bit slow, which was probably due to network issues. For languages like &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;, the code generated based on comments was pretty good, and much faster than researching and writing code myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chatgpt&#34;&gt;ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Github Copilot&lt;/code&gt; still focuses on developers, i.e., from a development perspective when designing the product. You need to understand how to program and gradually guide AI assistance through comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt; has moved to the next level, &lt;strong&gt;allowing non-programmers to quickly get started&lt;/strong&gt;. The conversational chat interface design allows you to simply ask questions, describe requirements, and ask for clarification if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a simple example: You know about tokenization but don’t know how to code it; you want to calculate the similarity of strings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, this is Bing. 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on online information 123, Python tokenization can be implemented using the jieba library. The jieba library supports three tokenization modes: precise mode, full mode, and search engine mode. You can choose the appropriate mode based on your needs. To compare the similarity of two strings, you first need to tokenize them and then calculate their word vectors or edit distance metrics. You can use libraries like NumPy or SciPy for mathematical operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To standardize string processing, convert English strings to lowercase using Python&amp;rsquo;s built-in &lt;code&gt;lower()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To slice the second string, you can use Python’s slicing operator [].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a possible code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chatgpt-1&#34;&gt;ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going Further – Consult the Execution Results. Congratulations, you’ve identified an issue! The result was hallucinated; it did not actually run the code, but will provide a good-looking response.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question: SQL statement to retrieve records from the product code table where the product code falls within the range 80000-89999.
Follow-up question: Negate it: The product code is a string, your code is wrong.
Congratulations, it will misidentify.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) announced on December 13th that it will soon launch the “Hong Kong Dollar-Renminbi Dual-Listing Mode” (hereinafter referred to as “Dual-Listing Mode”) and dual-listing broker mechanisms for its securities markets, further supporting RMB-designated listings, trading, and settlement in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dual-listing-model-and-dual-listing-dealer-mechanism&#34;&gt;Dual-Listing Model and Dual-Listing Dealer Mechanism
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) stated that the registration process for these new measures is expected to commence in the first half of 2023, pending regulatory approval and market readiness. Under the dual-listing model, HKEX will optimize related trading and settlement arrangements, allowing investors to swap securities issued by the same issuer in both Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) and Renminbi (RMB) trading venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance liquidity of the RMB trading venue and narrow the price gap between the two venues, HKEX will introduce a dual-listing dealer mechanism. Once relevant legislation is passed by the Legislative Council, market dealers engaged in providing quoted liquidity will be exempt from stamp duty when conducting specific transactions. Simultaneously, these new measures will also prepare for subsequent mainland investors to trade securities priced in RMB through the Hong Kong Connect trading scheme. “The launch of the Hong Kong-Renminbi (RMB) dual currency clearing arrangement and the dual currency dealing mechanism for institutional investors is a key measure to support market development. In conjunction with our other market initiatives, this arrangement will help attract more dual currency securities listed in Hong Kong and leverage synergies with existing Mainland products on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. ‘The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) is committed to actively promoting the internationalization of RMB and continuously enhancing Hong Kong’s position as a leading offshore RMB center globally,’ said Mr. Yao Kai-yan, Chief Operating Officer and Head of Market Liaison. It is noted that the current listing, trading, settlement and clearing arrangements in the Hong Kong stock market will largely apply to RMB clearing securities under the dual currency clearing arrangement. HKEX will announce the implementation date of the dual currency clearing model and the list of eligible dual currency securities included in the institutional investor mechanism at an appropriate time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-identify-hong-kong-dollar-renminbi-trading-booths&#34;&gt;How to Identify Hong Kong Dollar-Renminbi Trading Booths
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchange documents show that the Hong Kong dollar-Renminbi dual listing arrangement will largely follow the existing stock code allocation plan, namely that stocks on the Hong Kong dollar booth will have 5-digit stock codes starting with “0,” while stocks on the Renminbi booth will have 5-digit stock codes starting with “8.” The last four digits of stock codes for both the Hong Kong dollar and Renminbi booths will be identical. The short names of stocks on the Renminbi booth will be appended with &amp;ldquo;-R.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding trading arrangements, based on securities that are the same category and can be converted between the Renminbi and Hong Kong dollar booths, if one booth (such as the Hong Kong dollar booth) is a designated security that can be shorted, the other booth (such as the Renminbi booth) can also be included as a designated security that can be shorted in accordance with exchange rules. Correspondingly, both booths will appear on the list of designated securities that can be shorted published by the exchange. Given that the stocks on two trading desks belong to the same category and can be mutually converted, buying or holding them in Hong Kong dollars and selling them in Renminbi will be treated as shorting the position, and vice versa. The settlement time between the two desks is T+2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For designated stocks eligible for short selling, such as borrowing shares in Hong Kong dollars and then selling them on the Renminbi desk, this will be considered secured short selling, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that under the dual-desk model, since the Renminbi desk is only for trading and settlement, it will not provide physical stock deposits or withdrawals; physical stocks can only be deposited after being converted to the Renminbi desk, and similarly, the Renminbi desk must be converted to the Hong Kong dollar desk before physical stocks can be withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-identify-hong-kong-dollar-renminbi-trading-service-desks&#34;&gt;How to Identify Hong Kong Dollar-Renminbi Trading Service Desks
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fees associated with related settlement and clearing of transactions, all Hong Kong settlement fees (excluding dividend collection service fee and interest collection service fee), are calculated and charged in Hong Kong Dollars. Dividend collection service fee and interest collection service fee are calculated in the eligible currency used by the relevant securities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>- Compiler
- Callback Function
- Performance Testing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/compiler-callback-function-performance-testing/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 13:59:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/compiler-callback-function-performance-testing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last year, an SDK was designed to handle encapsulating certain events and provide a class interface externally. During service initialization, the caller implements the corresponding classes and passes the object pointer to the module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with C11 piqued my curiosity, leading me to explore what would happen if these interfaces were implemented using lambda function objects instead of the traditional pure virtual function definition method. Compared to the latter, it seemed more flexible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The question arose: with two different syntaxes, which one would be faster from a performance perspective? Not understanding compiler principles, I decided to try out some code to find out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online website, allowing you to select different compilers, compilation parameters, run code on the &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt; platform, or view corresponding assembly code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wandbox.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://wandbox.org/&lt;/a&gt; : Sometimes useful for technical validation; executing small code snippets in a web browser is very convenient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://godbolt.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://godbolt.org/&lt;/a&gt; : Using different colors to distinguish the corresponding assembly code for each line, it’s more convenient than using a local debugger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;body&#34;&gt;Body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Standards Committee established grammatical rules, and how these are implemented at the compilation level depends on each compiler vendor. It’s worth noting here that Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s compiler is quite powerful. Syntactic sugar isn’t a panacea; callback interfaces aren’t abundant, using &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; expressions is more convenient and eliminates the need to define empty callback function interfaces. When callback interfaces become numerous, traditional virtual functions are advantageous for unifying business interface definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; platform, performance is nearly identical, with little difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt; platform, a comparison of virtual functions versus &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; reveals a 1.35ns overhead in one instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In typical business system development, this level of performance degradation can be ignored; introducing &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; brings greater convenience to the design. This is particularly noticeable when dealing with multi-signal processing, where underlying event triggers are used, and the handling functions for logging objects entering and exiting the system. When more business processing interfaces are needed, the underlying layer uses &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; to store &lt;code&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; objects. When an event is triggered, it iterates through them sequentially and calls them one by one, similar to Qt&amp;rsquo;s signals and slots. Logging, monitoring, Business 1, and Business 2 are completely decoupled from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code&#34;&gt;Code
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While researching, I came across similar code snippets &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benloong/8050171/raw/fa577ec923b460862078b8b40233a42a1c619eeb/functionperformance.cpp&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;functionperformance.cpp&lt;/a&gt;.
It included two additional modes: regular functions and functors, providing an interface callback approach and direct call comparison. The performance loss was a difference of orders of magnitude, with functors performing close to functions, sometimes even outperforming them.  The compilation principles were a knowledge blind spot for me; I suspected it was due to the access of variable addresses being adjacent to the function, which would benefit &lt;code&gt;CPU&lt;/code&gt; processing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve included the results from running in &lt;code&gt;wandbox&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Host byte, network byte, observe directly through debugger</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/host-order-network-order-debugger-observation/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 14:18:12 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/host-order-network-order-debugger-observation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout the history of computer development, there has been no unified standard for data storage. There are two commonly used rules for byte arrangement. For example, if the low-order bits of a multi-digit number are placed at smaller addresses and the high-order bits are placed at larger addresses, it is referred to as little-endian; conversely, it is called big-endian. In network applications, byte order is a factor that must be considered because different types of machines may adopt different standards, so they are all converted according to the network standard.
According to reading habits, big-endian byte order is more consistent with the left-to-right reading order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;processor-architecturehttpszhwikipediaorgwikie5ad97e88a82e5ba8f&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AD%97%E8%8A%82%E5%BA%8F&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Processor Architecture&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processors such as x86, MOS Technology 6502, Z80, VAX, and PDP-11 use little-endian byte order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processors like Motorola 6800, Motorola 68000, PowerPC 970 use big-endian byte order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The byte order of processors such as ARM, PowerPC (excluding PowerPC 970), DEC Alpha, SPARC V9, MIPS, PA-RISC and IA64 is configurable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;network-byte-order&#34;&gt;Network Byte Order
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network transmission generally uses big-endian order, also known as network byte order or network order. The IP protocol defines big-endian as the network byte order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Berkeley&lt;/code&gt; sockets API defined a set of conversion functions to convert 16 and 32-bit integers between network byte order and host byte order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If using &lt;code&gt;asio&lt;/code&gt; as a networking library, its internal namespaces contain cross-platform adapted function names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::host_to_network_long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::host_to_network_short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio-debugger&#34;&gt;Visual Studio Debugger
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In debugging mode, select the Debug menu, Window, and checkmark the Memory window.  Within &lt;code&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/code&gt;, you can directly view data in memory using the debugger, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/host-network-byte-order-debugger/Snipaste_2023-01-10_14-44-00.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ways-to-view-memory&#34;&gt;Ways to View Memory
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The window directly outputs &amp;amp;variable name and jumps to the corresponding variable address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the variable is originally a pointer, double-click on the variable to select it and drag it to the memory window to display the content at the corresponding address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the variable is not a pointer, add it to the calculation window to obtain its address, then manually copy it to the memory window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lets-illustrate-with-an-example&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s illustrate with an example
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receive a piece of data and store it in the &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt; object, convert network byte order to host byte order, resulting in &lt;code&gt;body_length&lt;/code&gt; being equal to 30. The server allocates four bytes for transmitting this data.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Back then, as a young boy, he might have had talent, but it wasn’t common.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/then-boy-talent-not-much/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 13:45:09 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/then-boy-talent-not-much/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s my seventh year in the job, and I’m not getting as much positive feedback on the code I write. Let me reflect on how I ended up on this &lt;code&gt;coding&lt;/code&gt; path. People’s choices, especially when they&amp;rsquo;re younger, tend to follow positive reinforcement more closely – actively avoiding harm and seeking benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-childhood&#34;&gt;I. Childhood
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving to the city and coming into contact with computer books? Hacker’s materials? Meeting Windows systems – these are all anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The time should be positioned around childhood and sneaking around with my cousin to play games on our parents&amp;rsquo; computers&lt;/strong&gt;, my cousin and I’s uncle ran a shop in a computer store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been exposed to computers from a young age, and the basic understanding was established. Later, in school, taking microcomputer courses also sparked an interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In middle school, I heard about computer competitions, which seemed really cool, but after transferring schools, this fell by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my junior high years, I was familiar with the basics of computer operation, and I could easily be the center of attention in microcomputer classes. If you’re still familiar, yes, you haven&amp;rsquo;t made a mistake – being proficient in office software is even more impressive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-moving--relocation&#34;&gt;II. Moving / Relocation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit the moving situation. When we moved to the city center, due to the neighbors, we came into contact with the library. Although we read quite a few novels, we also read many magazines, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computer News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;大众软件&lt;/em&gt; (Greatest Software)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We became increasingly interested in computers as a product. The childhood admiration for hackers was very active, and we proactively sought out relevant knowledge at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned the basics of operating systems: control panel, CMD commands, VBS scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computer News&lt;/em&gt; is suitable for beginners; each time it presents information in the form of case studies, explaining system operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greatest Software&lt;/em&gt; recommends various software, industry news, and &lt;strong&gt;of course, game news – this was initially our motivation, and it planted the seed for gaming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-high-school&#34;&gt;III. High School
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, Bo Ge transferred to our class, and &lt;strong&gt;in the previous two years, he secured several predecessors as direct qualifiers for the computer competition&lt;/strong&gt;, which was highly valued by the school leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a foundational hardware base, with an alumnus from America donating a building that became the new library and new computer lab – it all felt incredibly coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with Bo Ge’s popular science education, he was essentially the go-to guy for computers in our class at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scholar + computer master, knew how to hack into other people&amp;rsquo;s computers and disable the classroom surveillance software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-high-school-1&#34;&gt;III. High School
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competitions were bumpy and ultimately ended in the finals, where I didn’t quite understand the material and the questions were mostly basic algorithms. However, it was still a worthwhile experience – like taking a short trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-university-arrived--university-major-selection-following-parental-guidance-choosing-automation-actually-wanted-to-pursue-power-electronics-intending-to-join-the-local-electricity-bureau-upon-graduation-little-coursework-was-studied-self-driven-learning-ability-was-virtually-nonexistent-in-professional-courses-computer-courses-within-large-courses-were-very-easy-to-learn-attended-class-regularly-while-skipping-professional-classes-and-diligently-studying-computer-courses-spent-daily-time-on-forums-jingyi-forum-i-love-crack-combining-what-little-assembly-and-c-knowledge-was-learned-from-the-forums-to-take-on-line-orders-for-profit-receiving-increasingly-positive-feedback-and-gradually-became-more-involved--unable-to-be-pulled-back-eventually-choosing-a-niche-profession--writing-code-for-chips--the-family-didnt-pay-much-attention-allowing-me-to-choose-it-myself-at-this-time-the-third-key-figure-my-cousin--high-education-working-at-baidu-grandma-also-understood-me-knowing-that-i-hadnt-been-focused-on-research-since-a-young-age-so-i-talked-to-him-about-it&#34;&gt;Four. University Arrived – University Major Selection, Following Parental Guidance, Choosing Automation; Actually Wanted to Pursue Power Electronics, Intending to Join the Local Electricity Bureau Upon Graduation. Little Coursework Was Studied, Self-Driven Learning Ability Was Virtually Nonexistent in Professional Courses, Computer Courses Within Large Courses Were Very Easy to Learn. Attended Class Regularly, While Skipping Professional Classes and Diligently Studying Computer Courses; Spent Daily Time on Forums: “JingYi Forum,” “I Love Crack,” Combining What Little Assembly and C++ Knowledge Was Learned from the Forums to Take On-Line Orders for Profit, Receiving Increasingly Positive Feedback, And Gradually Became More Involved – Unable to Be Pulled Back. Eventually, Choosing a Niche Profession – Writing Code for Chips – The Family Didn’t Pay Much Attention, Allowing Me to Choose It Myself. At This Time, &lt;strong&gt;The Third Key Figure: My Cousin&lt;/strong&gt; – High Education, Working at Baidu. Grandma Also Understood Me, Knowing That I Hadn&amp;rsquo;t Been Focused on Research Since a Young Age, So I Talked to Him About It.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;five-graduation&#34;&gt;Five. Graduation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a key point I know – I learned how to bypass firewalls, took elective courses in Computer Information Retrieval, and quickly found and located information and problems. A valuable colleague appeared in my work, &lt;strong&gt;Mr. [硕哥&amp;rsquo;s Pinyin - Shuo Ge]&lt;/strong&gt;, who gave me time to learn independently and troubleshoot issues from the ground up, taking me to meet with the leaders of the R&amp;amp;D center.
These experiences laid the groundwork; in Shenzhen, everyone perceived me as highly capable, successfully leading the transaction channel group.
That’s where the problem lies: I lacked systematic learning in computer operating systems, algorithms, and software engineering design. All my knowledge was based on my own past experience. This led to frequent contradictions and rejections of my code designs, a lack of guidelines for module design, and ultimately, fatigue after seven years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-coronavirus-unlocking/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The policy announcement was incredibly sudden, and the execution was swift – the Health Code QR code was lifted, and checks in public places ceased. Browsing the Chinese-language version of The New York Times, the entire front page was dominated by discussions about China’s reopening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t comment on the policies; I’m simply recording what’s happening around me. Originally, Beijing had no zero-COVID policy, but the relaxation of restrictions spread rapidly, resulting in widespread infections. Among my friends, none were seriously ill. Shenzhen, bordering Guangzhou, also began to develop quickly. As I write this, with colleagues based in the suburbs of Shanghai, there haven’t been any large-scale outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back home, the protective measures were minimal, and they spread rapidly. Most people likely experienced a similar feeling – suddenly, things opened up, with policies changing weekly until a full reopening was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cannot be denied that the zero-COVID policy had its effects; we must adapt to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;While reviewing the code, &lt;code&gt;std::this_thread::yield()&lt;/code&gt; suddenly popped into my view, a syntax sugar from &lt;code&gt;C11&lt;/code&gt; that I’d used quite a bit, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t consult the manual; first, I thought it had something to do with asynchronous operations – the word was used in the coroutine implementation of the Boost library.  Clearly, it wasn’t related to coroutines; it’s about controlling logic within a regular thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;documentation&#34;&gt;Documentation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;yield&#34;&gt;yield
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accuracy of this function depends on the implementation, particularly the OS scheduler mechanism and system state used. For example, the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) real-time scheduler (Linux’s SCHED_FIFO) will suspend the current thread and place it at the end of the queue for other threads with the same priority that are ready to run (and has no effect if there are no other threads with the same priority).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sleep_for&#34;&gt;sleep_for
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocks the current thread&amp;rsquo;s execution for at least the specified &lt;code&gt;sleep_duration&lt;/code&gt;.
This function may block longer than &lt;code&gt;sleep_duration&lt;/code&gt; due to scheduling or resource contention delays.
The standard library recommends measuring durations using a monotonic clock. If implementing with system time instead, the wait time may be sensitive to clock adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both functions are designed to release the current thread and its associated resources, with the actual effect depending on the platform. I’m still a bit unclear at this point, so let&amp;rsquo;s run the code to see the execution results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis-5&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the running results, it’s not difficult to understand that due to differences in operating system implementations, the stability of high-precision sleep varies greatly. If you want high-precision sleep, using &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; is more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time precision is increased to &lt;code&gt;ms&lt;/code&gt;, the difference between them is no longer significant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linux Server, Reset MySQL Password</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-server-reset-mysql-password/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 14:27:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-server-reset-mysql-password/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an idle Tencent Cloud server that was expiring at the end of the year and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t planned to renew it. So, I decided to deploy a MySQL database for development purposes. When reinstalling the system, I wanted to save time and chose a third-party image provided by Tencent Cloud, which already had MySQL installed. I thought the system should include a Readme file or similar documentation explaining the password and deployment path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tencent Cloud server reinstalled very quickly, taking about a minute. Once logged in, &lt;code&gt;systemctl status mysql&lt;/code&gt; showed that the service was running. I started searching for the password but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it anywhere, and I began to panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I thought, since I had already accessed the server with root privileges, there must be a way to reset the password. I searched through documentation and found a forum post on Alibaba Cloud’s forum, continuing to tinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reset-password&#34;&gt;Reset Password
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit the configuration file &lt;code&gt;vim /etc/my.cnf&lt;/code&gt;, adding the following configuration to the &lt;code&gt;mysqld&lt;/code&gt; node: &lt;code&gt;skip-grant-tables&lt;/code&gt;, then execute the command to restart the database: &lt;code&gt;systemctl restart mysql&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, log in directly to the data using &lt;code&gt;mysql&lt;/code&gt;, and then proceed with normal operations. To reset the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; user password and enable allowing remote login, revert the modified configuration file, restart the database, and you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 22:10:14 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the vast system of Chinese characters, the character “命” (life/fate) is unique; there isn’t even a single homophone. Perhaps this subtly suggests that each person&amp;rsquo;s life has only one opportunity, cannot be replicated, and cannot be relived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During leisure time, I browsed the rankings on Qidian Chinese Net, and “The Nomenclature of Nights” consistently topped the charts with over two million monthly votes, a significant gap from the second-place ranking. Previously, I had primarily read works by well-known authors like Tang Jia San Shao and Ergen; this time, I decided to try a new author’s work to experience a different reading sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of early August, “The Nomenclature of Nights” had amassed two million monthly votes, while the second-place ranking stood at only eight hundred thousand – a staggering disparity that left me speechless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize my knowledge is limited and I lack the ability to critically evaluate the author’s writing style. However, after reading through over a dozen chapters, the book’s plot is tightly paced and intricately linked, captivating readers and earning such high monthly votes – it&amp;rsquo;s truly well-deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, just like the character “ming” (life/fate), the character “si” (death) also doesn’t have any homophones in Chinese characters; does this perhaps also contain a similarly unique and irreplaceable depth of meaning regarding the end of life?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A Brief Overview of Automated Testing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shallow-discussion-on-automation-testing/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 11:39:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shallow-discussion-on-automation-testing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The investment in testing for financial trading systems far exceeds that of other systems, with cumbersome test steps repeatedly executed and a low &lt;code&gt;ROI&lt;/code&gt;. As projects and personnel change, uncontrollable factors inevitably introduce more issues; a common scenario involves modifying a field output from Interface A, which then impacts the results of Interface B. With each release, risk accumulates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theoretical-knowledge&#34;&gt;Theoretical Knowledge
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Measure the Value of Automation?&lt;/strong&gt;
An automation testing ROI = (Manual Execution Time) * (Number of Runs) / (Development Cost + Maintenance Cost)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Features Should Be Automated?&lt;/strong&gt;
Frequently used features that are unlikely to change. Writing automated test code for this type of interface yields the highest returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Choose This Timing to Drive Automation Testing?&lt;/strong&gt;
Not appropriate near project launch – distant water doesn’t quench immediate thirst; automation is a long-term return model. Most suitable when the project is already in &lt;strong&gt;production environment&lt;/strong&gt; and within a stable release cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;framework-selection&#34;&gt;Framework Selection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the task of automation testing without prior practical experience, a typical starting point is to open a search engine and find tools and frameworks that can be used with the current system’s &lt;strong&gt;technology stack&lt;/strong&gt;, review the user manuals, and get started. If you can immediately find a suitable tool, congratulations, &lt;strong&gt;perfect start&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me preface this by saying I might be wrong. After reviewing relevant materials, it&amp;rsquo;s not about whether it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist; rather, the frameworks themselves are too complex and consume excessive resources. For beginners, what’s needed is something small, streamlined, and concise. Consulting with colleagues in the testing group led to the suggestion of a &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; self-built framework – essentially, wrapping existing unit testing frameworks into an automated testing framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referencing the design thinking for this project: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/wintests/pytestDemo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/wintests/pytestDemo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-use-a-framework&#34;&gt;Why Use a Framework?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Services have multiple different deployment environments – development, testing, and live testing. The purpose of a framework is to act as an abstraction layer, separating test cases and data. This allows for configuring different case data based on the specific environment configuration, and also supports shared data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core logic is focused on increasing the utilization of automation. When scenarios become more complex, the data between different environments is completely unrelated – there’s no connection whatsoever. Simply add a &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; tag when defining case data to specify the supported environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Do We Need to Learn a New Language?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/why-learn-a-new-language/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 11:27:30 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/why-learn-a-new-language/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting from my academic years, I’ve been working with &lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; for over ten years. So, why do I need to learn other programming languages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work experience: Lacking experience in elegant module design, &lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; syntax is freeform. Learning other languages helps me guide the development of more elegant designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often use them when writing some tools. The design principles for low-level libraries and business modules are also becoming clearer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visual Studio Compilation Character Set [Converted]</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-compilation-character-set-translation/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 10:51:43 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; cross-platform development. Commonly encountered on Chinese operating systems: &lt;code&gt;error C2001&lt;/code&gt;: constant contains a newline character&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio&#34;&gt;Visual Studio
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmake&lt;/code&gt; organizes project compilation scripts, generating a temporary solution under the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; system for development. The reason for cross-platform compatibility is that the file encoding is chosen as &lt;code&gt;utf-8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference materials thoroughly explained the causes of the problem from first principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding encoding, &lt;code&gt;MSVC&lt;/code&gt; has dedicated compilation options &lt;code&gt;/source-charset&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/execution-charset&lt;/code&gt;. The former indicates the encoding of the file itself, and the latter indicates what encoding the byte sequence within the compiled character array is. Encoding issues can generally be solved using these two options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt; console defaults to displaying &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt; encoding, but since the code file itself is &lt;code&gt;utf-8&lt;/code&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s not convenient to directly change it to &lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt; due to cross-platform considerations, we wouldn’t include writing conversion code for different platforms here. On &lt;code&gt;Win10&lt;/code&gt;, you can set these two compilation options to &lt;code&gt;/source-charset:utf-8 /execution-charset:gbk&lt;/code&gt;, indicating that the compiler should read in with &lt;code&gt;UTF-8&lt;/code&gt; encoding and then convert it to &lt;code&gt;GBK&lt;/code&gt; for storage within the array. This allows direct use of &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; to display Chinese characters normally in the &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt; console.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t know politics, don’t make comments, record this “carnival” on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;musings&#34;&gt;Musings
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Tangshan Assault Incident&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Primary School Textbook Cultural Invasion Incident&lt;/strong&gt; – I wonder how many people even remember them anymore. These trending news stories have become numbingly commonplace, without much feeling, and I just watch TV as usual after work, observing the spectacle. The economic situation is already dire; a war wouldn’t make things any better.  I don&amp;rsquo;t understand politics or offer commentary, simply recording this internet-fueled “carnival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wiki-overviewhttpszhwikipediaorgwiki2022e5b9b4e58d97e8a5bfc2b7e8a3b4e6b49be8a5bfe8a8aae5958fe58fb0e781a3&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E5%B9%B4%E5%8D%97%E8%A5%BF%C2%B7%E8%A3%B4%E6%B4%9B%E8%A5%BF%E8%A8%AA%E5%95%8F%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Wiki Overview&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nancy Pelosi&amp;rsquo;s visit to Taiwan in 2022, also known as the Pelosi visit to Taiwan, refers to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s 2022 trip to Asia, specifically her itinerary including a visit to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the U.S. House Speaker being considered the third-highest official in the United States and plans to visit Taiwan, the date was approaching the Chinese People&amp;rsquo;s Liberation Army&amp;rsquo;s (PLA) Founding Day on August 1st, and long-term it was approaching the Communist Party of China’s Twentieth National Congress, the 2022 U.S. elections, and the 2022 Republic of China local elections. The People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China side strongly protested, dispatching destroyer task forces to the northeast waters of the Taiwan Strait and mobilizing the Shandong and Liaoning aircraft carrier strike groups. The Eastern Theater Command and the Southern Theater Command respectively conducted large-scale live ammunition exercises in the East Sea and South China Sea. On the U.S. side, the Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier strike group arrived near the Taiwan Strait to guard against Pelosi’s possible visit to Taiwan, and dispatched several batches of reconnaissance aircraft and aerial refueling tankers to standby at the US Kadena Air Force Base. Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden had a video meeting prior to the visit, which covered the issue of Taiwan. Taiwanese and international media revealed that Speaker Pelosi and the House of Representatives delegation would arrive at Songshan Airport in Taipei on the 2nd, stay overnight, and meet with Taiwan’s Presidential Office leader Tsai Ing-wen and other senior government officials on the 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;08-11&#34;&gt;08-11
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By today, this has pretty much settled down. During this time, the headlines were dominated by various naval exercises, and Zhihu was putting in a lot of effort to update its trending charts every day, talking about all of this. Let the reporters work hard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Quickly calculate folder size on the Windows platform</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-platform-quick-folder-size-statistics/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 19:54:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-platform-quick-folder-size-statistics/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Linux platform is very simple: &lt;code&gt;du -sh *&lt;/code&gt; – just one line of code solves the problem. What about Windows? With many disks and a desire to clean up, with numerous files, the system’s built-in Resource Manager is too slow to calculate folder sizes, making you want to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;everything&#34;&gt;Everything
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers working on the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; platform, you probably haven&amp;rsquo;t personally used &lt;code&gt;everything&lt;/code&gt;, and should at least have heard of it. Its search speed far exceeds that of the built-in file explorer. Given that system-level support for fast indexing exists, we can certainly find similar tools that build file indexes while also tracking file sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wiztree&#34;&gt;WizTree
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Website: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.diskanalyzer.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

Use the standard installation method or the green version to unzip and run.
It’s fast, with a wide variety of data display types – the left side features a tree diagram mode, the right side displays file types, and there&amp;rsquo;s also graphical visualization available at the bottom of the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spacesniffer-update-2023-no-longer-maintained&#34;&gt;SpaceSniffer (Update 2023 No Longer Maintained)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software Website: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation is very simple – select the corresponding drive letter, and the software will display folder sizes in a graphical way, with larger volumes resulting in larger matrices in the images.  Other operations are easily understood by simply clicking on them. It supports inputting filter conditions for files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

        <title>How to Copy Webpage Stylesheets (CSS): Element Inspector</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-copy-webpage-css-element-inspection/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 23:36:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-copy-webpage-css-element-inspection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Static blog themes, the mainstream is based on foreign templates, modified and adjusted without much consideration for Chinese content layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half a month ago, I adjusted the blog’s stylesheet – as I’ve been developing backend services for many years, I’m a pure newbie in frontend. After struggling with it for half a day, the design wasn&amp;rsquo;t very reasonable. Suddenly an idea struck me: I looked at the technical blogs I often read – infoq and OpenChina – and their layouts look really good. Could I borrow some of those? After reviewing the source files, I got lost trying to locate the relevant elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontend developers might be laughing at this point… I didn’t understand how to locate the specified elements, but that&amp;rsquo;s okay; I have plenty of free time on weekends, so I stopped to think about it. It reminded me of when I wrote Python crawlers – I had used something similar then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;element-inspection&#34;&gt;Element Inspection
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s right, it’s the built-in element inspection tool in the browser – copying style sheets, locating specific elements, all done in minutes. &lt;code&gt;selector&lt;/code&gt; to locate elements, &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; to create a ‘user define css’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy outerHTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy selector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy JS path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy styles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy XPath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy full XPath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Editing Extremely Large Files on the Windows Platform: EmEditor (Text Editor)</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-platform-editing-large-files-emeditor-text-editor/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai GuoAn database incident, which caused a huge stir within the black hacking circles, remains unclear whether it’s true or false. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what we remember in two years and look back on it then. Based on past experience, I updated a batch of local social engineering databases, and I came across a massive SQL file: 17.9G. A standard text editor couldn’t even preview it, let alone open it. Chatting with netizens, someone mentioned EmEditor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Website: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.emeditor.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.emeditor.com/&lt;/a&gt;
I took a look at it over the weekend and found it quite convenient. The design supports editing large files, and when sufficient memory is available, the entire file is loaded into memory, resulting in fast search and editing speeds. It also supports splitting files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Shanghai Fen Yong Guo (Shun Duck Soup Pot) Lockdown</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-closure/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 23:03:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-closure/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The leadership team insisted for two days that Shanghai wouldn’t be locked down, that Shanghai was important. But in the end, facing the reality or to preserve their own prestige, they came up with a strategy of sealing off the area across the Huangpu River first, followed by sealing off the riverbank on this side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lockdown&#34;&gt;Lockdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I experienced the SARS epidemic, and I don’t have many memories of it. Later, when I saw related materials, it ended because its incubation period was short and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a nationwide spread yet. I remember being in primary school back then, and we would finish school very early every day. There was always the smell of disinfectant hanging in the air in the classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the end of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has been going on for almost three years. People working abroad have become accustomed to it, wearing masks when they need to. The Shanghai outbreak has repeatedly fluctuated, originating from Hong Kong and then spreading across the border to Shenzhen, and here in Shanghai, it was due to a wave of imported cases from Hong Kong. The official announcement stated that the spread of the epidemic was caused by inadequate protection measures at the quarantine hotels. Although the mutated virus had reduced its toxicity, its transmission speed had increased, facilitated by the spread through hotel ventilation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lockdown-1&#34;&gt;Lockdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can all see from the results, the new cases have already exceeded 20,000, leaving us with no choice but to implement a lockdown. Notably, it didn’t use the word “lockdown” externally, as it had previously stated in a press conference that Shanghai did not need a lockdown, which was intended to preserve its last shred of face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grocery-shopping&#34;&gt;Grocery Shopping
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delivery industry is a new emerging sector driven by the internet. The core of it relies on someone delivering groceries for you, right? However, due to widespread lockdowns in many areas during the pandemic, merchants could operate but no one was available to deliver, which removed the final link in the chain. People outside of this situation may not fully understand – how could a cosmopolitan metropolis like Shanghai, with its large population, have everyone flocking to buy groceries together? In reality, it’s easy to see that most people are also migrant workers who come from other places to work and live in rented apartments, typically eating at company canteens or restaurants, rarely cooking at home. When this route becomes blocked, those with the means will start buying groceries. Because this lockdown announcement was not made in advance, people didn’t have much food or vegetables stored up as a daily reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;industry&#34;&gt;Industry
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of us are working in the IT industry. I experienced the impact of the pandemic, getting a taste of remote work. Back in 2019, I stayed at home for almost a month, changing my train tickets back and forth ten times, with no certainty about when I would be able to return to Shenzhen.  I can’t even imagine how those people in the catering, tourism, or many service industries have been getting by these past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When you want to make money</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/when-you-want-to-make-money/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 03:23:53 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/when-you-want-to-make-money/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ordinary people are social animals, that’s right – you are an individual, but also a bipedal animal, with strong social attributes; you have feelings of inferiority and vanity, and society is constantly changing and eroding your &lt;strong&gt;everydayness&lt;/strong&gt;. We don&amp;rsquo;t discuss those great figures, those who willingly burn themselves for society or the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-current-situation&#34;&gt;My Current Situation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at average wages or my hometown’s salaries, my current income is significantly above the average – what more could I possibly want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you earn one million, you start thinking about earning one hundred million; once you earn one hundred million, you start thinking about earning a billion. This is natural for ordinary people; we must face our inner selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-current-situation-1&#34;&gt;My Current Situation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s red are the more relaxed ways to make money: short videos. Everyone knows it&amp;rsquo;s not simple to enter an industry. What you see is short video content, but what you don’t see is the behind-the-scenes work of filming and copywriting. But everyone has their own dream – I’m suited for that industry, I was born to be in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting Started
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve watched so many videos. If you analyze a lot of the shots with your own brain, you can clearly see professional editing techniques and strong cinematic elements. Basically, some of them are from people who have formal training – film school graduates, for example. Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s also the logic of grassroots success, but that doesn’t apply to most people, does it?
On TikTok, you’ll also find many videos teaching you how to make videos. At this point, people are starting to wake up. If they could really make money, why would they teach others how to do it instead of doing it themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anti-human-recommendation-algorithms&#34;&gt;Anti-Human Recommendation Algorithms
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the Douyin algorithm would recommend movie clips and anime clips while I was scrolling. It felt surprisingly engaging, to the point where you’d start to find it interesting yourself. However, when I looked into how Douyin makes money, it started recommending various tutorial videos non-stop, flooding my entire recommendation stream. As someone who also works in the IT industry, this made me feel like the algorithm “big brothers” were having a bit of a problem – you’re essentially suggesting this to me, are you thinking I&amp;rsquo;m stupid or are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; stupid? The key thing is that it keeps finding new ways to recommend videos on how to make money with Douyin, from different angles and across various types. It’s like they’re constantly adapting. This draft was written at 3 AM, and frankly, I didn’t want to write it in the first place. I started wondering how long this business model could last – how much time can you siphon away from people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-clarity&#34;&gt;Finding Clarity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When teaching people how to do things, presenting a set of rules for them and then being unable to control yourself when doing it is ridiculous. As I’m not a purely technical blog writer, I haven&amp;rsquo;t published some things domestically, so here I casually rant. If one day I get banned, that can only be said to move somewhere else. I can’t say I haven’t done anything with Douyin – at least now it actively cooperates in the dissemination of real-time news and the propaganda of national policies, because in our country, you can&amp;rsquo;t defy the Communist Party, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now think back to when you were studying. When you truly can’t find the meaning of life, quietly reading a book is enough. In this era, how many people can still quiet themselves down and quietly read books?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also want to thank the progress of science and technology. If you’re seeing this line, you’ll realize that the entire manuscript is very colloquial. And I really just kept writing and writing it. The input method I usually used was Sogou Input Method, which I&amp;rsquo;d been using for about seven or eight years. However, when it came to voice input, it had to be said that Xunfei was more professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the article number was changed to 002. Why did it have two zeros? There’s a dream – this year I wanted to break the hundred articles, which is just a dream, right? It&amp;rsquo;s not really articles; it’s more like records. I reflect on myself every day, and you must be able to think of some things, right?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adding a code copy button – seemingly simple things</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/add-code-copy-button/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 01:23:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/add-code-copy-button/</guid>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent four hours trying to figure this out, and when I saw the sentence, it was hilarious. How could it have taken so long? When I finally looked at the time, it was only three hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first draft of the year 2022, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t complicated – exactly as the title said. (At that time, I was still very young), I thought simply copying &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ouuan.github.io/post/from-hexo-to-hugo/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;作业&lt;/a&gt; would be enough, putting it in my favorites folder, and dragging it out for over a month before finally remembering the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When migrating to &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;, I always felt that the plugins were too few, couldn&amp;rsquo;t copy code, which made copying notes from Evernote to the blog very cumbersome, seriously hindering my motivation for writing a casual blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword&#34;&gt;Foreword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, carefully read the original author’s draft, read it through completely and flip through the author&amp;rsquo;s introduction. Wow, I encountered a big shot – Tsinghua University undergraduate, has been exposed to computers early on. Let’s see, just a facade, let’s take a look at this blog first, completely forgot what he was supposed to do. Also browse the author’s &lt;code&gt;Github&lt;/code&gt; repository, this modified ‘even’ theme is much more beautiful than now and has many new features, let&amp;rsquo;s get started, first merge the related code into the current one.

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;129&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;311px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-features-view-article-history-associate-submission-records&#34;&gt;New Features: View Article History, Associate Submission Records
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect is still good, and you can experience it by dragging it to the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before taking action, I didn’t carefully examine the author&amp;rsquo;s original repository history, assuming a simple merge would fix everything. In the end, I merged a huge amount of code with numerous conflicts and N times of mindless overwriting – all of which were frontend and rendering template codes. I took the version I needed as the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repository address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TianlongXiang/hugo-theme-even&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/TianlongXiang/hugo-theme-even&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chinese pitfall: if &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t adjust this parameter, the generated one won&amp;rsquo;t get the current article’s &lt;code&gt;commit hash&lt;/code&gt;, causing the history link generation to fail. When generating the complete historical record of the article, you also need to modify the automatic integration script and remember to pull the entire historical record of the current repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[feat: Attempt to pull the full GitHub repository to dynamically update the last modification record of the article](&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-features-view-article-history-associate-submission-records-1&#34;&gt;New Features: View Article History, Associate Submission Records
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TianlongXiang/TianlongXiang.github.io/commit/1b5d719966737f16a8c67880370dc2722adea0b3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;chore: Path contains Chinese, Hugo GitInfo needs to enable this setting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;style-adjustments&#34;&gt;Style Adjustments
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust website content width, the previous design was suitable for both mobile and desktop devices; in reality, no one actually viewed it on their phones, and I personally view it on my computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The directory bar supports automatic expansion/collapse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;body&#34;&gt;Body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referenced the &lt;code&gt;ouuan&lt;/code&gt; code records for half an hour and still couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite understand how to increase the copy button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time travel, a month later, it came back to this matter again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;body-1&#34;&gt;Body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I didn’t understand this assignment, I switched to copying from another one – it&amp;rsquo;s always easier to understand when you copy. The results of my searches were surprisingly helpful; a post on the official &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; forum mentioned how to add a copy button. Going there to check, the logic was clear. It was baffling until I returned to the site and saw that the styling generated by &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; differed from the description in the documentation – this part was quite complicated. I’m just going to record it simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand front-end development, when I don&amp;rsquo;t know something, I open my browser’s “Inspect” tool and analyze the code, relying on the style information on the right side to slowly figure out the logic; I didn’t understand &lt;code&gt;JavaScript&lt;/code&gt;, so I added some logs to the console. There were many things I didn’t understand at first. Taking a deep breath and carefully sorting through and breaking down the logic, you can always find a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;pre&lt;/code&gt; node has multiple instances; here it refers to a single code block, which the theme rendered with line numbers, resulting in two copies when the copy button is used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to disable the theme&amp;rsquo;s built-in code highlighting, but I’m unfamiliar with these theme settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I consulted the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; website for resources and read a bit, learning that there’s a &lt;code&gt;markup&lt;/code&gt; setting to control code highlighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjusting the configuration file didn’t work; the rendering was different from what I expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I discovered this set of settings &lt;code&gt;pygmentsOptions&lt;/code&gt; and continued to consult documentation, adjusting the settings, starting by removing line numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I configured a custom &lt;code&gt;css&lt;/code&gt; stylesheet and a custom &lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt; script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;body-2&#34;&gt;Body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since I’ve been doing so much, my brain suddenly thought of a color palette I saw recently that looked good, and changed the button styles: Let&amp;rsquo;s go with Chinese-style sky blue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;special-img-class&#34; style=&#34;width:20%&#34; src=&#34;2022-02-25-02-01-22.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;special-img-class&#34; style=&#34;width:20%&#34; src=&#34;2022-02-25-02-01-33.png&#34; /&gt;
ouuan spent four hours on this, and when I saw that sentence, I even thought it was funny. How could it take so long? When I looked at the time, it was only three hours.

&lt;p&gt;Wang Yi-zi said: Human relationships, spanning a lifetime of mutual support and dependence, may be held within one’s embrace, understood in the confines of one room; or they may arise from entrusted messages, dissolving into the vastness beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a lifetime, like a fleeting flower. Like grass and trees blossoming and withering, like the rising and setting of the sun and moon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet, in this life, desires are numerous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a child, I lay under lotus plants and hemp in the stream, busy catching the east wind to fly kites, chasing yellow butterflies in haste,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also learned to grow gourds by the shade of mulberry trees, returning home with a full meal after dusk, not shedding my cloak to lie beneath the moonlight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I grew older, I hoped to be inscribed on the gold list, to have a beautiful woman accompany me, to have endless wealth, to rise continuously, to have a full table of guests, to have nightly singing and dancing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When old, I wanted health and longevity, welcome childhood servants, young children waiting at the door, a chessboard, a confidant, a bottle of wine, a courtyard, enjoying family harmony.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see people rushing about in a hurry, only seeking a few taels of broken silver. Yet, this broken silver, can it dispel all kinds of melancholy in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Half the people are still struggling to make ends meet, where do they have time to pursue meaning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, human life is just an experience, like plants, the sun and moon – experiencing the cycle of desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t understand it, you’ll feel like a gnat in the vast universe, a grain of sand on the Yangtze River. When you do understand, you can be happy with what you encounter, enjoy what you have temporarily, find contentment in yourself, and live joyfully until old age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can pursue wealth and fame, or poetry, wine, flowers, and tea. You can pursue the clear breeze on the river or the bright moon in the mountains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But don’t overly concern yourself with the results; they will all eventually pass away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a lifetime of hardship, when you arrive in this world, try to experience the joys and sorrows, birth, old age, sickness, and death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really like this quote from The Tale of the Sea Stallion – A Princess’s Love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I greatly enjoyed &lt;em&gt;The Analects of Zan Gong&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the rise of past generations, one feels a sense of longing; if only one could truly connect with them, never lamenting their fate, unable to explain it within one’s heart. One knows that dying as one’s life is illusory, and the tragedy of Zang and Peng is merely fabricated. When posterity looks upon us now, we are like we are now looking upon them. Alas!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, at some stage in life, people find themselves lost in a haze, unsure of what they truly want. Amidst the mundane routines of work, they gradually lose their pursuit of meaning and purpose. Looking back to when I first graduated, my heart was full of fervent aspirations – I wouldn’t hesitate to say that I longed to write code, to create brilliant, eye-catching code. However, as I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for so long, I’ve had more exposure to business-level affairs, which has largely benefited from the advantages brought about by industry development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of my life philosophy, I haven’t yet incorporated marriage and having children, or establishing a family, into my thinking. My mind is almost empty, simply focused on enjoying the present moment. Whenever weekends arrive, I enjoy quietly playing games, often spending an entire day at home, immersed in my own little world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buying-a-house&#34;&gt;Buying a House
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I was full of enthusiasm, planning to save diligently and buy my own property. I meticulously budgeted every day towards this goal. However, as housing prices continued to skyrocket, my anxiety and resentment gradually turned into numbness, leading me to feel that even if I bought a house, it would simply be a heavy burden on my shoulders. Consequently, I abandoned this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;saving-money&#34;&gt;Saving Money
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, saving money was about achieving some small goals, such as building a high-performance desktop computer, purchasing a long-desired camera, or taking an impromptu trip. However, now I approach saving with a more relaxed and “chill” attitude, no longer worrying too much about daily expenses – I indulge in things I want to eat and boldly try new and exciting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;returning-home&#34;&gt;Returning Home
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I realized that what I most longed for deep down was simply to go home. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything particularly to do, just to return to that familiar place and feel the warmth and tranquility of home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Hong Kong Futures Basic Concepts</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-futures-basics/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 10:54:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-futures-basics/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As financial markets continue to evolve, investors have begun seeking more effective investment tools to enhance their investment returns. To meet investor demand, The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has launched a range of stock futures contracts, all of which represent stocks listed on its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), which boasts high trading volumes and active liquidity. Through investing in stock futures, investors can participate in the performance of individual companies while also benefiting from the short selling and leverage effects offered by the derivatives market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the underlying stocks represented by stock futures are typically leading companies within their respective industries, investors can strategically select to invest in those industry-specific futures if they believe a particular sector’s performance will outperform or underperform the overall stock market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-definition&#34;&gt;Basic Definition
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stock futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specified quantity of financial value (the contract size) equivalent to a specified number of shares (the underlying stock) at a predetermined price (the agreed-upon price) on a future, specified date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All stock futures contracts are settled in cash and do not involve the physical delivery of shares upon expiration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contract-expiry&#34;&gt;Contract Expiry
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon contract expiry, the profit or loss amount is calculated as the difference between the agreed-upon price and the final settlement price multiplied by the contract multiplier, which will be deducted from the clearing member’s margin account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final settlement price refers to the official closing price of the stock reported by the Shanghai Stock Exchange on the last trading day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a futures investor wishes to close out their position before expiry, a short seller only needs to buy back one futures contract, while a long position holder must sell one futures contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;margin-deposit&#34;&gt;Margin Deposit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In futures trading, both buyers and sellers are required to initially deposit a basic margin as collateral to fulfill the contract. After each daily settlement, the clearing organization calculates profits or losses for all open contracts based on the closing market price and uses this to deduct from the investor’s margin account. If unfavorable market conditions result in an investor incurring losses that cause their margin to fall below the specified level, the exchange will require the investor to top up their margin within a designated timeframe to maintain it at the original basic margin level (i.e., to cover).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advantages&#34;&gt;Advantages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Transaction Fees: Each stock futures contract is equivalent to thousands of shares, but brokerage commissions are determined by the number of contracts, making transaction costs relatively low in relation to contract value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier Short Selling: Because investors can easily short stocks through futures contracts, they can profit during market declines by shorting stock futures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market Maker System: To ensure market liquidity, The Hong Kong Exchange &amp;amp; Clearing Limited (HKEX) requires market makers to simultaneously provide buy and sell prices within a specified range, maintaining circulation in the stock futures market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage Effect: Investors only need to pay a margin representing a small portion of the contract value when buying or selling stock futures contracts, making hedging and trading more cost-effective. - Reduce foreign investor’s currency risk: Stock futures contracts provide a way for overseas investors to invest in high-quality local stocks because buying and selling stock futures only requires paying a margin, rather than the full contract value, thereby significantly reducing the currency risk borne by overseas investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading through electronic trading systems: Stock futures contracts are traded using the Taiwan Futures Exchange’s electronic trading system. All orders are executed in the order of price and time, and immediate display of buy prices, sell prices, and transaction prices ensures maximum market transparency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advantages-1&#34;&gt;Advantages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearing companies provide performance guarantees: Stock futures contracts will be registered, settled, and guaranteed by HKFE Clearing Ltd (the clearing company), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange.  Due to the clearing company being the counterparty for all open positions, there is no need for participants in the exchange to bear counterparty risk between themselves. However, the scope of this guarantee does not include the financial responsibility of the exchange participants towards their clients; investors should exercise caution and diligence when selecting a broker for buying and selling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;market-making&#34;&gt;Market Making
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market participants or individual stock futures contracts may register as market makers on the exchange and simultaneously provide both buy and sell prices within the specified maximum spread. Exchange participants and their clients should note that individual stock futures contracts may not have a market maker registered to provide buy-sell spreads, and their trades will be based on market trading units. &lt;strong&gt;Investors should be aware that buying and selling stock futures without a registered market maker may involve liquidity risk, and caution should be exercised before entering the market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;risks-of-trading-stock-futures&#34;&gt;Risks of Trading Stock Futures
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock futures involve high risks. Losses arising from trading stock futures may exceed the initial margin paid at opening, potentially requiring you to pay additional margins within a short period. If unable to meet these payments, your position may be liquidated, and you will bear all resulting losses. Therefore, it is essential to fully understand the risks associated with trading stock futures and assess whether it’s suitable for you. Before engaging in transactions, consult with a broker or financial advisor to determine if futures and options contracts are appropriate based on your financial situation and investment objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adjusting-comments&#34;&gt;Adjusting Comments
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a listed company changes its capital structure through methods such as cash offers or stock dividends, the stock price will change at the time of net asset valuation or the effective date, and correspondingly, uncovered contracts may also be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If other circumstances remain unchanged, the value held by shareholders’ portfolios will not change on the settlement day, but this is different for buyers or holders of stock futures. Unless the futures contract is appropriately adjusted. If the initial pricing remains unchanged and the contract multiplier remains constant, the adjustment of the stock price will unfairly and unjustly affect the value of the stock futures holding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the clearinghouse determines the adjustment ratio, it does so based on maintaining the fair value of the futures contracts and only makes adjustments when there are significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Capital Monopoly and the Demise of the Online Education Industry</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:59:08 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent two trading days have seen a significant stock market decline, exposing newcomers to the risks of the market. China is about to enter an aging demographic phase, and birth rates are dismal, with the reduction exceeding the estimates of relevant experts, hindering industries that obstruct declining birth rates; the Party will take decisive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;student-burden-reduction&#34;&gt;Student Burden Reduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of us born in the 1990s didn’t have as many extracurricular classes, tutoring programs, or the freedom to run wild after school. This was primarily due to our families&amp;rsquo; limited resources, and secondarily because tutoring companies hadn’t yet established a strong brand reputation, making it difficult for parents to trust them. Twenty years have passed since then, and starting in 2019, the K12 education capitalization trend emerged, with companies like猿辅导 (Yuancuizou – literally “Monkey Tutoring”) appearing as online tutoring platforms based on code. With the backing of capital, these companies created various high-end tutoring programs by concentrating excellent resources. Despite exorbitant fees, parents’ enthusiasm remained undeterred. &amp;gt; During the urbanization process, many parents have relied on education as a path to escape from humble backgrounds and achieve a social class leap. As wage laborers themselves, they lack sufficient time to care for their children, adding to their own intense competition and reluctance to see their children fall behind peers. Given the difficulty of rising above one&amp;rsquo;s origins (“noble offspring”) in traditional Chinese society, and the limited options for maintaining or advancing one’s social class without a suitable education, ordinary families find it difficult to sustain their current status or make another upward leap. Enrolling children in vocational schools is seen as an unacceptable slide down the social ladder – a perspective largely held by parents within the current societal environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-student-burden&#34;&gt;Reducing Student Burden
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit the reasons behind extracurricular tutoring and why parents seek it out. Textbook knowledge and example questions are straightforward – many students can understand them easily. However, most subjects cover broad concepts superficially without delving deeply into them. The talent selection mechanism requires differentiation, which leads to a contradiction: exam questions based solely on textbook knowledge cannot effectively filter candidates. This necessitates horizontal and vertical expansion of knowledge. These areas are aspects that teachers simply cannot cover in the classroom, creating the fertile ground for extracurricular tutoring to flourish. The document contains a large amount of content, with thirty detailed regulations covering multiple aspects. The document outline summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comprehensively reduce the workload and duration for students, alleviating excessive academic burdens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance the level of after-school services offered by schools to meet diverse student needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain strict governance, comprehensively regulate external training activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significantly improve educational teaching quality to ensure students master and excel in their studies within the school environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen supporting governance and enhance support capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully organize and implement the measures to achieve tangible results. ## Reducing Student Burden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;elite-education&#34;&gt;Elite Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a phenomenon in the education sector – the increasing prevalence of powerful private schools. Public schools are struggling to provide sufficient high-quality resources (leading to enclaves/gated communities). Various sized educational groups are attracting excellent teachers with high salaries, establishing quality learning environments, and gradually building their own brands, most notably: &lt;strong&gt;Hen Shuai Model&lt;/strong&gt;. Old Home Company averages over 3000 RMB, powerful private primary schools charge between 9000 and 10000 RMB per year. Educational groups form a virtuous cycle – my tuition is expensive, but the teachers are excellent, students achieve good grades, I raise my tuition fees, and parents will still send their children there. Public school resources (teachers) are gradually being drawn to private schools, ultimately becoming synonymous with substandard education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;algorithmic-optimization&#34;&gt;Algorithmic Optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is data indicating that Meituan’s contracted delivery riders have approached 4 million, with approximately 400,000 active riders. Many people rely on this work to support their families and livelihoods. The relentless algorithmic pressure to minimize delivery times reduces individuals into measurable units, feeding them into algorithms for constant calculation and exploration of the delivery rider&amp;rsquo;s breaking point. Believing themselves clever, &lt;strong&gt;they violate human nature and serve capital&lt;/strong&gt;. The market operates here, allowing everyone to play and enjoy sustainable play, rather than &lt;strong&gt;monopolizing, wielding privileges, capitalist gameplay, and the unrestrained, barbaric growth that will inevitably come to an end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility&#34;&gt;Stock Market Volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 2021, education stocks represented by New Oriental performed a dramatic plunge, followed by Good Future in the pre-market session of the U.S. stock market, with &lt;strong&gt;stock prices halved&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has gradually entered an aging society, and various social phenomena affecting family planning must be rectified; internet companies engaged in monopoly and overtime were fined, and the capital-concentrated education industry was also being scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility-1&#34;&gt;Stock Market Volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The education industry is not allowed to be capitalized on; a single vote directly rejected relevant industries from going public for financing, and there was wailing everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A pattern of disruption to test system stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The domestic internet industry is always fond of playing with new things, often introducing terms that most people wouldn’t be able to guess what they are.
After reading some articles, this definition specifically for the early stages of Chaos Engineering is relatively easy to accept:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early exploration of Chaos Engineering has actually been ongoing within the industry, previously existing under the guise of fault testing and disaster recovery exercises. As microservice architectures continue to develop and distributed systems grow increasingly vast, Chaos Engineering has begun to emerge and gain increasing importance. Following Netflix’s formal proposal of the Chaos Engineering concept, related theories have also rapidly enriched. Netflix&amp;rsquo;s practices have also demonstrated the significant impact Chaos Engineering has on stability.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Deployment controller implements a crucial function within a Kubernetes cluster: the ability to horizontally scale and shrink Pods. This capability was essential for traditional cloud-era platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encountering a business scenario where you need to modify data in a database, restarting Pod nodes after adjustments. However, during Pod operation, table fields are continuously being updated, requiring temporary pausing of application updates to the tables, restoring the Pod after adjusting the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides brute force deletion of the Deployment, are there other ways to achieve a similar pause effect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before seeing the answer, many people might not have realized it, and upon seeing the answer, they would smile knowingly, their brains hadn&amp;rsquo;t twisted, and their thinking remained stuck in the era of directly operating processes, thinking about directly manipulating business processes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fixed Income Funds / Bond Funds</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/fund-and-fixed-income-wealth-management/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 11:27:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/fund-and-fixed-income-wealth-management/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Those of us born in the 90s, we didn’t really feel the impact of the 2008 financial crisis – after all, we were young and hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet started to focus on finance. The roaring bull market of 2015 came with a lot of fanfare, and when it ended, it made quite a stir, ultimately requiring government intervention to stabilize the markets. Simultaneously, this brought the concept of “funds” into the view of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ant-financial-and-alipay&#34;&gt;Ant Financial and Alipay
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alipay, as a natural traffic entry under Ant Financial, was born with the positioning of a payment tool. When purchasing funds, most people chose Alipay like WeChat did. Alipay successfully transformed fund sales into an ordinary shopping experience. Starting in 2019, with the small bull market, fund managers’ “warming up” recruitment, ultimately stemmed from the monetary loosening guided by the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who entered made money, those who didn&amp;rsquo;t enter were envious and rushed to join in. The scale of new funds broke through the hundred billion mark at an increasingly rapid pace, and a trillion-fund market was not far off, even in scenarios where “grandmothers” (older investors) started buying funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Ant Financial’s explosive rise as a code-based internet fund sales platform, ordinary people&amp;rsquo;s contact with fund sales was primarily through depositing money at banks, where the bank manager would enthusiastically introduce various investment products. The packaging of the internet, promotional pages guiding information, and exorbitant advertising fees paid by fund sales institutions completely detached Alipay’s fund advertisements from reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal bank fixed-term investment returns are 4%, P2P investments that were played wildly in recent years reached 8%, credit card repayment interest rates are 12%. Our protagonist, Alipay&amp;rsquo;s promoted funds of 150% and 250% are trending, making insiders happy. The market declines? Alipay is playing with fire.&lt;/strong&gt; The advertised growth figures only show the three-year returns, while traditional fund companies only provide annualized average returns. Why don’t they dare to present the annual average returns separately? It&amp;rsquo;s not because it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to calculate – the answer is no, because unfavorable data doesn’t encourage customers to buy funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fixed-income-investments&#34;&gt;Fixed Income Investments
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;China hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet entered a negative interest rate era, making bank deposits and government bonds the most secure fixed-income products. Pure credit funds are also a good option. You can refer to the data published by local statistical bureaus to find China’s average wage levels. Here’s a simple scenario: with an asset size of 2 million (CNY), a yearly yield of 4% converted, the annual income would exceed most cities&amp;rsquo; average wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is largely based on my personal experiences, and there’s much more to say. If you want to learn more, I recommend reading a variety of economic books yourself – don&amp;rsquo;t blindly follow. For ordinary families, the core of financial planning is preservation, not chasing risky dreams of getting rich quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle often says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right thing at the right time has the greatest value; study diligently when you’re studying, and earning a good degree is better than making pocket money by distributing flyers; work seriously when you first graduate, and your salary increases can bring you substantial returns; and when you start a family, learn to take care of your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue-1&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those interested can take a look at this speech transcript: “On Time,” you’ll need to read many books to find the answers – the text of the speech is available on our site.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having worked with CentOS for many years, content may not apply to macOS or Ubuntu users in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can refer to the documentation from Tsinghua University for installation guidance: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/docker-ce/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to unknown mysterious forces, domestic Docker installation is recommended to set the cloud vendor&amp;rsquo;s repository address. Here we recommend using &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Docker is a commonly used background service, recommended to be set as startup on boot. The current command applies to CentOS 7.&lt;/p&gt;

If you need to deploy &lt;code&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; subsequently, please refer to the &lt;code&gt;kubernetes&lt;/code&gt; deployment instructions and install a specific version of &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s still an unknown mysterious force causing slow image pulls. At this time, domestic cloud vendors have emerged and provided many acceleration services, which are still recommended – &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can manage your own registered Alibaba Cloud account to obtain this service, which is free. Alibaba Cloud also offers a free image build service.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linux Setup JMeter Test Environment</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-setup-jmeter-testing-environment/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 10:12:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/linux-setup-jmeter-testing-environment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The author has a strong interest in hardware and used JMeter to conduct load testing, documenting the process of deploying JMeter, InfluxDB, and Grafana on CentOS 7. They shared installation and command usage for JMeter, InfluxDB’s features and Docker installation method, as well as simple deployment and configuration for Grafana. They summarized experience and references related to high-performance programming patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As widely known, I have a strong interest in hardware. While the test team was using &lt;code&gt;JMeter&lt;/code&gt; to perform load tests and discovered that performance wasn&amp;rsquo;t improving, as a curious individual, I decisively took action to investigate how the company conducted its testing. There’s also a little story: at some point in the distant past, I had read a post on OpenChina detailing how to create more impressive-looking performance test graphs – having visualized &lt;code&gt;TPS&lt;/code&gt; data during tests for the &lt;code&gt;Windows&lt;/code&gt; version. Furthermore, what&amp;rsquo;s the use of setting up a web panel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking is one thing; actually trying it out reveals the truth.
Don’t use GUI mode for load testing! Only for Test creation and Test debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-1&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officially, it’s recommended to obtain test reports via the command line and display them with a GUI, which introduces data errors.  I don&amp;rsquo;t have deep knowledge of JMeter – at least I found a reason to tinker with a &lt;code&gt;Linux&lt;/code&gt; version console panel. The openchinese post’s core component deployment isn’t friendly; you need to follow their WeChat channel to download the required files, and as a millennial, of course I used &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt; instead. Basically, my server is located domestically, and accessing the overseas source addresses is very slow – at least using an image service like Alibaba Cloud has a free acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the installation and deployment of &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;, this will not be detailed here; please refer to previous articles for recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following content focuses on two main areas: setting up the basic test environment components and a simple explanation of each component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jmeter&#34;&gt;JMeter
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apache JMeter is a Java-based load testing tool developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It’s used to perform load testing on software, initially designed for web application testing but later expanded to other testing domains. It can be used to test static and dynamic resources such as static files, Java microservices, CGI scripts, Java objects, databases, FTP servers, etc. JMeter can simulate massive loads from various stress categories onto servers, networks, or objects to assess their strength and analyze overall performance. Furthermore, JMeter can perform functional/regression testing on applications by creating scripts with assertions to validate that your program returns the expected results. To maximize flexibility, JMeter allows the use of regular expressions to create assertions. Apache JMeter can be used to perform performance testing of static and dynamic resources (files, Servlets, Perl scripts, Java objects, databases and queries, FTP servers, etc.). It can be used to simulate heavy loads on servers, networks, or objects to test their strength or analyze overall performance under different stress types. You can use it for graphical analysis of performance metrics or for large concurrent load testing of your server/script/object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-deployment-on-centos7&#34;&gt;JMeter Deployment on CentOS7
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;code&gt;JDK&lt;/code&gt; runtime environment, download the &lt;code&gt;JMeter&lt;/code&gt; installation package, and configure environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-commands&#34;&gt;JMeter Commands
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it will be connected to the &lt;code&gt;Grafana&lt;/code&gt; dashboard, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to input the &lt;code&gt;-l&lt;/code&gt; parameter; you can observe data in the &lt;code&gt;web&lt;/code&gt; console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;influxdb&#34;&gt;InfluxDB
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfluxDB is an open-source distributed time series database written in Go. It requires no external dependencies. The database is now primarily used for storing large volumes of timestamped data, such as DevOps monitoring data, app metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influxdb-features&#34;&gt;InfluxDB Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfluxDB’s features can be summarized into the following 9 aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schema-less (Schemaless):&lt;/strong&gt; Can accommodate an arbitrary number of columns;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metric Retention Time Setting:&lt;/strong&gt;  Allows setting retention times for metrics;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Time-Related Functions:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports functions related to time (such as min, max, sum, count, mean, median, etc.) for convenient statistical analysis;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage Policy Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Can be used for data deletion and modification (InfluxDB does not provide direct methods for deleting or modifying data);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Query Support:&lt;/strong&gt;  Automatically scheduled sets of queries that run continuously, combined with storage policies to reduce InfluxDB’s system footprint;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native HTTP Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Built-in HTTP API;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for SQL-like Syntax:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports a syntax similar to SQL;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Setting Data Replication Count in Clusters:&lt;/strong&gt; Allows setting the number of replicas for data within clusters;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Periodic Sampling of Data:&lt;/strong&gt;  Writes data to another measurement, facilitating granular data storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influxdb-docker-installation&#34;&gt;InfluxDB Docker Installation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker exec -it influxdb /bin/bash&lt;/code&gt; to enter the container and execute commands, manually creating a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influxdb-database-and-user-creation&#34;&gt;InfluxDB Database and User Creation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create database: &lt;code&gt;create database jmeter_t2&lt;/code&gt;
View databases: &lt;code&gt;show databases&lt;/code&gt;
Switch to database: &lt;code&gt;use jmeter_t2&lt;/code&gt;
Create user: &lt;code&gt;create user &amp;quot;admin&amp;quot; with password &#39;admin&#39; with all privileges&lt;/code&gt;
View users: &lt;code&gt;show users&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the user permissions for &lt;code&gt;admin&lt;/code&gt; are displayed as &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, the database setup is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grafana&#34;&gt;Grafana
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing test cases, it was found that the chart visualization effect is not really necessary; the &lt;code&gt;tps&lt;/code&gt; data from the interface can be observed when executed from the command line. The primary goal is to understand the internal latency of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple deployment of the Grafana console panel and importing a configuration file to connect with InfluxDB was performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The console supports filtering test results by tags, generally requiring only configuring one &lt;code&gt;InfluxDB&lt;/code&gt; database:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application Name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Case Name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/linux-setup-jmeter-testing-environment/Snipaste_2021-03-09_19-44-22.png&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;241&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;578px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the sampling interval in the web version, the calculated &lt;code&gt;TPS&lt;/code&gt; and related values are inconsistent with the JMeter aggregated report. Please refer to the following link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.vinsguru.com/jmeter-real-time-results-influxdb-grafana/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.vinsguru.com/jmeter-real-time-results-influxdb-grafana/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation also describes how to customize the &lt;code&gt;listeners&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-performance program patterns invariably are one-loop thread; any locks, enqueueing, and dequeueing will cause unnecessary performance loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time spent on core business logic is greater than the time spent introducing other code; concurrency can effectively improve efficiency only when the core latency is sufficiently large; otherwise, it’s best to be cautious about introducing other code.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Red Hat and CentOS Lifecycle</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/redhat-centos-lifecycle/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 20:02:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/redhat-centos-lifecycle/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Production environment operating systems, with Red Hat and CentOS being the mainstream choices. The documentation includes links to two system lifecycles and shares experience upgrading from CentOS 8 to CentOS Stream 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current domestic environment, Red Hat and CentOS are the mainstream choices for production online operating systems. After experiencing the retirement of Red Hat 6 two years ago, this record specifically documents the official website links for the lifecycles of these two systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-content&#34;&gt;Main Content
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wiki.centos.org/zh/About/Product&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;CentOS Product Specifications&lt;/a&gt;
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS are the mainstream choices for enterprise servers. RHEL provides stable support and update cycles, suitable for enterprise applications. CentOS as RHEL&amp;rsquo;s community edition, offers similar features and stability but without official support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;follow-up&#34;&gt;Follow-up
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When publishing this article, I didn’t expect to update it two years later. Just a few days ago, I upgraded my daily virtual machine from CentOS 8 to CentOS 8 Stream. I can&amp;rsquo;t say much about what to choose in production – I prefer to keep the latest version in my local environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentOS 8 Stream is a rolling release version that offers faster updates and new features than traditional CentOS, making it suitable for development and testing environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with some tangential points – the differences between Chinese-style socialism and capitalism, from the perspective of older generations who said that to get rich, you first needed to build roads. China’s infrastructure construction – these things are all funded by the state, whereas in a capitalist society, they would be contracted out. In remote areas, there’s no profit motive, so companies wouldn&amp;rsquo;t willingly take on those projects. There’s a lot of rambling going on here, and it’s starting to drift away from the current topic. Ordinary people might think trade wars don’t have much impact on their lives, but in reality, China’s high-end manufacturing has always been relatively weak. The IT industry I work in – memory, hard drives, CPUs, graphics cards – configuring a computer requires core components sourced from overseas factories. These parts account for 50% of the total cost, and the development of high-end manufacturing is essential. The collision between China and the United States is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Trade War Between the US and China Starting in 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%88%B6%E9%80%A02025&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Made in China 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;2018-2020 China–United States trade war, often referred to as the “China–United States trade war” (English: China–United States trade war), or simply “US–China trade dispute,” “US–China trade friction,” “US–China trade conflict,” or “US-China trade war,” was a trade war between the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China and the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade dispute originated when U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on March 22, 2018, claiming that &amp;ldquo;China is stealing American intellectual property and trade secrets,&amp;rdquo; and invoking Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose tariffs on goods imported from China, covering a total value estimated at $600 billion. On July 6, 2018, the United States imposed additional tariffs of 25% on $340 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia-1&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States and China had reached an agreement in May 2018 to temporarily suspend the trade war, and issued a joint statement seeking reconciliation. However, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced its first list of tariffs on Chinese goods shipped to the US on June 16th, raising the existing 10% tariff rate to 25%. The China Tariff Committee subsequently retaliated with equivalent measures, and the Ministry of Commerce of China also restarted anti-dumping investigations into various U.S.-bound products. On July 6th, the Trump administration formally imposed a 25% customs duty on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the US from the first list of tariffs, marking the formal implementation of Trump’s trade policy towards China (the remaining $16 billion in goods were subsequently subject to a 25% tariff on August 23rd). The Ministry of Commerce of China stated afterward, “The United States has violated WTO rules and launched what is now the largest trade war in economic history.” According to the General Administration of Customs of China, the Chinese side immediately implemented counter-measures following the implementation of US tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 1st, during the G20 Buenos Aires Summit, leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump reached an agreement to hold a 90-day negotiation and suspend new trade measures during that period. After the deadline of March 1st, 2019 expired, the US side announced significant progress and extended the suspension of new trade measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia-2&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 5, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the imposition of a 25% tariff on approximately $200 billion in Chinese goods, totaling $250 billion, as part of a trade war. The measure took effect on June 1st. On May 13th, China’s Tariff Policy Commission announced that starting June 1st, it would increase tariffs on some imported goods originating in the United States valued at $60 billion to a range of 5% to 25%. On June 1st, the U.S. Trade Representative&amp;rsquo;s Office announced a postponement of the imposition of a 25% tariff on U.S. products until June 15th. China’s Tariff Policy Commission stated that China’s retaliatory tariffs would take effect as scheduled on June 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 29th, the leaders Xi Jinping and Trump held talks at the G20 Osaka Summit, agreeing to resume economic negotiations. The United States agreed not to impose new tariffs on Chinese products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia-3&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 1st, due to the Trump administration’s dissatisfaction with China’s purchasing process of American agricultural products, Trump announced on Twitter that starting September 1st, 2019, tariffs of 10% would be imposed on all US goods imported from China worth $300 billion. On August 5th, the Renminbi exchange rate against the dollar fell below the 7-yuan mark. The same day, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it was designating China as a currency manipulator. Subsequently, the Chinese government announced a suspension of purchases of American agricultural products and on August 24th announced tariffs of 10% or 5% on approximately $750 billion worth of US goods, and restored tariffs on U.S. automobiles and their parts; while the U.S. increased the tariff rate on its $300 billion Chinese goods to 15%, and the current $250 billion Chinese goods to 25% as a countermeasure, but it was subsequently shelved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 16th, 2020, China and the United States signed a Phase One trade agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building PCs</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/computer-assembly-tips/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 14:33:46 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/computer-assembly-tips/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The author has long had an interest in building computers from a young age, and began to delve into hardware assembly after university. They recommended websites for comparing hardware performance and offered purchasing suggestions, including CPU, solid-state drives, hard disk drives, and memory frequencies. They also shared their experience and advice regarding hardware selection and important considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wonder--unspeakable&#34;&gt;Wonder – Unspeakable
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was young, I’d dreamed of building my own computer, but unfortunately, economic conditions didn&amp;rsquo;t allow it. Finally, after a lot of hard work, I managed to get to university, and I configured a laptop for portability. If I had to pinpoint the exact time when I started thinking about assembling computers, it would be when I began browsing the library in my hometown. After all, it was a sizable city-level library, with not only an electronic reading room (which I never actually visited – supposedly you were charged by the hour), but also a magazine reading room, where I discovered magazines like &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;. For someone who had limited exposure to computers, these were practically divine科普资料 (scientific explanation/learning materials). - When I read about players tackling dungeons, I started thinking about getting my own computer and going to pull monsters myself as the main damage dealer. Seeing the use of black technology, I fantasized about following the instructions in the book and achieving the described effect (regarding the use of hacking tools). Although my high school studies were heavy, with my limited understanding at the time, reading and playing were both necessary – it was a truly innocent and carefree experience. I would make an excuse to go to the library to read, and when nothing else to do, I’d carry a small bag and walk there; the city wasn&amp;rsquo;t that big, so I usually walked to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I got there, I enjoyed the air conditioning while reading novels, comics, and game magazines, occasionally even delving into more serious books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s easy for older people to forget things, and the initial spark of the library experience wasn&amp;rsquo;t a surprise. Years later, I couldn’t remember the computer my relatives had assembled during their time – I didn’t know what it was used for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wonder--unspeakable-1&#34;&gt;Wonder – Unspeakable
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon entering junior high school, the school offered introductory computer training, and later I transferred schools, where I also gained some exposure to concepts in computer competitions. After reaching high school, I qualified for NOIP once. Speaking of which, we must mention the power of our alumni; the high school’s computer building was donated by alumni and included a computer teaching room plus a library. Back then, it was also the initial wave of China&amp;rsquo;s internet boom. School leaders supported participation in computer competitions as well, considering that several senior classmates had been admitted to key universities through computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never reflected on my relationship with computers like this before. It’s no wonder that after graduating, I resolutely switched from automation to the computer industry – the seed had already been planted, and it was simply a matter of an insider not realizing it. Having encountered many things from a young age, I thought I was very skilled, but in reality, I only understood the superficial aspects; my biggest advantage was the initial passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hardware-assembly&#34;&gt;Hardware Assembly
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browse sites like Carda, Chiphell, and Zhihu’s computer assembly forums to get a newbie relatively simple list of components they would need for their own machine. After 2019, when purchasing CPUs with limited financial resources, AMD is the preferred choice for higher performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend a commonly used hardware performance comparison website: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/&lt;/a&gt;. For pricing, you can compare it to the US versions available on Xianyu (a Chinese online marketplace). True experts can go to Xianyu to find secondhand items, which can be significantly cheaper. If you’re not very familiar with this, I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend buying from Xianyu; I purchased fake memory, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t found any issues using it so far, and I’m not entirely sure about its specifications – the model and parameters don’t match at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sn550-vs-sn750&#34;&gt;SN550 VS SN750
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between the SN550 1TB and the SN750 1TB is that they consistently read and write slower by a factor of two – one reads at 850MB, while the other reads at 1.6GB. However, for everyday use, there’s no noticeable difference because both support 4K equally. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;m referring to the 1TB capacity SN550; speeds are significantly slower in sequential read/write operations for the 500G and 250G versions. In my opinion, if you&amp;rsquo;re not a spendthrift, buying the SN550 is sufficient – my main reason for not purchasing it wasn’t its sequential read/write speed, but rather that it only comes in a 1TB capacity, while the SN750 offers 2TB. For me, considering I don’t want to expand further, my motherboard&amp;rsquo;s M.2 NVMe interface is more valuable than these SSD differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on consensus from online users, purchasing a conversion board – such as the B150 motherboard – can also support M.2 SSDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hard-disk-drive-selection&#34;&gt;Hard Disk Drive Selection
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the prices of hard disk drives are relatively stable. For users with large storage needs, it is necessary to select a suitable mechanical hard drive. We recommend enterprise-grade hard drives for users who frequently download resources. Common ones include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Western Blue Discs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seagate Exos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large capacity mechanical hard drives should be partitioned, and frequent download operations should be fixed on a specific partition. If bad sectors appear later, they can be concentrated in one partition, and the current partition can be discarded, which can effectively extend the lifespan of the mechanical hard drive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;memory-frequency&#34;&gt;Memory Frequency
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a daily usage perspective, frequency doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a significant impact on performance.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory timings (also known as RAM timings) are four parameters that describe the performance of Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM): CL, TRCD, TRP, andTRAS, measured in clock cycles. They are typically written as four numbers separated by hyphens, such as 7-8-8-24. The fourth parameter (RAS) is often omitted, and sometimes a fifth parameter is added: Command rate (command rate), usually 2T or 1T, also written as 2N or 1N. These parameters specify the latency (delay time) that affects the speed of random access memory. Lower numbers generally indicate better performance. The final determining element for system performance is the actual latency time, typically measured in nanoseconds. When converting memory timing to actual latency, it’s crucial to note that it’s measured in clock cycles. Without knowing the clock cycle time, you cannot determine if one set of numbers is faster than another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;memory-frequency-1&#34;&gt;Memory Frequency
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the clock frequency of DDR3-2000 memory is 1000 MHz, with a clock cycle of 1 ns. Based on this 1 ns clock, a CL7 value gives an absolute latency of 7 ns. A faster DDR3-2666 (clocking at 1333 MHz, with each cycle 0.75 ns) might use a larger CL9 to produce a shorter absolute latency of 6.75 ns.
Modern DIMMs include a Serial Presence Detect (SPD) ROM chip containing recommended memory timings for auto-configuration. The PC&amp;rsquo;s BIOS may allow users to adjust timings to improve performance (with the risk of instability), or in some cases, increase stability (such as using suggested timings).
Note: Memory bandwidth is measured as throughput and is typically limited by transfer rate rather than latency. By interleaving multiple internal banks of SDRAM, it’s possible to transmit data at peak rates continuously. - This may increase bandwidth at the cost of increased latency. Specifically, each new generation of DDR memory has a higher transfer rate but with no significant change in absolute latency, particularly for the initial batches of new products from the market, which often exhibit longer delays than previous generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with increased memory latency, increasing memory bandwidth can improve the performance of multi-processor or multi-threaded computer systems. Higher bandwidth will also boost the performance of integrated graphics cards that do not have dedicated video memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Website Acceleration and Domain Settings</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/website-acceleration-and-domain-setup/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 10:36:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/website-acceleration-and-domain-setup/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to slow access to GitHub Pages from within the country, the author applied for a personal domain and purchased CDN acceleration services from a domestic cloud host provider. During configuration, the author encountered an issue where the www subdomain could not be accessed, which was ultimately resolved by deleting the generic domain DNS record and setting up a second-level domain separately. The author also shared the principles and configuration experience of CDN acceleration, as well as attempts and lessons learned using Nginx reverse proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, and due to some well-known reasons, accessing GitHub Pages internally can be slow. Therefore, I applied for a personal domain name and purchased CDN acceleration services from a domestic cloud host provider. When configuring the acceleration service, I thought about my development machine, which deployed Docker, frp, k8s, and other services – all of these had accompanying dashboards. Following the principle of not wasting anything, I configured several reverse proxies, all with second-level domain names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was happily using the second-level domain names, I suddenly discovered that the www subdomain could no longer be accessed. In Aliyun, I configured DNS to resolve both &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.xiangtianlong.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;www.xiangtianlong.com&lt;/a&gt; and xiangtianlong.com, and before enabling CDN acceleration, both domains were working normally. When configuring CDN acceleration, due to a large number of second-level domains, we enabled wildcard domain rules and unified routing them to the development machine. As a result, the ‘www’ second-level domain also went down – yes, you read that right, the ‘www’ prefix is indeed a second-level domain. The actual website is deployed on GitHub Pages, and the development machine has no cached website information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for why the site wasn&amp;rsquo;t deployed to the development machine, it was because it was a static blog, paired with GitHub’s provided action that automatically integrates publishing – seriously delicious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;domain&#34;&gt;Domain
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-professional web development, the understanding of domains does not involve SEO or cross-origin issues. As a blog site, a bare domain easily highlights the blogger&amp;rsquo;s site, such as myself who uses Chinese Pinyin as my domain name, and given that mobile access is now more prevalent, it’s preferable to input fewer characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keyboard shortcuts can be used on desktop to avoid entering “www” and “com”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cdn&#34;&gt;CDN
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used both Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud, and it’s easy for newcomers to get started. Tencent Cloud also has separate video explanations of the related concepts. The principle of CDN acceleration is similar to that of a JD.com warehouse: new products are shipped in advance to warehouses across China, and when delivery requests are triggered, they are distributed locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Origin Address: The address where the original website resources are stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache file settings: Using F12 in your browser’s developer console to analyze static and dynamic resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All 0 days validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.php;.jsp;.asp;.aspx&lt;/code&gt; 0 days validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.jpg;.png;.js;.css;.woff2&lt;/code&gt; 1 day validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tencent Cloud configuration rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can configure up to 10 cache expiration rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The priority of multiple cache expiration rules is bottom-first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache expiration time can be set up to a maximum of 365 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;miserable-confession&#34;&gt;Miserable Confession
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had never used Nginx before, assuming I could figure out reverse proxy configuration by simply searching for website information. The result was quite chaotic; I struggled for half a day without even getting a 302 redirect to work. So, I decided to take a brute-force approach – deleting wildcard domain resolution patterns in DNS and setting up individual second-level domains. Suddenly, I noticed that Alibaba Cloud DNS had a &amp;ldquo;Display URL Redirect&amp;rdquo; feature, which worked perfectly as a 302 redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting the first second-level domain normally, when I tried to set the second one, it didn&amp;rsquo;t work, and I almost lost my mind.  I waited for a while, and then it suddenly started working – apparently, Alibaba Cloud DNS sometimes has hiccups with its DNS propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zhihu.com/question/20414602&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Why are more and more website domain names not prefixed with &amp;ldquo;www&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.cloudxns.net/Support/detail/id/918.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between domains with and without “www”?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Blog IDE Environment and Ramblings</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-ide-environment-and-ramblings/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 13:54:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/blog-ide-environment-and-ramblings/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This article introduces the basic concepts of Markdown and its applications in various software, recommends using VSCode as an IDE, and lists recommended plugins. The author shares their experience switching from Hexo to Hugo, emphasizing Hugo’s flexibility and customization capabilities. Finally, it provides some suggestions for quickly getting started with new technologies and shares a trick for resolving the issue of Hugo theme styles not updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lightweight markup language that allows people to write documents in an easy-to-read and -write plain text format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;markdown-1&#34;&gt;Markdown
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed Markdown syntax will not be elaborated upon in this document. We recommend an ebook, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://markdown-zh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;. Many software applications on the market now support MD as a writing format. The csdn blog system has launched an online editor that supports MD syntax; the first time you use it, there is a default introduction article about MD syntax, which I think is quite good. iNotes added support for MD notes in 2018, with various MD markers in the shortcut bar, and it&amp;rsquo;s almost as easy to use as editing a regular article. The overall interaction process is friendly to beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ide-recommendations&#34;&gt;IDE Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing this article, it’s already 2020 – you’ve undoubtedly heard of VS Code, after all, anyone thinking about using Git Page to build a blog system is an industry professional. In the early years, Sublime and Atom were also good choices. With two years of promotion from the open-source community, VS Code has developed rapidly and has gradually become the preferred choice for newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Microsoft’s giant and the open-source community has successfully transitioned into a honeymoon phase: embracing open source. Our company has also actively introduced the Java ecosystem in recent two years, meaning that in business development, Java&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem is currently very fragrant domestically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vs-code-plugin-recommendations&#34;&gt;VS Code Plugin Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/blog-ide-environment-and-ramblings/2020-03-31-14-07-17.png&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;101&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;243px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All plugins have their own Readme files, introducing basic usage, core functions, and some authors even provide dynamic effect demonstration images.
&lt;code&gt;Paste Image&lt;/code&gt;, combined with Hugo&amp;rsquo;s image plugin method, is very convenient for importing images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t remember the shortcuts, open the VS Code shortcut management menu, search for “md”, read it several times; review it again to look at the plugin usage instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I switched from Hexo to Hugo, as I love tinkering – it’s just my nature! Ultimately, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the urge to quietly write articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo supports placing images and Markdown documents in a single folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Academic theme supports various article styles in its design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various convenient customization extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;academic&#34;&gt;academic
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The default website is &lt;code&gt;exampleSite&lt;/code&gt;, and menu introduction uses the &lt;code&gt;#component&lt;/code&gt; method, it’s recommended to use &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The URL pattern allows navigation links to jump to a single page instead of scrolling on the homepage – this is purely a matter of personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Styles: Notebooks, Speeches, eBooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility: Customization of overall style and custom CSS styles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme’s Chinese support isn&amp;rsquo;t very complete; primarily from a visual perspective, the font sizes don’t align well with Chinese reading habits. The Hexo development team is largely comprised of Chinese developers, which is an advantage over Hugo in this regard. However, it’s rewarding to do things yourself and customize – browser element auditing. When you locate an element, to find out the CSS style name you need to modify, click &lt;strong&gt;Insert Style Rule Below&lt;/strong&gt; on the sidebar, even with nested CSS layers, you can easily get the node name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[Introduce &lt;code&gt;custom.css&lt;/code&gt;](https://sourcethemes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;academic-1&#34;&gt;academic
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in syntax highlighting settings, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/#highlighting-options.&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;official link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kids are complaining again, saying you talk in such a vague and unclear way, without mentioning any details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to say is that with these things, you have enough to work with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Official Manuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugin Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When quickly getting started with new technologies, it’s recommended to first read the official website documentation, &lt;strong&gt;scanning through&lt;/strong&gt; – not necessarily reading it cover to cover, but at least having a general idea. Search engine results may not always be consistent with the latest version and could potentially mislead you. Similarly, when reviewing a new book, start by looking at the table of contents to understand what the author intends to discuss; sometimes, reading the introduction first is beneficial, especially with translated foreign books where the translator’s preface often covers the core content of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-eggs&#34;&gt;Easter Eggs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching the Hugo Academic built-in style and theme, publishing to the site, and accessing it did not result in a change of style. A clever teammate already figured this out – clearing the local browser cache resolved the issue.  It was then that I, with my ingenuity, used Developer Mode (F12), switched to &lt;code&gt;network&lt;/code&gt;, checked “disable cache,” refreshed, and voila!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Automatic System Switchover</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/auto-integration-system-switch/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your Hugo blog to GitHub Pages and Gitee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;background-introduction&#34;&gt;Background Introduction
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday while updating the blog, I discovered that the travis service was unavailable. Upon checking the travis webpage, I noticed the progress was stuck during source code retrieval, and a flash of inspiration hit me – I thought about GitHub’s previously launched action service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was quite busy, and also needed to apply to use action. Now that it has officially gone live, I have some free time over the weekend and wanted to try out a new toy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official documentation can be found by entering the website yourself; this article will not do much more copying and pasting. If you’ve used Kubernetes before, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that the action YAML file configuration is very similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding introductory tutorials or Chinese introduction materials, I recommend searching for &lt;strong&gt;阮一峰’s blog&lt;/strong&gt;. There are two articles – the first introduces the basic syntax, and the second provides a practical case study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;#### Content

Knowledge Points Needed
- GitHub Secrets
- Action Syntax
The core job uses existing components to complete the task, and pushing to the domestic Gitee is implemented using commands. This command approach is quite brute force, as it performs forceful pushes, inheriting the logic used with Travis.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the actions provided by the official market, currently there are quite a few supported playstyles. After building a Docker image, it’s no longer dependent on services offered by Docker Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the Hugo issues, using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy Git Pages results in the final published website needing to be on the master branch. If deployed from another branch, the settings interface will prompt an error indicating that the deployed webpage has syntax problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is simply because Hugo’s source files are located on the master branch, and GitHub treats it as the Jelly blog&amp;rsquo;s source code for detection, unable to check and resolve any errors resulting in the error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is straightforward: move Hugo source files to another branch and publish static files to the master branch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The future of China will undoubtedly be a China of good elders and good old people.</title>

        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 11:28:28 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/future-china-with-good-grandparents/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hope that twenty years from now, I’ll be a cute old man, spending time with a cute old woman. I don&amp;rsquo;t seek great wealth or status; just to be healthy and strong enough to travel and explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video-transcript&#34;&gt;Video Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to Youku Search, and no further links will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said that in 10 years, I’d be a charming old man, and I would work hard to become a charming old man. The future of China will definitely have good old men and women. Even if I&amp;rsquo;m 60 in 10 years, I’ll be the youngest in the world’s third-rate society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, if everyone sees 50-year-old Chinese men with this physique, it would be pretty impressive. But behind this physique is a saying I believe: the more disciplined you are, the freer you become! When the rain stops, I want to go running; tomorrow afternoon I’ll play soccer. At 50 years old, I can still play big games – it&amp;rsquo;s not a joke, and I often play with professionals. But what’s behind all of this? “Behind it is autonomy. The remaining days I spend running, and people might find that very monotonous. The more disciplined you are, the freer you become. Because of my discipline, I can run freely, never listening to music – because I feel my own breath is the most beautiful music while running.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-1&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I rarely run on the treadmill. Also, many people in Beijing experience smog as severe as that, so I run five days a week, with two days dedicated to the smog. And unlike others, I jokingly say it’s probably because I never stop. Each month, I record my runs in my journal – drawing one day for every day of experience, at least 18 days per month. When running, they just flash by; I don&amp;rsquo;t even wear glasses while running, but more importantly, I still kick a ball every week. My graduate students’ last lecture was always held at our home—on the theme of “fun.” I find fun incredibly important, and I never engage with people who lack joy or hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I first started teaching a few years ago, one of my graduate students was featured in &lt;em&gt;China News Weekly&lt;/em&gt;. We had a special issue called “Zhi” (致 – meaning “letter to”), and ten years later, when my student graduated each year, the final assignment he would complete was writing an article for me ten years down the line. I’d keep it, and then I’d gradually develop it with them as they progressed, including writing one myself at 50 for those turning 60 – something I never imagined happening so far away, beyond the map. But suddenly, it became my next stop: writing to 20-year-olds for 30-year-olds. That was a love letter written in spring, but my 50-year-old piece for 60 was more like summer’s farewell whispered to autumn – a private monologue. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m writing to them ten years later, slowly constructing it from all over the world, as if crafting it for their own bed, a meal, and the presence of their family. This feels entirely natural.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-2&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what kind of person will I be at 60 years old? My topic is very clear: In a pleasant introduction, this article is long. I say that in 10 years, I will be a lovable old man, and I want to work hard to become a lovable old man. China wanting to be lovable isn&amp;rsquo;t just about having more like-minded citizens who become citizens, not just ordinary young people, energetic young people who understand the rules, young people who will make a good China in the future. Currently, over 60 million people in China have already exceeded 2.3 billion, and it will definitely exceed three billion within 10 years. That means that solely based on the population of those over 60, China could be among the top five or even third countries in the world. Think about how frightening that is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t feel that way myself. - I don’t know if everyone has seen the online table today listing the average lifespans of all provinces and municipalities in China. Shanghai and Beijing both exceed 80 years, including an average for both men and women. Naturally, men still have a significant disadvantage in terms of lifespan. That means that even if I&amp;rsquo;m 60 years old in ten years, I’d be one of the youngest in this world. Looking ahead… If women retire at 55 and live another 25 years until an average age of 80, and men retire at 60 and live another 20 years until an average age of 80! You need to do something other than just dancing square dances. And I can say that the grandmothers and uncles who dance square dances today are cultural habits and entertainment methods brought about by the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-3&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in 20 years, the next generation may still have many people dancing square dances, but they will be significantly reduced. This is because the next generation are no longer active participants in collective activities, just like older generations who enjoy traveling in tour groups – now young people are increasingly choosing independent and self-guided travel. Square dancing will continue to exist in the future, but its scope will undoubtedly shrink; there’s neither good nor bad about this, it&amp;rsquo;s simply a reshuffling of the times as it constantly evolves. When I was 60, I was one of the youngest members of the team. What kind of person should I be? The Chinese saying goes that 60 is when your ears become attuned – I believe I wouldn’t have listened to anything and been happy, even when I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been, and even then I would have felt unhappy. More importantly, what should I do for the young people! What should we do for good things? - Not lazy, not easily compromising; it’s important to oppose when necessary. Young people could harm his interests – can you stand in front of them? I&amp;rsquo;ve been constantly looking at this mirror lately. My good friend, Tao Wei, used to often gather with us, including at our home, and he once told me a genuine story. We collectively mourned together. The older generation, like Chen Lao Dai, kept everything stored within their homes, saying things out of the blue, hiding 30-odd items under the bed – you need to tell him that this garment cost over 500 yuan, and then we started supporting him financially, lighting incense every day. Therefore, this generation has grown accustomed to battling our parents for knowledge and wisdom; how much did a garment costing over 700 yuan cost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-4&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;220&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But it’s easy to get into trouble. Tao Wei once bought a T-shirt for his dad for over 400 yuan. That T-shirt was really good, how much did it cost? “99,” I wore it. The next day, disaster struck. When he came back in the evening, he praised Tao Wei for taking a picture and giving him 400 yuan, asking him to buy four more for me. Afterwards, everyone who saw me wearing it, including Zhang and Li Da Ye, thought it was great, and then said that the risk of lying like this was very large. In the future, you shouldn’t do this. I don&amp;rsquo;t specifically mention which person was in the orthopedic department of the hospital when an elderly person fractured a bone, and the most important reason was discovered – they bought shoes from a street stall. Of course, I’m only talking about this on a material level; even as we get older, we still need mental stimulation, curiosity, and a willingness to shield young people from the wind and rain, living each day happily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very curious and excitedly waiting for my 60th birthday to arrive, because I think it’s the beginning of a beautiful time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My 18 years old is probably different from yours.</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The very common phrase &lt;strong&gt;information fragmentation&lt;/strong&gt; – since graduating from high school, aside from the time I spent reading novels, I haven’t really taken the time to sit down and read a book quietly and attentively for a long time. Sometimes, looking back, after so many years working, I still remember what I did each year? Often, by the middle of the year, I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten a lot of things from the first half. Writing a blog is a good habit, even though much of what I write isn’t appropriate and doesn’t matter – it was originally written for myself to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most loyal readers are myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of one’s 18 years is like a gaze of expectation and questioning. Each person occasionally takes their own 18th birthday to ask themselves, “Are you the way you wanted to live back then?” I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that nowadays everyone has countless circles, no friends, chatting all day long, nobody to have a heart-to-heart conversation, knowledge acquisition is endless, but far from wisdom. Everyone should use your 18th birthday to ask yourself, it’s too easy to deceive others, but very difficult to deceive yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think each of one’s 18 years is like a gaze of expectation and questioning. You can deceive others, but you cannot deceive your 18-year-old self. Is today you the way you were going to be at 18? I think it&amp;rsquo;s okay. - Today, material fame and countless other things are valued far more than what I, at 18, could have imagined. However, on the other hand, we’re always moving forward. When I was 18, I was studying journalism at the Broadcasting Academy, and I wanted to become like Farquhar – the best journalist. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m still on that path, which is why many people say, “How can White still be on CCTV?” because I want to be a good journalist. The pursuit of news continues. This is my 18-year-old perspective, so I think everyone should occasionally ask themselves: Are you the person you originally wanted to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-1&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something you can’t fool anyone with. This is what I looked like at 18, and it&amp;rsquo;s just gone in an instant – 32 years have passed. Every student who came to Beijing to study at that time would have this same photo. Back then, the crumpled suits on Tianmen Square, the school badge pinned to your chest – because there were so few university students back then, no badges, you felt incredibly proud. We had long hair back then, but we still loved our 18-year-old selves. Looking back after all these years, I suddenly realize that I’m grateful for the things I faced at 18, because they shaped me silently. It was May 8th, 1986, and I bought a selection of Misty Poems at Wangfujing Bookstore that year. And today, I suddenly realized that my writing style has been most influenced by Cui Jian’s “One Evening,” which I heard at the Workers&amp;rsquo; Stadium. It’s had the biggest impact on me – including the fact that my personality was shaped by Misty Poetry, rock music, and Lu Guofu’s martial arts novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did you go through at 18? Here’s the English translation of the provided text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You might carry what essentials you need for a trip. I especially want to know what 18-year-olds are experiencing today? Are they being carved away like with an axe, relentlessly shaping themselves? But what tools did he use? What kind of image did it create? I’m afraid that everyone now has countless social media circles, yet no one has a genuine friend to talk to. Knowledge acquisition is limitless, but far from wisdom – knowing everything and yet knowing nothing. It seems like everyone is claiming to be unique, but as an observer, I find that young people are remarkably similar. What should I put them through at 18? I really admire 1986 because it’s the best way to resolve 1966.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-2&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1966, the Cultural Revolution ended after 76 years of defeating the Gang of Four – it was largely accidental. It could only be truly achieved through the enlightenment and awakening of human nature and the growth of every individual. I believe we still need to go through a period of enlightenment and fully understand human nature. Regardless of how much economic progress China makes, if we don’t genuinely fill in this understanding of humanity – then guide it, control its darker side, and activate its good side – there will continue to be many things to worry about in the future. So my 18th year was also representative of that era; it went too far, but we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t forget why we started out. It’s now been condensed into these four words: “Don’t Lose Your Original Intent.” So, I think regardless of how far you go, everyone should ask themselves what their 18-year-old self would think. It’s good to keep a photo from that time and often ask yourself, “What do others say? Does it matter?” It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to fool others than to fool yourself. I just said to a 20-year-old today, based on my own 18 years, you should always let your 18-year-old be the eyes watching you. And as I also mentioned earlier, in your twenties, go try many doors – you don’t know which one is right for you. It&amp;rsquo;s surprising in China now to often see older people in their twenties and lots of younger people in their seventies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This excerpt recounts the author’s perspective on the profession of journalism, emphasizing that reporters should possess a social conscience, extensive knowledge, and perseverance. The author also shares their reflections at age 50, including maintaining curiosity, balancing material and spiritual pursuits, and contemplating the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best journalist is first, having a social conscience; second, possessing knowledge; and third, being able to run long distances. I couldn’t handle running 100 meters – I ran it. I believe these three things combined, people expect the safety concerns surrounding vaccines to be completely resolved, just like with the formula milk scandal. We always solve problems after they arise, completely resolving them, and moving forward in this logical cycle. Otherwise, what is there for a journalist to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-1&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe the best journalist first has a social conscience, second has knowledge reserves, and third can run long distances – I’ve stopped being intimidated by 100 meters; I&amp;rsquo;ve been running. I think these three things combined explain why I feel suited to journalism at my age of 50. I’m naturally intertwined with China’s reform for the past 40 years. When I turned 30, standing on the banks of the Songhua River, and when I turned 40, my birthday coincided with the 2008 Olympics – I went in during the live broadcast and came out during the broadcast. Now at 50, as the nation commemorates 40 years of reform and opening up, it’s certainly a corresponding moment: if the “Great Era” is at 40, what about China&amp;rsquo;s reform at 40 – is it a period of confusion or enlightenment? “Looking at China after 40 years of development, it has already given people and the country a tremendous amount in terms of material wealth. However, anxiety and confusion have increased rather than decreased. We thought that becoming strong and wealthy meant everything was okay, but we realized that material prosperity is just a foundation. It’s easy to escape poverty materially, but truly becoming prosperous spiritually and emerging as a major power is incredibly difficult. The United States is now targeting our high-tech industries – we need to target agricultural products. There&amp;rsquo;s always this saying in the world: it&amp;rsquo;s hard for number two to become number one! How many ‘second’ iPhones did America fix? Therefore, we must undergo a long period of time transforming ‘number two’ into something that surpasses ourselves. I can’t get everything; I need to focus on what I can truly achieve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-2&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to start working in television at 25, beginning with person interviews. I came into contact with hundreds or even thousands of figures who carried various halos and reputations. Back then, as a young man, I thought these halos must have made them incredibly happy. But when I got closer, I realized no, the halos had little to do with their happiness, and sometimes they were even inversely proportional. Recently, I finished watching Guo Mo’er&amp;rsquo;s last 29 years. Guo Mo’er barely escaped persecution throughout his life, holding positions like Deputy Vice Premier, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC, and Honorary Vice Chairman. But did he find happiness? Did he have a happy life considering his two sons committed suicide and another was possibly pushed to death from a building?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you use to measure happiness? When you’re in your sixties or seventies, if you lose two sons in a few years, can that make you happy? “Having many famous calligraphy and paintings can bring happiness, allowing oneself to spend many years safely – what do you need? I think reading people is the best mirror. To put it briefly, I feel that much of our current anxiety comes from thinking too much and not reading enough books. This is Yang Geng Lan’s reply to a young man: if you don&amp;rsquo;t read books, you rely on fast food; just pick up a phone and try to find a quick fix. How can that be possible? I learned how to be clever through the slow, cumbersome process of reading a book; subtraction comes from reducing the number of books one reads – the more one reads, the less one needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-3&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I don’t expect everyone to be able to read the best version of themselves through reading, but I hope the proportion increases – that more and more Chinese people can develop themselves better through reading. No one sits on the ground and looks up at the sky, trying to figure out everything; I cannot do that. But I can look in a mirror. A few years ago, a BBC news anchor came to Beijing, claiming to be the BBC’s most outstanding news anchor, and a well-meaning person organized a dialogue between him and a Chinese news anchor at the International Hotel. During our conversation, he asked me a question: “Do you think the BBC should learn from CCTV?” I first made a joke and said, &amp;ldquo;Of course, they should first learn Chinese.&amp;rdquo; Then, after making the joke, I said, &amp;ldquo;The BBC should most of all learn the world’s curiosity. We&amp;rsquo;ve rapidly gone to the world in recent years…&amp;rdquo; Here’s the English translation of the provided text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have various bureaus, currently exceeding 70. We feel that whenever a student sees something new from abroad, they are incredibly curious. We observe the world with this immense curiosity, and BBC has already considered Britain itself to be global – you&amp;rsquo;ve lost that sense of wonder. Older brother is right, what we lack is precisely this. In 2007, when I interviewed a Japanese writer for him, he said about Japan, ‘Besides lacking hope, it has everything else.’ Later, I realized the depth of his words. From another angle, ten years ago, I felt that China lacked everything except hope – everyone believed there was a future ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-4&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But won’t one day we also become a wealthy nation that only desires everything? To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m very worried that China will end up being a negative one – when you have everything, you realize how truly poor you are. When I’m 50 years old, I fear becoming someone who can satisfy all material conditions but is incredibly impoverished. In our reality, there are many highly educated people with no culture, and there are many poor people with countless numbers on their bank accounts – this is the problem of this era. True poverty isn&amp;rsquo;t frightening because there’s a forward direction and hope. This is why I say that a lack of morality and human flaws are the root causes. That’s why I think scientists invented so much not because they initially carried great missions, but out of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I figure out how to make it? “So I’ve always started to urge myself to be more curious around the age of 50, so I’m very happy. The one thing that’s currently bothering me is persistence. When you were just talking about ‘you’re still persisting,’ I said, ‘Don’t say that – once you persist, you’re close to death.’ We used to say that persistence equals success, and if Chinese football just persisted through the ‘black three minutes’ – if they just kept at it – it was all about perseverance. But without method or fun, it became a matter of simply persisting. Sometimes persistence is important, but often this saying has two sides. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that when I do something, like talking to people, I’ll persist and finish what I started, even though my time is now up. But I’m curious, and I want to see how my conversations with others will turn out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-5&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give yourself a very small keyword, but engage in conversations with people. I think that at 50 years old, as long as you can maintain a great deal of curiosity, there’s no problem, I like all fun things, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to be the most popular thing today. Today’s trends might disappear overnight. There are always trending words every year; do you remember some of them? Could some media on the internet 10 years from now become traditional media? So, fun things will always have their own inherent appeal, and I respect everyone&amp;rsquo;s likes – there must be a reason for it. But when you look at it in the long run, you’ll find that Chinese people still like to play mahjong the most. When you also like eating fast food, then restaurants serving large meals will naturally start to close down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things are not just about expressing feelings and moving on. How much fragmented reading do you get from your daily mobile phone use? How much longer-form reading do you have? But this is also a process, and the phone is becoming our handcuffs. So I feel that people are increasingly consuming shorter things, which leads to people gradually becoming short-sighted, but this is also a process – I never worry about content being king. It will always return. You’ll keep entertaining yourself to death every day, until you&amp;rsquo;re 40 years old, just like when I see teenagers drinking soda, and I try to tell them to drink less, but you know they will inevitably drink it. However, on the other hand, I’m optimistic – he will eventually return to the world of tea. This is a typical Chinese life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s perfectly normal, but I hope this transition happens faster. We’re just expressing an observation: investigative journalism has become so rare these days, and people don’t read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What will Chinese football be like in 20 years?</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The supplementary reader responses were largely written on a whim in 2021. The timing of Wang Yi’an’s speeches being transcribed was just as the pandemic was beginning. Don&amp;rsquo;t say twenty years later, or even one year or two later – the world is always beyond people’s expectations. Now that China’s epidemic has ended, overseas epidemics are still causing trouble. Regarding football, Chinese national team played quite well in recent years; the coach dared to give them free rein and attack, which was much better than when they were just starting out. Watching a national team game made even grandpa bored enough to change channels – what kind of experience is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you still curious about Chinese football? Curious, very curious, what could be any different? So you find that Chinese football plays badly because many people are afraid to lose the ball in their own area and pass it to others, so they’re done for themselves – there&amp;rsquo;s no such way of playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is just one of many small reasons. When talking about 20 years of football, 20 years from now China football seems incredibly distant. The first expansion became 48 teams, and it&amp;rsquo;s possible China might go, but it’s still possible they won’t. The best age range for a national team is 26-30; so 20 years from now that would be children aged 6 to 10 – I find that very optimistic, but 20 years later it will definitely work. When I talk about children aged 6-10 today, you immediately become serious. It’s cause and effect: what are we planting today? What kind of beans are we growing if we plant them today? We almost planted soybeans for the national team – what would they grow into? Whoever initiates this action, they should prepare to be removed from the game – it’s a violation of the rules, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t dwell on it. But you really should think about today’s children aged 6-10; are they playing soccer? You just know what Chinese football will be like in 20 years?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s the English translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To do things properly, first and foremost, you need to have a clear conscience. This allows you to sleep soundly, without minor ailments or major issues. It&amp;rsquo;s best to avoid making mistakes in the first place. If you do make a mistake, it should be about trying to rectify it, not concealing it or hoping to forget it yourself – humans are also capable of excellent memory. Inner peace is the destination; being able to answer your own questions with integrity allows you to live more lightly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have eight words to say that are quite heavy – I feel we’re currently experiencing a moral deficit, a depletion of human nature, and a logical cycle where problems arise and need to be solved, ultimately resolved completely. You need patience to wait for this process of upheaval. For a country like China, many things are a slow process of sorting out. So don&amp;rsquo;t be pessimistic about change; it’s undergoing a cleansing/reshuffle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, China has been battling two typhoons – one is intangible and the other is tangible. The intangible typhoon is the vaccine, which is impacting our inner security dam. The other typhoon hasn’t frequently landed in Shanghai, and hasn&amp;rsquo;t caused Beijing and Tianjin to suffer; it’s a rare event for three directly-administered cities to face a storm together that hasn’t occurred in decades. This is off-topic. What you’re going to be thinking about next is whether your own self-improvement and significant changes – having many answers – will make you happy if the surrounding environment remains unchanged. I have eight words to express this heavily: we currently suffer from a moral deficit and a loss of humanity, which is the biggest deficit and greatest loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-1&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, people were expecting the safety risks of vaccines to be completely resolved, just like with the initial formula scandal. So sometimes you need to look at history and understand that you know about the establishment and formation of a complete legal framework for the US Food and Drug Administration, which is closely related to the initial unsafe formula and dairy products. Therefore, the Sanlu milk powder incident forced China to undergo significant changes in the dairy industry. While vaccines aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be one after another, I hope this time it’s a halt. You need to know that times always move forward through a logical cycle of problems being identified and completely resolved, otherwise what do journalists do? What do citizens do?
I think we can all do is care. But the problem is that Chinese people are too easily forgetful. “As I just said, after hitting someone’s car and then speeding off the side of the road, a whole vehicle of people didn&amp;rsquo;t stop to intervene. A large proportion of our neighbors and colleagues are like that – people who behave this way. So we need to gradually change that. And as ordinary citizens, the things we can do is pay attention, not forget. I don’t think it’s a lack of something; when you’re hungry and cold, and you spend your days talking about ideals, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any persuasive power. But once they’ve eaten and are warm, if they let themselves become the world’s number one country for diabetes, number one for hypertension, and so many other ‘number one’ countries… then you’ll see Chinese people starting to run and start dieting. And when you ask the ladies in this audience, who hasn&amp;rsquo;t experienced the brutal experience of not being able to lose weight because I couldn’t afford a decent meal?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript-2&#34;&gt;Transcript
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spiritual aspect we’ve been discussing is also the same. When you’re well-fed and warm, and start running or dieting, your need for spirit will gradually increase as well. For example, I used to smoke, but one day after starting to run, I suddenly realized I hadn&amp;rsquo;t smoked in 20 days – not at all. I haven’t smoked since. Of course, I wouldn’t deliberately say, “I’ve completely quit!” because I think it lacks a certain ceremony; it doesn’t rule out smoking two or three cigarettes during the year. When your lifestyle changes, many things will change along with it. I believe that for Chinese people, you need to be patient and wait for the upheaval. More and more people feel unhappy and unwilling to indulge themselves in unhappiness. “While depression is increasing, on the other hand, isn’t it also seeing more and more people seeking positive ways to live? At this time, things related to the mental aspect will grow, so don&amp;rsquo;t be pessimistic; how you look at the same thing matters. I often see people cutting in line while driving, and I feel frustrated, but then I quickly become optimistic because the queue on the other side is longer than before. This is a process like this – all of you, gathered here tonight after the rain has stopped, willingly engaging in so much pointless conversation… isn’t that a wonderful thing?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also a transformation, so there are many things that need to be thought about in a different way. Of course, I think there will be much to learn in the future, such as when you talk about starting a business – is everyone an entrepreneur? Everyone’s life is an entrepreneurial one. We’re giving too much of a time-sensitive element to entrepreneurship, but entrepreneurship has always been around. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t Su Shi (Su Dongpo) an entrepreneur? Wasn&amp;rsquo;t Li Bai an entrepreneur? Everyone will have many innovations throughout their lives, and ultimately they created their own brand. It doesn’t matter if most innovations don’t come to fruition, as long as you live a life that is rich in flavor and you believe it’s worth it. I think China particularly lacks good failure as another value of success. People only accept successful outcomes, but a good failure is also a success, and we don&amp;rsquo;t accept that. “I think that’s going to be very difficult, so you see why Chinese football isn&amp;rsquo;t played well has many reasons, and one of those reasons is that everyone is afraid to lose the ball after passing it to someone else – they just let it go. If there wasn’t this kind of play, of course, that’s only a very small part of the reason. So I think as I get to my age, by 30, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to write about ‘Transparent Happiness’ and can’t be rushed, and now at 50, there’s a bit of urgency because time is passing so quickly, and you expect many things that haven’t become reality. But on the other hand, I also understand that for a country like China, many things are a slow shuffling process. You see older generations – some were completely oblivious to anything, but occasionally you&amp;rsquo;ll see children pulling their fathers along as they change. They’re changing, they’re being shuffled around, so I think you need to be patient.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In general, the country is getting better and stronger economically, becoming wealthier. This wouldn’t be true without the diminishing of personal vanity. Looking back from the 1990s to now, in the families I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered, people’s lives have generally improved significantly. Simultaneously, the number of wealthy individuals has increased. During the development of market-oriented economics, it is unavoidable that wealth gaps have widened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commonly discussed phenomena like class solidification and blocked upward mobility are global trends. The Communist Party’s contributions to basic welfare benefits and social security should also be noted. Things will get better and better, you don’t need to buy a house; you can rent one. Children&amp;rsquo;s education also faces issues with unequal resource allocation, sometimes requiring compromises – do you want better job opportunities, a better work environment, or more time to spend with family? Don’t impose your own ideas on others, including your child and family members. Sit down and talk it over; life will inevitably get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now 50 years old this year, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think about it in the past. I felt like an old man. Now I realize that I really am an old man. This is what I looked like at 30. When you’re 30, you don’t feel very young or beautiful, but when you look back at 50, it&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty good. What was the biggest life lesson at 30? Looking back. I think it’s subtraction – the key word is subtraction.  Some pain and happiness are also a kind of subtraction; you want to experience and write down many things, then leave them there, on a new blank sheet, or go for a run. But for me, at 30, I really feel that whether it&amp;rsquo;s for myself or for others, doing subtraction is very important. I’m currently a student carrying heavy loads – I often remind them, “Before you turn 30, you need to be adding relentlessly, trying things out; you don&amp;rsquo;t know what kind of possibilities you have, and you don&amp;rsquo;t know what opportunities fate will offer.” So it’s not about knowing, but some people are working tirelessly in their twenties, constantly adding, but they forget to subtract when they reach a certain point. I think around 30 is a very important time in life – after doing a series of additions and wandering around everywhere, you should take the time to subtract; otherwise, it’s too late. Why do you need to subtract? Not everything suits you, and not everything is suitable for you. You should try to do everything.
Eight lines are tethering you – how far can you run? They might hinder each other.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thirty-years-old-1&#34;&gt;Thirty Years Old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At thirty years old, I had been promoted to a full professorship – in academic terms. For journalism, it’s equivalent to a senior reporter. I was promoted to a full professorship at 29, and such promotions have become rare these days. However, at that time, I began to feel a tremendous sense of confusion. When the Sydney Olympics were held in 2000, I received a lot of applause, but suddenly I realized something wasn’t right. I started asking myself, “What exactly do you want to do? What things need to be discarded?” That year, I made a very important subtraction – I stopped my show and didn&amp;rsquo;t appear on television for a year, without any external appearances. People told me that as a host, you can get by if you don’t appear on screen for a month, but if you don’t appear for six months, no one will remember you. I said, “My face is quite valuable.” That year, I began to develop new programs. “This was after going through immense pain and joy, and in 2001, I stopped for an entire year. Everything I’m doing today is a reflection of that time – a process of simplification (doing less). Back then, I could do so much: I could pursue sports, I could get into E [likely referring to electronic music/entertainment], and many other fun things, even produce shows. But I said no. I realized I could only do journalism, and it was what I was truly meant to do. At the time, I was producing three segments, and I quit them all overnight, which led to who I am today. I became simpler. A few days ago, talking with colleagues, I even mentioned how a very important decision I made when I was in my thirties – not just because of all the opportunities available, but because I felt that I should simply stick to journalism, and this deep well [likely referring to dedication to the profession]… many positions could have promoted me to deputy director. I rejected it, and returned to a common citizen’s level.”&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, I’ve been working with provincial-level cadres and party officials, none of whom are exclusively graduates of undergraduate programs – they aren&amp;rsquo;t all solely from bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degrees among the masses. You understand our system, but I refuse to participate. I wanted to see how far a bachelor’s degree could take someone, and why a bachelor’s degree shouldn’t be limited to continuous learning and mentoring graduate students. Yes, I currently mentor 11 graduate students per year – this is a reduction in numbers. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a reflection on that feeling of looking back. Furthermore, when you&amp;rsquo;re young, you easily develop a sense of entitlement: “Everything I deserve, if something isn’t received, if something has a flaw, I feel particularly uncomfortable.” Please don’t any of you learn to cut corners either – that is, at the time when you’re about to turn 30 or 28 years old, watching the 1996 Olympics, I came up with a sentence: “Defects are an important part of perfection; there is no perfect world.” In Zeng Qianfen&amp;rsquo;s long novel, it actually wrote down a very important saying: what is the best state in life? Zeng Qianfen wanted to name his study room &amp;ldquo;Qiu Que Ting&amp;rdquo; – the flower hasn’t fully bloomed yet is the best. The moon hasn’t been completely round yet is the best. But for ordinary people, they will feel this is a defect, not perfect enough, not reaching the extreme, and the best way to ruin someone is to let them pursue perfection and reach the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thirty-years-old-3&#34;&gt;Thirty Years Old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This world isn’t like that. Flowers are most beautiful when they aren&amp;rsquo;t fully open; once they bloom completely, they’re close to falling. The moon is most beautiful when it’s full and round; as it slowly transforms into a waning crescent, it’s also approaching that point. Therefore, I feel this was a very important boost and revelation for me at 30. Forty isn&amp;rsquo;t as good-looking as that time. But I think I relaxed, became freer. Why shouldn’t I start asking about happiness instead of dressing in suits and ties or always looking formal?&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese people have a saying that 40 is not confused; 30 is subtraction, and 40 is confusion. It’s not about being unconfused, and I think in today&amp;rsquo;s era, 40-year-olds are the most confused. My midlife crisis came surprisingly early, starting around 36 or 37 years old when I began to question whether everything I had done was valuable and meaningful. What do I really want for happiness? This book was born out of this confusion. When you&amp;rsquo;re 30, you often find that your happiness goals are tied to material possessions. “Thirty and established” (三十而立) refers to having a solid education. You need a car, a house, otherwise your mother-in-law won’t consider marrying you off – it’s very materialistic, but 40 is difficult to be unconfused. I think ancient people likely had a longer average lifespan than we do now, so when they condensed it to 40 years, he wouldn’t be confused. I feel that way myself – at 40, I&amp;rsquo;m bewildered. &lt;strong&gt;Material things haven&amp;rsquo;t brought me happiness as I thought they would.&lt;/strong&gt; Similarly, when people ask you at 40, “Are you happy?” it’s often a question mark, representing the confusion within my heart. The emergence of midlife crisis: at 40, you need to answer yourself many questions, you need to talk to yourself more at around 40, you need to read a lot and give yourself some answers. I was very fortunate to have entered the world of the &lt;em&gt;Tao Te Ching&lt;/em&gt; when I was thirty-six or seventy years old. In &lt;em&gt;White Say&lt;/em&gt;, I had already discussed it, and at forty years old, when one is still contemplating things, if the surrounding environment doesn’t change, especially the soft environment – if you’re feeling relaxed and happy enough to step out of the house and wander around freely, like running through red lights – you’ll find that everything you buy is fake, and even getting a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forty-years-old-1&#34;&gt;Forty Years Old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been saying that China has been battling two typhoons these past few days – one typhoon was intangible, and the other was tangible. The intangible typhoon is vaccines; it’s attacking our inner security dam. The other typhoon, China rarely sees typhoons landing in Shanghai – that&amp;rsquo;s a distraction. Next, you need to think about whether you are only focusing on your own well-being, if you’ve undergone significant changes, and if you have many answers. If the surrounding environment doesn’t change, will you be happy? &lt;strong&gt;I have eight characters I say are quite heavy – I feel that we currently suffer from a moral deficit and a loss of humanity; this is the biggest deficit and greatest loss.&lt;/strong&gt; A few days ago, I witnessed a car accident not far from here. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that serious of a collision, and he was responsible for hitting another vehicle. He tried to explain to the other driver that we were planning to pull over to the side of the road, and the other driver slowly began preparing to do so. However, the lead vehicle sped off without stopping to help. There weren’t any people in it trying to restrain him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would that be a responsible father? Would that be a responsible son? And what about his responsibility as a citizen – it inevitably impacts you. You might be a big shot, but unless you haven&amp;rsquo;t stepped foot outside your home, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent your children from getting vaccinated. Even delivery services can have issues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forty-years-old-2&#34;&gt;Forty Years Old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If 30 is subtraction and 40 is confusion, I think 50 should be the word I give myself: curiosity. Fifty is awkward; neither forward nor backward has a village or shop to reach – advance, attack; retreat, blend in – it can also work. Spending ten years on something you’ve achieved, lingering until retirement, seems possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a book that contains some very interesting writing: it says that truly successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are often older, 50s and 60s. This is different from our concept. How can China ever stop viewing entrepreneurship as a young endeavor, just like how China shouldn’t view volunteers as youth volunteers? Last week I did a program about China recruiting retired primary and secondary school teachers – with an annual stipend of two or three hundred thousand yuan – to teach in rural areas, and they must be outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifty-years-old&#34;&gt;Fifty Years Old

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, for a 50-year-old person, there are two challenges: the first is yourself – are you still curious about many things? What is your worldview? I feel that my biggest gain at 50, or the way I’m living now, is to treat every day well. When you&amp;rsquo;re 20 years old, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to live in tomorrow; if you&amp;rsquo;re not careful, a 50-year-old tends to dwell on yesterday. But I try to restrain myself, neither living in tomorrow nor in the past. I treat each day well – a 50-year-old shouldn’t always say “we’ll talk about it tomorrow” or “things were better back then!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s best to watch Cai Qin’s concert discs today. Cai Qin said something that was quite profound: whenever he looks at old photos, he thinks he looked good two years ago. But on that particular day two years ago, he never thought he looked good before. That’s a really flavorful saying. “I didn’t realize it when I was 30, at that time I felt quite handsome. I thought I had a lot of flaws, but now, when I look back after 20 years, I realize… I was young once too. I had so much hair then, so cherish every day you have, and it would be best to see how you are two years from now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifty-years-old-1&#34;&gt;Fifty Years Old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Yu Shi-sheng said, when my legs first couldn’t walk, I sat in a wheelchair, constantly yearning for the time when I could run and play basketball. Every day, consumed by these memories, I was incredibly painful.
Years later, I developed bedsores on my wheelchair and felt all over the body ache. At that time, I constantly reminisced about the days when just a few years ago, I didn’t feel any pain, and could spend peaceful moments sitting in a wheelchair.
After even more years, I was diagnosed with uremia, and I had to go for dialysis. At this point, I would always yearn for the time when I only had bedsores on my wheelchair. If I couldn&amp;rsquo;t live to reach a state where every day was treated kindly, those next 50 years would have been wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifty-years-old-2&#34;&gt;Fifty Years Old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually feel that you shouldn’t wait until 50 to understand this principle; it should be understood in your 30s or 40s, because all things are easily missed if you wait. Like a meal during a trip – if you don&amp;rsquo;t eat it, you can still have it 30 years later, and it might not even taste the same. So I think treating every today is my first feeling at 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing is curiosity. I’ve realized that I can stop being curious about many things at any time because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so much and experienced so much, but I encourage myself to remain curious. Therefore, when doing a lot of things now, I approach them with a sense of curiosity – whether a phone can be held vertically to take pictures, it can; whether you can do live reporting, whether you can attend seemingly large and very formal events, can you make the connection easier? It’s more fun and more impressive for everyone. And how can you then use new media to spread the word? All of this is possible. I believe curiosity is the most important driving force for human progress, and why can’t it be the most important driver for individual advancement? A nation that loses its curiosity is doomed. On a broader level, 50 is a crucial test. When you&amp;rsquo;re in your fifties in China, what kind of entrenched interests do you hold? I’m very concerned that many people around me pursue countless dreams when they’re young because of their aspirations, but once they achieve those dreams and become entrenched beneficiaries, they transform into those who obstruct others from realizing their own. Am I right? Looking back, they treat young people and matters in the way they used to dislike most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifty-years-old-3&#34;&gt;Fifty Years Old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, a few years ago I started recruiting 11 graduate students each year as volunteers, and after spending two years with them, they have now all graduated. There are five graduating classes, totaling 55 pure graduate students who have already finished their studies. I think it’s a very happy thing to create such a system – you gain some experience, and you have the ability to guide them. After each day of class, I invite them for dinner, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost much. However, this is what a good vested interest should do – a vested interest can be two aspects: one is to become paving stones again. I once said that I don’t want to say thank you too much to those who have helped me, because I want to treat new young people ten times over. This is the way I express my gratitude.
&lt;strong&gt;If you constantly say “thank you” and become a blocker…&lt;/strong&gt; The next thing is to pave the road for others. I hope that, no matter whether it’s material, economic, ideological, or cultural – across all fields – when you become a vested interest group in China, you will consider how you should act. Yesterday’s pusher of the train has become today’s person blocking the train; looking back at Chinese history, this is everywhere. It won&amp;rsquo;t be like that; sometimes it even becomes more so. Therefore, I call on all vested interests to return to the way they were when they were young – to act as they wished to encounter such people. Even if I may not do well in that role, I at least want to think about it, do it, and speak about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Standard Library Container Memory Allocators: allocator</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/standard-library-container-memory-allocator/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2019 13:26:19 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/standard-library-container-memory-allocator/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A custom allocator can improve performance, increase memory utilization efficiency, and address the issue of frequent, small memory allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;antecedent&#34;&gt;Antecedent
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the development of network data packets, requiring frequent allocation and release of small blocks of memory. Initially, I considered using a memory pool, reviewing several existing ones and discovering this:
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/cacay/MemoryPool&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/cacay/MemoryPool&lt;/a&gt;
When looking at the interface, I was quite puzzled by how the memory pool&amp;rsquo;s implementation was a bit strange. The &lt;code&gt;MemoryPool&lt;/code&gt; implementation logic involves allocating fixed-size memory spaces. Having reviewed Boost’s memory pool interface, it provides a template that is instantiated when used. Fortunately, this library already had an article describing it, mentioning the concept of ‘allocator’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;#### [wiki](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E5%99%A8_(C%2B%2B))

In C++ programming, an allocator is a key component of the C++ standard library. The C++ library defines various data structures commonly referred to as &amp;quot;containers&amp;quot; (such as linked lists, sets, etc.). A common feature of these containers is that their size can be changed at runtime; therefore, dynamic memory allocation becomes necessary to achieve this. The allocator is used to handle container requests for memory allocation and deallocation. In other words, the allocator encapsulates the low-level details of memory management for standard template library (STL) containers. By default, the C++ standard library uses its built-in generic allocator; however, programmers can customize allocators to replace it as needed.
``` The allocator was originally invented by Alexander Stepanov as part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) as a way to “make the library more flexible and independent of the underlying data model,” allowing programmers to use custom pointer and reference types within the library. However, when the STL was incorporated into the C++ standard, the C++ standards committee realized that full abstraction of the data model would lead to unacceptable performance penalties. To compromise, restrictions on allocators in the standard became much stricter, and as a result, the degree to which allocators can be customized is now greatly limited compared to Stepanov’s original vision.

```markdown
#### [wiki](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E5%99%A8_(C%2B%2B))
Although customization of the allocator is limited, it is still often necessary to use a custom allocator in many cases, typically for encapsulating access methods to different types of memory spaces (such as shared memory and reclaimed memory), or for improving performance when using memory pools. In addition, from the perspective of memory usage and execution time, introducing a dedicated allocator for programs that frequently perform small amounts of memory allocation will also benefit.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;usage-requirementshttpszhwikipediaorgwikie58886e9858de599a8_c2b2b&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E5%99%A8_%28C%2B%2B%29&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Usage Requirements&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defining custom allocators primarily aims to improve performance. Utilizing a dedicated custom allocator can enhance program performance, or improve memory usage efficiency, or both [4][8]. The default allocator uses the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; operator to allocate storage [Reference 5], which often leverages the C language heap allocation function (malloc()) [9]. Because heap allocation functions are typically optimized for infrequent large memory allocations, the default allocator generally performs well when allocating memory for containers that require a single large memory allocation, such as vectors and doubly-ended queues [8]. However, when using the default allocator to allocate memory for associative containers with linked lists or bidirectional linked lists – which frequently require allocating small amounts of memory – performance is typically very low [4][9].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;usage-requirementshttpsenwikipediaorgwikimemory_pool_c2b2b&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_pool_%28C%2B%2B%29&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Usage Requirements&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, this section (…)(like) is a “I Have a Dream” speech for the allocator. Before the dream comes true, programmers concerned with portability will be limited to (using) stateless custom allocators.
—Scott Meyers, &lt;em&gt;Effective STL&lt;/em&gt;
Given this, in this case, memory pools are often used to address frequent, small allocations [8]. Unlike the default “on-demand allocation” method, when using a memory pool allocator, the program pre-allocates large blocks of memory (referred to as the “memory pool”) upfront.  Then, when requesting memory, the custom allocator simply returns a pointer to an available block within the pool. Unlike object deconstruction, no actual memory is released; instead, the release is deferred until the lifecycle of the memory pool ends [Note 1][8].&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Usage Requirements&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the topic of &amp;ldquo;Custom Allocators,&amp;rdquo; numerous C++ experts and authors have participated in discussions, such as Scott Meyers&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Effective STL&lt;/em&gt; and Andrei Alexandrescu’s &lt;em&gt;Modern C++ Design&lt;/em&gt;, which both mention it. Meyers observed that if one requires all instances of a particular type &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;’s allocator to be equal, then the portable allocator instance must not contain state. Although the C++ standard encourages library implementers to support stateful allocators [Ref 4], Meyers called this paragraph “(seemingly) a wonderful idea,” but it is almost empty rhetoric, and considered the allocator restrictions “too strict” [4]. For example, STL’s list allows the splice method, meaning a node from one list object A can be directly inserted into another list object B. This requires that the memory allocated by A’s allocator is released by B’s allocator, thereby deducing that A and B’s allocator instances must be equal. Meyer’s conclusion is that allocators should be defined as types using static methods. For example, according to the C++ standard, an allocator must provide a class template other that implements the rebind method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;usage-requirementshttpszhwikipediaorgwikie58886e9858de599a8_c2b2b-2&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E5%99%A8_%28C%2B%2B%29&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Usage Requirements&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in &lt;em&gt;The C++ Programming Language&lt;/em&gt; by Bjarne Stroustrup, he states “&amp;lsquo;strict allocation to avoid different information for each object,&amp;rsquo; this is clearly not a problem’ (roughly), and points out that most allocators don&amp;rsquo;t need state, or even perform better when there is no state. He proposes three use cases for custom allocators: pool-based allocator, shared memory allocator, and garbage collector, and demonstrates an implementation of an allocator which utilizes an internal memory pool to quickly allocate/deallocate small amounts of memory. However, he also notes that such optimization may already be present in the sample allocator he provides [3].
Another use for custom allocators is debugging memory-related errors [10]. To achieve this, you can write a memory allocator that allocates additional memory when allocating, and uses it to store debugging information. This allocator not only ensures that memory is allocated/deallocated by the same type of allocator, but also provides some protection against cache overflows [11].&lt;/p&gt;
