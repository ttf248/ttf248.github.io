        <title>GitHub Pages Easter Egg: Deploying Multiple Pages</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My sleep schedule has been messed up lately; I was still working on deploying my Github Pages at 2 AM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finishing my extra shift, I went to eat, and just after eating, I felt sleepy. I returned around 8:30, feeling drowsy, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d doze off for a bit, but ended up falling asleep directly. I woke up at over 2 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-lived category: AI Study Group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;expose-hypocrisy-debunking-prove-wrong&#34;&gt;Expose hypocrisy; debunking; prove wrong
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We said yesterday we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mess with the frontend, but today we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on the UI/UX experience instead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project&#34;&gt;Project
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d like to invite our old friend, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, it’s the original self-selected stock project. The entire project structure is being refactored, and all subsequent AI programming content will be placed under this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploy-multiple-pages&#34;&gt;Deploy multiple Pages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project is currently hosted domestically at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cnb.cool/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://cnb.cool/ttf248/ai-coding-demo&lt;/a&gt;. Due to well-known restrictions, publishing pages isn&amp;rsquo;t supported within China, so we need to publish it on a foreign GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog is published on GitHub. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried it, but it&amp;rsquo;s for publishing multiple projects as pages. Also, the current project isn&amp;rsquo;t a traditional blog site; it just contains lots of documentation and several static HTML designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.ttf248.life/p/github-pages-easter-egg-deploy-multiple-sites/20250528030230.png&#34;
	width=&#34;798&#34;
	height=&#34;530&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;pages&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;150&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;361px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, I discovered that deploying multiple projects as Pages doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect blog publishing; instead, it adds a new path under the blog&amp;rsquo;s domain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/ai-coding-demo/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://ttf248.life/ai-coding-demo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but exclaim &amp;ldquo;perfect!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-study-group&#34;&gt;AI Study Group
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I created a new category yesterday, thinking of using AI to learn many computer science courses, such as algorithms and LeetCode practice questions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each learning record will be published on my blog, forming a knowledge base. A new category has been created: AI Study Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each course, create a new project and document your learning notes in the project&amp;rsquo;s Readme.md file&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Old habits, dazzling flowers captivate the eyes</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/old-ailment-stunning-flowers/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having focused on backend development for many years, I recently started exploring &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;italicized and bolded&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; frontend interfaces to implement one, but in reality, these attempts haven&amp;rsquo;t been particularly helpful for my current work and have instead scattered my focus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;applicable-scenarios-for-ai&#34;&gt;Applicable scenarios for AI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI tools can be particularly effective in small projects, especially when writing functions that are independent, have low system coupling, and feature simple business logic. These tasks typically involve clear inputs and outputs with limited context dependencies, making them well-suited for current AI-assisted programming capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, AI&amp;rsquo;s limitations become apparent when dealing with complex system architectures or deep business logic. It may generate code that appears reasonable but is actually detached from the project’s actual needs, and even introduce potential issues difficult to debug. In these scenarios, AI is better suited as an assistive tool rather than a fully relied-upon code generator. We need to rigorously review and test the generated code to ensure it meets practical requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cost-of-mistakes-and-learning&#34;&gt;The Cost of Mistakes and Learning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While attempting to generate frontend code using AI, I encountered numerous challenges. As frontend isn&amp;rsquo;t my area of expertise, troubleshooting issues proved time-consuming and draining. Even with prompt adjustments for AI rewrites, low-level errors were difficult to avoid. This repeated trial and error not only wasted time but also highlighted that my efforts are better focused on the backend’s business logic rather than exploring unfamiliar territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the project completed this weekend, I&amp;rsquo;m even more convinced that focusing on backend development and user interaction logic, implementing functionality through the console, is currently the most efficient approach. Systematically learning frontend knowledge later, when I have more time and energy, might be a better strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;frontend-learning-plan&#34;&gt;Frontend learning plan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front-end tech stack is complex and diverse, making it unrealistic to quickly master. I plan to focus on one framework initially, such as Vue.js or React.js, and deeply learn its core concepts and usage. Only after gaining a solid understanding of the fundamentals should I attempt AI-assisted code generation for the front-end, to effectively avoid errors and wasted time due to unfamiliarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, the focus should remain on backend development and steadily building core skills. Explore the combination of frontend and AI when the time is right; that may yield greater rewards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Claude4 released, attempting development: Hugo tag, hyperlink translation assistant</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/claude-4-release-and-experimentation-hugo-tags-hyperlink-translation-assistant/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 03:05:31 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/claude-4-release-and-experimentation-hugo-tags-hyperlink-translation-assistant/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This site is built with Hugo, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Chinese titles, which results in unfriendly URLs. To put it simply, when shared, they don&amp;rsquo;t look good because Chinese characters are encoded as things like %E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD. While slugs can fix this, manually setting them each time is too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, today I tried using Claude4 to develop a translation assistant that automatically converts Chinese titles into English slugs and adds hyperlinks within articles. This would eliminate the need for manual setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude 4 is excellent; its ability to understand context and handle complex tasks has been significantly improved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-address&#34;&gt;Project address
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domestic project address: &lt;strong&gt;PROTECTED&lt;/strong&gt;
Overseas project address: &lt;strong&gt;PROTECTED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-implementation&#34;&gt;Code implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the translation: First, let me outline the approach: We need to scan all articles, extract tag information and article titles, then call a local large language model (like gemma-3-12b-it) for translation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical development, compared to previous generations of large models, it not only supports the statistics and analysis of tags but also includes classification statistics and can even detect &lt;strong&gt;unlabeled article previews&lt;/strong&gt; and generate tag pages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether connecting to local large models, adding translation caches, or conducting large-scale code refactoring, &lt;code&gt;Claude4&lt;/code&gt;Everything was completed in one go, with almost no issues. Although the project wasn&amp;rsquo;t large-scale, it included many small features. Previously, large language models often forgot earlier context during development, but this time&amp;hellip;&lt;code&gt;Claude4&lt;/code&gt; performs exceptionally well, &lt;strong&gt;rarely losing context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, with improved intelligence, we&amp;rsquo;re preparing to switch to &lt;strong&gt;PROTECTD_INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; for more development work as our primary coding model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;translation-cache&#34;&gt;Translation cache
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach, aside from reducing large model calls, offers good efficiency when running a 12b model locally without causing delays. However, repeatedly calling the large model can still be slow. Secondly, to maintain article links, full updates sometimes produce inconsistent results due to long titles, leading to link changes – which is quite awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;feature-optimization&#34;&gt;Feature optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire project was handed over to [REDACTED], who analyzed areas for optimization and provided the following suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;配置外置化 - 提高可维护性和灵活性
结构化日志 - 便于问题排查和监控
性能监控 - 了解系统运行状况
用户体验 - 进度条等视觉反馈
错误处理 - 更完善的异常处理机制
代码组织 - 更清晰的模块划分
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code review was completed and everything looks good. For example, the configuration file now automatically generates a default if one doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist when reading it, converting previous configurations to defaults – this prevents user errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requirements: While translating the main text, dynamically calculate the current translation efficiency, estimate the remaining time, and output relevant information to the console. This includes tracking the number of characters obtained from the article, the number of characters translated per line, the elapsed time, a fitted calculation for the translation time per 100 characters, and an estimated remaining translation time for the entire article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is done, but I&amp;rsquo;m not very satisfied with the results, so I asked AI to provide new design suggestions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides multiple efficiency calculation methods: real-time efficiency, average efficiency, sliding window efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved display methods: progress bar, segmented statistics, dynamic refresh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more useful metrics: API call count, success rate, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing the code, I discovered a new surprise – real-time statistics on translation efficiency are displayed without mindless scrolling&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The multifaceted impacts of the family planning policy: profound changes from social structure to economic politics</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/planned-parenthood-multidimensional-impact-social-structure-economic-political-transformation/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 02:36:49 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/planned-parenthood-multidimensional-impact-social-structure-economic-political-transformation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s family planning policy, while limiting population growth, curbed familial development, disrupted traditional social structures, and suppressed the expansion of family businesses and political dynasties. Compared to South Korea’s chaebols and India’s family monopolies, its uniqueness is evident. Now that birth restrictions have been lifted, despite challenges like low birth rates, new monopoly risks must be guarded against, requiring a balance across various stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-rise-and-fall-of-population-control-and-family-style-development&#34;&gt;The Rise and Fall of Population Control and Family-Style Development
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family planning policy, a fundamental national policy in China for nearly forty years, has yielded significant results. Data shows that between 1978 and 2007, the natural population growth rate decreased from 12‰ to 5.2‰, reducing births by over 400 million, and China&amp;rsquo;s share of the world population fell from 22.2% to 20.1%. This sharp decline in population growth has profoundly reshaped Chinese society’s family structure. For example, in family businesses, the number of children born to owners significantly decreased: birth rates of three or more children dropped from 40.63% before the policy to 18.46% afterward, while single-child births increased from 6.25% to 32.31%. This structural change has directly led to a substantial reduction in the pool of potential internal successors for family businesses, objectively inhibiting their ability to expand across generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing South Korea and India, the differences are striking. Although South Korea has not implemented strict family planning policies, its birth rate has been persistently low (0.7 in 2023). However, chaebols maintain a firm grip on the national economy through cross-shareholdings and inheritance tax avoidance. The combined revenue of the five largest chaebols accounts for over 50% of South Korea&amp;rsquo;s GDP, with Samsung alone contributing 20%. India presents a different picture: family businesses contribute 79% of economic output, and six conglomerates control key sectors like telecommunications and steel. Twenty top companies account for 80% of the profits earned by all enterprises nationwide. The core difference lies in China&amp;rsquo;s family planning policy, which restricts family size and weakens the human resource base for family business expansion from the outset. Due to different policy environments, South Korea and India have allowed family influence to continuously permeate the economic sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;restraining-monopolies-and-social-structure-transformation&#34;&gt;Restraining Monopolies and Social Structure Transformation
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the economic sphere is particularly evident in its suppression of monopolies. Reduced daughter numbers have prevented Chinese family businesses from forming chaebol-like groups, similar to those in South Korea. For example, Korean chaebols maintain control through &amp;ldquo;circular investment,&amp;rdquo; with families like Samsung holding only 2% of shares but controlling everything through a complex equity structure. In China, family businesses after the implementation of family planning often face the challenge of “succession,” leading them to introduce professional managers or implement diversified shareholding reforms. A study by The Paper found that the proportion of female successors in family businesses increased from 13.85% to 34.21% following family planning, with a significant increase in their educational attainment – the percentage with bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degrees or higher rising from 43.75% to 98.46%. While this transformation hasn’t completely eliminated family control, it has significantly reduced the possibility of monopolies dominated by single families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a societal level, the family planning policy accelerated the breakdown of the traditional family core model. Household size in China decreased from 4.41 people per household in 1982 to 2.62 in 2020, weakening the family&amp;rsquo;s functions in areas such as economics, education, and social support. In contrast, India maintains a household size of around 4 people, with the caste system deeply intertwined with familial power, resulting in limited social mobility. The shift towards smaller families in China has created space for individualistic development; by 2023, there were 240 million single adults, and the consumption market is seeing the rise of a &amp;ldquo;one-person economy,&amp;rdquo; further diluting the influence of family economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;decentralization-of-power-in-the-political-sphere&#34;&gt;Decentralization of power in the political sphere
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family planning policy has had a profound impact on the political landscape as well. Traditionally, familial influence permeated local politics through kinship and marriage ties. For example, in Xinyi County, Henan Province, 161 political families virtually controlled all government departments, with 20% of cadres at the deputy section level or above being &amp;ldquo;second-generation officials.&amp;rdquo; However, the implementation of the family planning policy reduced household size, limiting the expansion of familial networks. Research from Peking University shows that the number of children among officials decreased after the policy was implemented, leading to a significant decline in the complexity of political family networks. Furthermore, the policy promoted education (increasing average years of schooling from 5.2 in 1982 to 10.9 in 2023), fostering social mobility and weakening the monopoly of familial influence on political resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing South Korea and India, the deep entanglement of Korean chaebols with politics (such as financial transactions between Samsung executives and the government) and the hereditary family politics under India&amp;rsquo;s caste system highlight the uniqueness of Chinese policy. China’s birth planning policies have objectively reduced the possibility of power inheritance. While familial phenomena still exist in county-level politics, the overall trend is a dispersal of power structures. During the 2025 National People&amp;rsquo;s Congress, a CPPCC member proposed renaming the &amp;ldquo;Law on Population and Birth Planning&amp;rdquo; to the &amp;ldquo;Population and Fertility Law,&amp;rdquo; fully relaxing birth restrictions – a move that could further influence the evolution of future political ecology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;challenges-and-opportunities-after-policy-adjustments&#34;&gt;Challenges and Opportunities After Policy Adjustments
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the two-child policy in 2016 and the three-child policy in 2021 marked a significant shift in China’s birth policies. However, the effects have been limited: the birth rate in 2022 was only 1.18, far below the replacement level (2.1). Relaxing birth restrictions has a dual impact on family businesses: some entrepreneurs may strengthen their ability to pass down their legacy through having more children, as exemplified by Zong Fuli of Wahaha Group succeeding her father; conversely, high childcare costs (averaging 1 million yuan to raise a child to 18 in first-tier cities) and declining willingness among working women to have children are restricting family expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Releasing restrictions on childbirth could spur new monopolies in the economic sphere. The three-child policy is driving consolidation within industries like maternal and infant care, with the early childhood education market projected to reach 162.13 billion yuan by 2025. Leading companies are integrating smaller firms through mergers and acquisitions, resulting in a CR5 concentration exceeding 55%. While this consolidation may increase efficiency, it also poses monopolistic risks. The government must balance encouraging childbirth with preventing excessive market concentration – for example, strengthening antitrust regulation while providing childcare subsidies (such as the 3000 yuan monthly milk powder subsidy for families with three children in Hangzhou) to alleviate household burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easing birth restrictions may subtly impact family influence in the political sphere. While restoring traditional networks of familial politics is difficult in the short term, a rise in larger families could create new grassroots political influence over time. Therefore, refining cadre selection mechanisms and strengthening oversight (such as establishing rules to prevent relatives from holding positions) remain key to preventing power inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;international-lessons-and-future-prospects&#34;&gt;International Lessons and Future Prospects
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiences of South Korea and India demonstrate a close relationship between the rise and fall of family power and policy direction. South Korea achieved economic takeoff by supporting conglomerates (chaebols) but at the cost of social equity. India&amp;rsquo;s lack of effective policies to curb family monopolies has exacerbated wealth inequality. China’s birth planning policy, while controlling population growth, objectively suppressed the expansion of family influence, but also brought about issues like accelerated aging and labor shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, China needs to seek a new balance between population policy and socioeconomic development. This involves increasing birth rates through supportive policies (such as extended maternity leave and universal childcare facilities), while strengthening antitrust enforcement to prevent family businesses from forming new monopolies through financial operations. In the political sphere, further progress is needed in grassroots democracy construction, improving oversight mechanisms, and ensuring transparent governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the family planning policy, as a significant driver of social change in China, has had an impact far beyond the population sphere. It reshaped family structures, economic models, and the political landscape, providing a path for China to avoid falling into a Korean-Indian style trap of familial monopolies. As policies adjust, balancing efficiency with fairness, freedom with order within this new demographic context will be a long-term challenge for China.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the establishment of &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;, there&amp;rsquo;s been a surge in recording and publishing trivial things using AI. Consequently, time for quiet reflection has diminished. It would be better to slightly control the output of this column and consolidate it into a monthly publication, releasing one article per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like a lingering effect or side effect – efficiency increases, but depth and breadth of thought decrease&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;efficiency-improvement-undeniable&#34;&gt;Efficiency improvement: Undeniable
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, this column wasn&amp;rsquo;t well-maintained. Due to laziness, I didn’t search for information or compile records on some trending events. Now, with various AI tools, outlining is sufficient; the AI can automatically search and record related events, generate articles, and after simple formatting, they can be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is like a dream come true for those who don&amp;rsquo;t want to put in too much effort; it significantly boosts efficiency, almost achieving results with half the work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficiency significantly improves when coding instead of writing articles. Many code sections previously required detailed review of API documentation; now, this step can be skipped – a necessary shortcut. Familiarity with APIs is best left to AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;junk-content&#34;&gt;Junk content
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the submissions lack substance; they feel lifeless and stale, like chewing wax—not a style I previously enjoyed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, AI-generated content often feels like mass-produced work, lacking soul&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet junk of the new era&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forgetfulness&#34;&gt;Forgetfulness
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of article is AI-generated. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the readers, and over time, my own memory will fade or even disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar issues arise when coding – without reviewing the commit history, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to know your original thought process or rationale for a particular implementation. This is especially true with code generated after extensive revisions and discussions with AI, which can significantly diverge from the initial idea, even becoming entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;search&#34;&gt;Search
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a significant decrease in how often I use Google and Baidu recently; searching with AI is much better than traditional search engines, both in terms of interaction and results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s commemorate &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the earliest AI tools connected to the internet released by a major company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are using Google less; visits to &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; have decreased as well. Many questions can now be answered directly by AI, and this website is gradually being phased out by the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog I&amp;rsquo;m still maintaining doesn&amp;rsquo;t get much traffic anyway, and certainly won&amp;rsquo;t now; it’s more of a personal journal for my own reference&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Trade war put on hold</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2025 trade war tariff evolution showed a cycle of &amp;ldquo;escalation — retaliation — consultation,&amp;rdquo; shifting the US-China competition from tariff confrontation to rules-based competition. While short-term easing alleviated market pressure, long-term uncertainty remains; monitor the WTO rulings, supply chain adjustments, and geopolitical changes&amp;rsquo; continued impact on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People cannot earn money beyond their understanding. The stock market crash triggered by the trade war this year, even with a partial recovery now, has claimed countless retail investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timeline of Trade War Tariffs in 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of the 2025 trade war tariff timeline, incorporating key events from China, the US, and other countries to illustrate the evolution of tariff policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-april-2025-comprehensive-tariff-escalation-and-retaliation&#34;&gt;I. April 2025: Comprehensive Tariff Escalation and Retaliation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration signed order 14257, announcing a 34% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the US, covering products from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The U.S. is further raising tariffs on China from 34% to 84%, and has signed Executive Orders 14259 and 14266, imposing additional tariffs on more goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The White House revised an executive order, raising the total tariffs on China to 145%, and increasing duties on small parcels (e.g., raising the tariff rate on goods under $800 from 90% to 120%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China announced a 34% tariff on all goods originating from the United States, covering sectors like agriculture, automobiles, and energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China will retaliate by raising tariffs from 34% to 84%, matching the US escalation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China is removing 91% of tariffs on US goods (corresponding to the portion agreed upon by the US) and suspending the implementation of 90% of the remaining 24% tariffs, while retaining 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum products, prompting Canada to retaliate with tariffs on $2.98 billion worth of US goods and file a complaint with the WTO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The EU is imposing tariffs of up to 25% on US goods, while Japan expressed concerns over tariffs on US cars, calling the trade war &amp;ldquo;lose-lose.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;may-2025-geneva-talks-and-tariff-easing&#34;&gt;May 2025: Geneva Talks and Tariff Easing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China and the United States held 16 hours of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, resulting in the China-U.S. Geneva Trade Talks Joint Statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both sides announce suspension of some tariffs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US has suspended 24% of tariffs on China (for 90 days), retained 10%, and canceled additional duties scheduled for April 8th and 9th&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China will suspend 24% of retaliatory tariffs, retain 10%, and remove non-tariff measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both sides agreed to hold regular economic and trade consultations in China, the United States, or a third country, focusing on tariff reductions and rule-making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High tariffs are causing small and medium-sized enterprises to fail (e.g., Amazon sellers forced to close due to surging tariffs), and inflation expectations are rising (core PCE is projected to rise to 3.3%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China has tightened controls on rare earth exports, cracked down on smuggling, and impacted US military and new energy industries, forcing them to seek waivers for tariffs on key minerals like rare earths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-other-key-events-and-long-term-impacts&#34;&gt;III. Other Key Events and Long-Term Impacts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canada and China have both filed disputes with the WTO against the US steel and aluminum tariffs and &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; alleging violations of the non-discrimination principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned that U.S. tariffs could cause a 1% decline in global trade volume by 2025, exacerbating the difficulties faced by developing countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 37-page list covers strategic materials such as rare earths, graphite, and medical CT tubes, exposing supply chain vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US imposed a 25% tariff on imported cars, leading to a projected 2% drop in global auto production and a 9% reduction in North America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration attempted to reshape the international trade order through &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; but was criticized as unilateral bullying, prompting a backlash from allies (such as the EU and Japan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China is responding to protectionism by expanding market access (such as through import fairs and zero-tariff commitments) to attract cooperation from developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;timeline-summary&#34;&gt;Timeline Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The US is imposing 34% retaliatory tariffs on China, covering goods from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The US will raise tariffs on China to 84% and introduce new tax orders&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;China retaliates with tariffs, initially 34%, later raised to 84%; US modifies tariffs to 145%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The US waived tariffs on some goods (like tech products), and China canceled 91% of its retaliatory tariffs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;China, US, and Japan Geneva talks result in a joint statement agreeing to suspend 24% tariffs (for 90 days)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Both sides announced suspension of tariffs and a consultation mechanism, easing trade tensions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trends-and-challenges&#34;&gt;Trends and Challenges
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tariff suspension between China and the US sends a positive signal, but structural issues (such as high technology and energy) remain, and midterm elections may affect policy continuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies are accelerating supply chain adjustments; Mexico and Southeast Asia benefit from &amp;ldquo;nearshoring,&amp;rdquo; but rising costs may curb recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is limited, and regional trade agreements (such as the US-UK agreement) have become alternative options, but this exacerbates fragmentation&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Jiangxi Provinces Special Post &amp; National Civil Servant Teacher Recruitment Data (2020-2025): Trends and Insights</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Jiangxi Province&amp;rsquo;s teacher recruitment from 2020-2025 shows a significant reduction trend: Special post teacher hiring decreased sharply from 6,617 to 32 (a 99.5% decrease), and national cadre teachers dropped from 11,324 to 2,146 (an 81.1% decrease). While the proportion of core subjects (language, math, English) remained stable, the overall volume contracted. Though the proportion of arts, music, and physical education increased, absolute numbers were limited (e.g., only 2 recruits in 2025 for each subject). Policy shifts towards &amp;ldquo;one-in, one-out&amp;rdquo; staffing restrictions, with teacher resources directed toward vocational education and remote areas, have led to a substantial reduction in traditional primary and secondary school positions; some subjects had zero planned hires in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;学科分类&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specialty teachers focusing on compulsory education subjects in rural areas will be limited to a small number of core subject positions in 2025&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National curriculum teachers cover all grade levels, with a more comprehensive range of subjects, including early childhood education and special education (not listed separately due to data limitations)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of specialized teaching positions decreased by 99.5% in 2025 compared to 2020, and national civil servant teachers decreased by 81.1%, reflecting demographic shifts and adjustments to educational resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;学科冷热&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, Math, English) remains stable, but hiring volume is decreasing year by year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of subjects like arts, physical education, and music is increasing, but the absolute numbers remain limited (e.g., only 2 students admitted for each of arts, physical education, and music in 2025)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some subjects (such as English) have stopped admitting new students due to decreased enrollment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Merge Pull Request into forked repository</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/merge-pullrequest-to-fork-repository/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 18:44:03 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/merge-pullrequest-to-fork-repository/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; is a GitHub profile statistics generator that allows users to display various statistics and charts on their GitHub profiles. It offers multiple customization options to suit user needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I manage my warehouse by project groups. GitHub doesn&amp;rsquo;t support grouped repositories, so I had to use separate organizations. The latest branch couldn’t handle cross-organization repository statistics, so I forked a branch and merged the corresponding code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-effect&#34;&gt;Final effect
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github-readme-stats-chi-one-17.vercel.app/api?username=ttf248&amp;amp;hide_title=true&amp;amp;show_icons=true&amp;amp;hide=contribs&amp;amp;line_height=24&amp;amp;include_all_commits=true&amp;amp;count_private=true&amp;amp;bg_color=0000&amp;amp;text_color=8A919F&amp;amp;locale=cn&amp;amp;role=OWNER,COLLABORATOR,ORGANIZATION_MEMBER&amp;amp;timstamp=1746608356&#34;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/pull/2459&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Adds the ability to include data from organization repositories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;merge-pull-request-into-forked-repository&#34;&gt;Merge Pull Request into forked repository
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to merge a [BLANK_0] into your [BLANK_1], depending on what you want to achieve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge the PR from &lt;strong&gt;上游（upstream）仓库&lt;/strong&gt; into your fork, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge a PR from another person&amp;rsquo;s fork into your own fork, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge a pull request opened on your fork (e.g., someone created a PR from their fork of yours)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the translation: I’ll give you a very common scenario: &lt;strong&gt;你 fork 了一个仓库，想把上游的某个 PR 合并到你的 fork&lt;/strong&gt;. The operating procedure is as follows 👇:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;method-1-command-line-method-most-universal&#34;&gt;Method 1: Command-line method (most universal)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-1-clone-your-own-fork&#34;&gt;Step 1: Clone your own fork
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git clone https://github.com/你的用户名/仓库名.git
cd 仓库名
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-2-add-upstream-original-repository-address&#34;&gt;Step 2: Add upstream (original repository address)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git remote add upstream https://github.com/原作者用户名/仓库名.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-3-fetch-the-upstream-pr-branch&#34;&gt;Step 3: Fetch the upstream PR branch
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the PR number you want to merge, for example, PR #123&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pull the code for this PR like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git fetch upstream pull/123/head:pr-123
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-4-switch-and-merge-branches&#34;&gt;Step 4: Switch and merge branches
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git checkout main    # 或者你自己的目标分支
git merge pr-123
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything is normal, you can push to your forked GitHub repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git push origin main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;method-two-github-web-interface-simple-but-limited&#34;&gt;Method Two: GitHub Web Interface (Simple but Limited)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see a pull request on GitHub that is against an upstream repository, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to that PR page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Files changed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; in the upper right corner to see which branch this PR is based on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On your forked repository, create a new branch and manually cherry-pick the PR&amp;rsquo;s commits (requires some Git knowledge)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or click &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Open in GitHub Desktop&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; to merge using a GUI tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;if-someone-has-submitted-a-pull-request-for-your-fork&#34;&gt;If someone has submitted a pull request for your fork
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply go to the PR page and click the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Merge pull request&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; button&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like me to walk you through it step-by-step, based on your current situation (e.g., a PR link, whether you&amp;rsquo;re using the web interface or command line)? Or, you can provide a specific link, and I’ll help you analyze the simplest approach&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Commit messages in Git history</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/git-modify-commit-message/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 18:38:31 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/git-modify-commit-message/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This script is used to batch modify author information in Git history, rewriting commit records using &lt;code&gt;git filter-branch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provided script for batch modifying author information in Git repository history is conceptually correct, but (does not support array syntax)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve compatibility, it is recommended to replace the array with a space-separated string and iterate through each old email address using &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of the modified script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;#!/bin/sh

git filter-branch --env-filter &#39;
OLD_EMAILS=&amp;quot;TianlongXiang51@gmail.com nick@qq.com tianlongxiang51@gmail.com&amp;quot;
CORRECT_NAME=&amp;quot;tianlong.xiang&amp;quot;
CORRECT_EMAIL=&amp;quot;tianlong.xiang@foxmail.com&amp;quot;

for OLD_EMAIL in $OLD_EMAILS
do
    if [ &amp;quot;$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;$OLD_EMAIL&amp;quot; ]
    then
        export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_NAME&amp;quot;
        export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_EMAIL&amp;quot;
    fi
    if [ &amp;quot;$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;$OLD_EMAIL&amp;quot; ]
    then
        export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_NAME&amp;quot;
        export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=&amp;quot;$CORRECT_EMAIL&amp;quot;
    fi
done
&#39; --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before running this script, it is recommended to back up your repository to prevent unexpected issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This operation will rewrite Git history, modify commit author information, and may cause changes to commit hashes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have already pushed changes to the remote repository, you need to use a force push&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;git push --force --tags origin &#39;refs/heads/*&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use force pushes cautiously, especially in collaborative projects, to avoid impacting others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List all unique author email addresses in the warehouse statistics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git log --format=&#39;%an &amp;lt;%ae&amp;gt;&#39; | sort -u
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>The Celestial Realm of Medical Education and the Butterfly Effect of the Dong Xi-ying Incident</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-sky-dong-xiying-butterfly-effect/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 01:08:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-sky-dong-xiying-butterfly-effect/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Peking Union Medical Center &amp;ldquo;4+4&amp;rdquo; program (4 years of non-medical undergraduate + 4 years of medical PhD), emphasizing interdisciplinary elite training, was exposed in 2025 due to the Dong Xiying incident. Her entry into the program allegedly leveraged family background (a lineage of medical professionals/researchers), raising questions about her educational qualifications and allegations of plagiarism. This highlights a conflict between the program&amp;rsquo;s elitist admissions practices and fairness, alongside unresolved issues regarding shortened training periods and supervised practice concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt&#34;&gt;Prompt
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog post: The origins and development of Concordia 4+4. Key points: A corner of Heaven, seen by mortals; Miss Dong&amp;rsquo;s family background; it’s impossible for a normal medical PhD to graduate in eight years; Miss Dong&amp;rsquo;s family and educational backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disintegrated-palace-of-medical-education-unionmed-44&#34;&gt;The Disintegrated &amp;ldquo;Palace&amp;rdquo; of Medical Education: UnionMed 4+4
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;4+4&amp;rdquo; program at Peking Union Medical College, launched in 2018, has been regarded as a “heavenly palace” for medical education in China. Designed to emulate the American medical education system and guided by the principles of attracting individuals with diverse backgrounds, cultivating those with a passion for medicine, and recruiting talent from across the globe, it seeks to break new ground within the traditional medical education framework. Its core logic lies in &lt;strong&gt;用4年非医学本科教育+4年医学博士培养，替代传统的5+3+3（本科5年+硕士3年+博士3年）模式&lt;/strong&gt;, aiming to cultivate leading medical professionals with interdisciplinary expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Celestial Palace&amp;rdquo; attribute is reflected in three dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially, applicants were required to have graduated from universities ranked within the top 50 by QS/Times/US News or among the top 10 US News liberal arts colleges (such as Barnard College). While later relaxed to include schools ranked in the top 100, a GPA of 3.6 or higher, or being in the top 30% of their class is still required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilizing an American organ-system integrated curriculum and PBL (Problem-Based Learning) teaching methods, students must complete core courses such as anatomy and pathology within four years, alongside clinical internships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the passing rate for the licensing exam (95.2%) was slightly lower than the traditional eight-year program (98.5%), graduates largely enter Peking Union Medical Center affiliated hospitals, and their career development shows no significant difference from the traditional path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dong-xi-ying-incident-cracks-in-heavenly-palace-seen-by-a-mortal&#34;&gt;The Dong Xi-ying Incident: Cracks in &amp;ldquo;Heavenly Palace&amp;rdquo; Seen by a Mortal
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, a report of extramarital affairs involving Dr. Xiao Fei, a thoracic surgeon at the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital, unexpectedly exposed the &amp;ldquo;mystery&amp;rdquo; surrounding Peking Union Medical Center&amp;rsquo;s 4+4 project. The resume of the involved party, Dong Xiuying, raised three points of concern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;学历背景的模糊性&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Xiyi claims to have graduated from Columbia University, but in fact attended its affiliated Barnard College (ranked 14th by US News for liberal arts colleges in 2025). Although Barnard meets the &amp;ldquo;top 20 liberal arts college&amp;rdquo; requirement, its diploma simultaneously lists “Barnard College” and “Columbia University,” which can easily be mistaken for Columbia’s main campus in the domestic recruitment market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The path of a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in economics followed by a doctorate in clinical medicine, while meeting the &amp;ldquo;multidisciplinary background&amp;rdquo; requirement of the 4+4 program, has been questioned for lacking a foundation in pre-medical coursework. Furthermore, his doctoral dissertation, &amp;ldquo;Research on Multi-Modal Image Fusion Technology in Medical Image Analysis,&amp;rdquo; has been accused of significant similarity to a Beijing University of Science and Technology invention patent, raising concerns of academic misconduct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;家庭背景的特殊性&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His father is a secretary at China Metallurgical Research Institute, his mother is an associate dean at the Beihang University Engineering Technology Research Institute, his grandfather is an academician in the field of imaging at Peking Union Medical College, his maternal grandparents are foreign academicians in materials science, and his aunts and uncles are professors at Beihang University. This &amp;ldquo;medicine + research + university&amp;rdquo; family background provides him with hidden resources such as letters of recommendation (requiring two biomedical associate professors) and research collaborations (such as patents from Beihang University).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During residency, he switched from thoracic surgery to urology, with research spanning multiple fields including orthopedics, gastroenterology, and imaging, leading to accusations of &amp;ldquo;paving the way with resources.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;学制争议的放大&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional medicine doctoral programs require 11 years (5+3+3), while the 4+4 program compresses this to 8 years. Despite Peking Union Medical College&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on &amp;ldquo;integrated curriculum&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;early clinical exposure,&amp;rdquo; some doctors note that its clinical internship time (12 months) is less than the traditional eight-year system (18 months), potentially impacting skill development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some training bases allow a one-year reduction in required training for 4+4 graduates, raising concerns about fairness within the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dilemma-of-medical-education-behind-the-controversy&#34;&gt;The Dilemma of Medical Education Behind the Controversy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dong Xi-ying case reflects the deep-rooted contradictions in China&amp;rsquo;s medical education system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;精英化与公平性的冲突&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;application-review system&amp;rdquo; of the 4+4 program is essentially a transplant of the American medical school model, but China lacks standardized exams like the MCAT, and subjective evaluations such as letters of recommendation and research experience are easily influenced by family background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data shows that among the 2023 graduates (4+4 program), 30% came from Tsinghua, Peking University, and Fudan University, 25% from overseas prestigious universities, indicating a significant influence of family background on applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;学制改革的现实困境&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research output (e.g., publications) from 4+4 medical students is significantly lower than that of traditional eight-year programs, leading to criticism of prioritizing clinical experience over research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-tier hospitals prioritize the Peking Union Medical Center brand, while community hospitals are cautious about the clinical abilities of 4+4 program graduates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;医学教育的国际接轨之惑&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US 4+4 model requires passing the MCAT and completing 3-7 years of residency, while China&amp;rsquo;s 4+4 program simplifies admission and residency, resulting in a superficial resemblance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to data from the Ministry of Education, in 2024 nationwide medical doctoral program admissions, programs following the 4+4 model accounted for less than 5%, and their widespread promotion still faces challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reconstructing-the-celestial-palace-order-of-medical-education&#34;&gt;Reconstructing the &amp;ldquo;Celestial Palace&amp;rdquo; Order of Medical Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding the Union 4+4 project is fundamentally a clash between elite education and public expectations. When a corner of &amp;ldquo;heavenly palace&amp;rdquo; (referring to top-tier medical training) is glimpsed by ordinary people, it exposes not only flaws in individual cases but also deep-seated contradictions within the entire medical education system. Future reforms need to focus on three levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce standardized exams (like China&amp;rsquo;s version of the MCAT) to reduce the influence of subjective factors such as letters of recommendation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restore the internship period for 4+4 graduates to 3 years to ensure clinical competency standards are met&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish an academic integrity review mechanism, with rigorous originality verification for interdisciplinary research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical education should not be a privilege for a few, but a true incubator for medical excellence. Only when fairness in selection, rigor in training, and standardization of career development are comprehensively ensured can this &amp;ldquo;medical education experiment&amp;rdquo; truly take root.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Tariff storm, stock market crash</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/tariffs-storm-stock-market-crash/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 03:49:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/tariffs-storm-stock-market-crash/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, global stock markets have experienced sharp volatility, largely due to new comprehensive tariff measures announced by U.S. President Donald Trump, sparking market concerns about a global trade war and economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump announced tariffs on all imported goods last week, with up to a 50% tariff on imports from China, aiming to correct what he called an unfair global trade system. This move triggered panic selling in global markets as investors worried that escalating trade tensions would stifle global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, major stock indexes suffered significant losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,200 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;amp;P 500 indices dropped 4% and 3.8%, respectively, entering bear market territory. Asian and European markets were also affected, with the Nikkei 225 in Japan falling nearly 8% and European stock markets declining by 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with market volatility, investors are shifting to safe-haven assets like bonds and the yen. However, a surge in the VIX to above 60 indicates escalating market panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists warn that tariff policies could lead to &amp;ldquo;stagflation&amp;rdquo; in the U.S. economy – a situation of stagnant growth, rising inflation, and high unemployment occurring simultaneously. JPMorgan Chase has raised the probability of a U.S. recession in 2025 to 60%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments worldwide have announced retaliatory measures. For example, the EU trade commissioner stated that they will begin imposing retaliatory tariffs on US goods on April 15th. Businesses have also expressed concerns; Goldman Sachs, for instance, has raised the probability of a US economic recession to 45%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, global markets are facing unprecedented challenges; investors need to closely monitor trade policy developments and market changes, while managing risk and allocating assets&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Feeling bored, wanting to design a Chinese ink-wash style theme</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-ink-style-theme/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 03:42:47 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-ink-style-theme/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m tired of colorful, flashy homepages; I suddenly want to go for a minimalist style and design a Chinese ink-wash theme&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stylesheets have been heavily modified, with specific styles configured for different elements to override the theme&amp;rsquo;s default styling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without refactoring, attempting to directly generate a new theme using AI results in very unstable outcomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, I also encountered a queue for the Trae Claude large language model. Switching to VS Code agent mode resulted in very poor performance; the modifications lacked any design sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s because I don&amp;rsquo;t understand frontend well enough to effectively break down tasks for AI&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Broad-based index investing: Broker ETFs, Hang Seng Tech Index</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/etf-wide-index-dzt-broker-etfs-hangsheng-tech-index/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 21:58:59 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to buy a solid blue-chip stock and just leave it, but I never managed to do it. When it fell, I didn&amp;rsquo;t add to my position, and when it rose, I sold it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding suitable blue-chip stocks is troublesome; it&amp;rsquo;s better to choose a broad index and buy an ETF. The current plan is: securities ETF, Hang Seng Tech Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trading strategy has a professional term: left-side dip buying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;broker-etfs&#34;&gt;Broker ETFs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securities ETF refers to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that primarily invest in listed securities broker stocks within the Chinese stock market. Securities ETFs typically track a specific securities brokerage index, such as the China Securities Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought it before, but chased after the price and ended up losing money, so I cleared out my position. In China&amp;rsquo;s market, every bull market sees brokerages rise; how much they rise depends on investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-technology-index&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Technology Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index is a stock index launched by the Hong Kong Exchange, designed to reflect the overall performance of the technology sector in the Hong Kong market. It includes major tech companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, covering areas such as internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 20, 2025, the top ten constituents and their weightings in the Hang Seng Tech Index (code: 800700) are as follows (data compiled from multiple authoritative sources):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;舜宇集团 (舜宇光学科技集团有限公司) (01810.HK): Approximately 8.82%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China Resources Pharmaceutical Holdings (00700.HK): Approximately 8.14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Country Garden (09988.HK): Approximately 7.72%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;京东集团-SW&lt;/strong&gt; (09618.HK): Approximately 7.60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;舜宇光学科技集团有限公司 (Sunvision Technology Co., Ltd.) (03690.HK): Approximately 7.35%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(01024.HK): Approximately 6.10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bold (02015.HK): Approximately 6.09%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;中芯国际&lt;/strong&gt; (00981.HK): Approximately 5.70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(09999.HK): Approximately 4.59%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approximately 4.48%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 66.6% (some sources indicate a combined share of the top ten between 68%-69%, with differences due to varying statistical time points)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-notes&#34;&gt;Key Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index caps the weighting of any single stock at 8%. For example, SMIC&amp;rsquo;s weighting previously exceeded 8% before adjustments in March 2025 but was subsequently reduced to comply with this limit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On May 16, 2025, Hang Seng Index Company announced that BYD (01211.HK) will be added to the index and China Literature (00772.HK) removed. The adjustment will take effect on June 6. Therefore, as of today (May 20), the constituent stocks are based on the pre-adjustment list; BYD is not yet included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The top ten components are dominated by internet technology companies (such as Tencent, Alibaba, and Meituan), with significant weighting in new energy vehicles (Xiaomi, Li Auto) and semiconductors (SMIC), reflecting the index&amp;rsquo;s coverage of technology and the new economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differences in data from various sources are primarily due to differing statistical time points. For example, data from March 2025 shows the top ten combined share at approximately 69.4%, while data from May 14th indicates 68.82%, reflecting the dynamic impact of market fluctuations on weighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-to-position-on-a-pullback-on-the-left-side&#34;&gt;Add to position on a pullback (on the left side)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;left-side topping up&amp;rdquo; strategy is an investment approach where investors buy in batches during a sustained stock price decline, anticipating the price is nearing a bottom to reduce holding costs and profit from future price increases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method falls under the category of &amp;ldquo;left-side trading,&amp;rdquo; meaning taking a counter-trend position before the market has clearly bottomed out. In practice, investors typically employ a &amp;ldquo;pyramid&amp;rdquo; accumulation strategy, gradually increasing buy quantities as the price declines to lower their average holding cost. For example, initially buying a certain number of shares; if the price continues to fall, they increase their buying volume at a lower price, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying in batches during a downturn can lower average cost basis and set the stage for future profits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing positions before the market reverses can yield greater returns when the trend improves if your judgment is correct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the stock price continues to fall, it may lead to greater losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adequate financial support is required for continuous restocking, and there&amp;rsquo;s a risk of funds being locked up long-term&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively speaking, &amp;ldquo;right-side trading&amp;rdquo; involves buying after a clear market trend and price recovery signal, offering lower risk but potentially missing early gains. Therefore, investors should choose a strategy that aligns with their risk tolerance, financial situation, and market judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory&#34;&gt;Valuation theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuation theory is a core concept in finance, aiming to assess the intrinsic value of assets or companies and provide a basis for investment decisions. Through valuation, investors can determine whether the current market price of an asset is reasonable and formulate corresponding investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is based on the expected future cash flows of an asset, which are then discounted to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The DCF method emphasizes intrinsic value and is suitable for evaluating companies with stable and predictable earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method assesses a company&amp;rsquo;s relative value by comparing its valuation metrics (e.g., P/E, P/B, P/S) to those of comparable companies in the same industry. Relative valuation is easy to implement and widely used for quick assessments and peer comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method determines a company&amp;rsquo;s value by assessing its net asset value, which is the difference between total assets and liabilities. The asset-based approach is suitable for asset-dominant companies such as real estate firms or capital-intensive businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through valuation, investors can identify undervalued or overvalued assets and formulate buy-or-sell strategies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In M&amp;amp;A transactions, valuation is key to determining the transaction price and influencing its success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company needs to fairly value its assets and liabilities to ensure the accuracy and transparency of financial statements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that valuation results are influenced by various factors, including market conditions, company operations, and macroeconomic indicators. Therefore, a comprehensive consideration of all factors, combined with qualitative and quantitative analysis, is necessary to achieve more accurate assessments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Design and develop a customizable stock selection module (without coding)</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/no-code-design-develop-custom-stock-module/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:20:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/no-code-design-develop-custom-stock-module/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We tested Cursor last month, but due to free tier limitations, we didn&amp;rsquo;t develop complex features, just simple testing. We noticed that ByteDance also released a similar product at the time, both using the same underlying large language model: Claude-3.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ByteDance&amp;rsquo;s product, Trae, initially launched a Mac version and finally released a Windows version this February. Big company products are just good – you can use them for free without paying, with unlimited access to Claude-3.5, which is a very impressive model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, development stalled on the K-line chart due to my limited knowledge of React. To continue, I need to supplement my frontend skills and break down tasks into smaller steps instead of tackling a large project like developing a K-line chart directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;issues-found&#34;&gt;Issues found
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to insufficient training data for Vue3 + Element-Plus due to reliance on foreign AI models, we chose React as the frontend framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There may be occasional grammatical errors that require manual correction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some complex problems require human guidance for solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code structure optimization requires human guidance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most time-consuming part was packaging the frontend code into a container. As someone with zero experience, I had no understanding of this process; I only managed to grasp the logic with help from others. There&amp;rsquo;s a significant difference in how frontend development checks code between dev and build modes. The database and service containers for the backend took about five minutes combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;warehouse-address&#34;&gt;Warehouse address
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests, we&amp;rsquo;re skipping the coding and directly discussing with AI to design and develop a custom stock selection module. Let’s see what kind of results we can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warehouse address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/ttf248/trae-demo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/ttf248/trae-demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed usage instructions can be found in the repository&amp;rsquo;s README.md file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository contains numerous submission records, mostly conversations between me and Trae, along with my tests of various features for him. Notes indicate whether manual intervention was required to implement the corresponding functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt&#34;&gt;Prompt
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project was created from scratch. Here&amp;rsquo;s the prompt for the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;基于项目原型图，开发功能：自选股，需要支持合约的新增、删除、修改、查询。自选股界面需要展示基础的行情数据。支持多个不同的市场切换。

前端：react
后端：golang gin gorm
数据库：PostgreSQL

服务端需要支持跨域请求，同时需要考虑数据的校验和错误处理，如果后端服务不可用，前端需要告警提示。

后端需要展示请求和应答的日志；前端也打印通讯的日志，方便排查问题。
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ui-and-interaction-optimization&#34;&gt;UI and interaction optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frontend design is entirely dependent on Grok. We initially created a prototype within Trae, but it lacked aesthetic appeal. Due to the model&amp;rsquo;s strong coding capabilities and weaker overall abilities, we need to use Grok to optimize the frontend UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking screenshots of the current interface, uploading them to Grok, and having it help us optimize the UI, we can potentially receive numerous optimization suggestions. We will then manually evaluate these suggestions and copy them into Trae for execution, observing the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;technology-stack&#34;&gt;Technology stack
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frontend: React + TypeScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backend: Golang + Gin + GORM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database: PostgreSQL 17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;system-architecture&#34;&gt;System architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;backend-architecture&#34;&gt;Backend architecture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backend is implemented using Go&amp;rsquo;s Gin framework for a RESTful API, with modules including:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Two years of AI development: Its somewhat like the state before Docker was released</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-docker-pre-release/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:16:37 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-docker-pre-release/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been one of the most discussed topics in technology in recent years, especially with its rapid advancements over the past two years. From deep learning and natural language processing to computer vision and automated decision systems, AI applications are constantly emerging. However, despite continuous technological breakthroughs, AI still faces a bottleneck similar to that of Docker before its release – a lack of a killer application to truly ignite the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of AI over the past two years is similar to the state before Docker&amp;rsquo;s release – lacking a killer application. It needs a perfect practical implementation based on existing technology, like Docker: not relying on groundbreaking new technologies, but offering a complete and reasonable solution that transforms operations and development workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-current-state-of-ai-development-technology-is-mature-but-application-still-needs-breakthroughs&#34;&gt;The current state of AI development: technology is mature, but application still needs breakthroughs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, AI has made significant progress in the past two years. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s OpenAI’s GPT series models or Google’s BERT and DeepMind’s Alpha series, AI processing capabilities have far exceeded previous expectations. Particularly in natural language processing, models like GPT-4 not only possess powerful generation abilities but also demonstrate astonishing performance in understanding and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite rapid technological advancements, the practical application of AI faces certain challenges. Similar to the state before Docker&amp;rsquo;s release, while AI has immense potential, a truly widespread and industry-transforming &amp;ldquo;killer&amp;rdquo; application hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet emerged. People discuss AI’s prospects but may struggle to find an application that can bring revolutionary change. Many AI applications remain in early experimental stages and require further integration and optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-similarity-between-docker-and-ai-technology-isnt-necessarily-innovation-solutions-are-key&#34;&gt;The similarity between Docker and AI: Technology isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily innovation, solutions are key
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the history before Docker&amp;rsquo;s release, we find striking similarities with the current state of AI development. Prior to Docker, container technology wasn&amp;rsquo;t new; early technologies like LXC (Linux Containers) and virtualization already possessed basic containerization capabilities. However, Docker cleverly integrated and optimized existing technologies, proposing a simpler, more intuitive, and efficient solution. This approach didn’t introduce revolutionary technology but addressed many pain points in operations and development processes, significantly simplifying software deployment, scaling, and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the AI field faces a similar situation. While current AI technology is no longer &amp;ldquo;new,&amp;rdquo; achieving widespread application still requires a perfect implementation scenario – like Docker, integrating and optimizing existing technologies to form a practical solution. The “killer” application of AI may not depend on breakthrough new technologies, but rather on how to integrate existing ones to solve real-world business pain points and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-ais-docker-moment&#34;&gt;How to find AI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Docker moment&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve widespread application of AI technology, several aspects need to be addressed&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, many AI applications remain experimental and lack large-scale practical implementation. While areas like AI customer service and intelligent recommendations are widely used, their functionality is still limited and hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet overcome industry bottlenecks. True breakthroughs may come from industries long burdened by traditional methods—such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics—where AI can improve efficiency and reduce costs through more efficient data processing and predictive analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

Just as Docker improves operational efficiency by streamlining the containerization process, the usability of AI products is equally crucial. The popularization of AI isn&amp;rsquo;t just about technology; it’s about productization. Integrating AI into daily workflows and enabling users to easily utilize these tools without needing a deep understanding of the underlying technology is a key step in its successful implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
The widespread adoption of any new technology hinges on building a robust ecosystem. Docker&amp;rsquo;s rapid rise is due to its openness and compatibility, allowing developers to easily connect with various cloud platforms, tools, and services. Similarly, the future of AI depends on ecosystem development. Standardization, model sharing, data accessibility, and technical integration will all influence whether AI can achieve broad industry applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-the-future-of-ai-is-full-of-possibilities-but-still-requires-more-robust-implementation-plans&#34;&gt;Conclusion: The future of AI is full of possibilities, but still requires more robust implementation plans
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite significant advancements in AI technology over the past two years, it remains in a stage without a killer application. Similar to containerization technology before Docker&amp;rsquo;s release, AI needs a practical application scenario that deeply integrates existing technologies with business needs to achieve widespread adoption and scale. While technological innovation is important, solutions that simplify processes and improve efficiency are more likely to drive the popularization and development of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, AI may not revolutionize through groundbreaking technology, but rather create a perfect application scenario by integrating existing technologies—ultimately transforming how we work and live&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Protobuf Zero-Value Trap: When Defaults Become Silent Killers of Business Logic</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/protobuf-zero-value-traps/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:26:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/protobuf-zero-value-traps/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;US stocks have three trading periods: pre-market, intra-market, and post-market. The data push logic (to minimize bandwidth usage) sends the full dataset once initially, then pushes incremental updates for all subsequent fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not use the optimal solution? It involves different project teams, some of which have been live for many years. We are newly integrated, so we can only try to maintain compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-series-of-questions&#34;&gt;A series of questions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the abstract alone, there might not seem to be a problem. However, bringing this system architecture into the problem-solving process has triggered a series of issues. Just as one issue was resolved, another arose, stemming from the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unable-to-identify-trading-period&#34;&gt;Unable to identify trading period
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the in-memory stage is defined as the default value or the actual business value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple understanding: Receiving a 0 each time makes it impossible to determine whether it&amp;rsquo;s a new quote setting or the default value of Protobuf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduce-optional&#34;&gt;Introduce optional
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since protobuf release 3.15, proto3 supports using the optional keyword (just as in proto2) to give a scalar field presence information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal communication protocol is based on &lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;BOLD_3&lt;code&gt;optional&lt;/code&gt;BOLD_4&lt;code&gt;protobuf&lt;/code&gt;, and the project&amp;rsquo;s underlying implementation uses a static library, which requires upgrading the entire compilation chain. This cost is very high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gcc-version-issue&#34;&gt;GCC version issue
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After much deliberation, we devised a plan to release two different versions at the underlying level, aiming to carefully control new features&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commonly used server types within the group: CentOS 7, CentOS 8. The default version of CentOS 7 is above 7.4, so CentOS 7 is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=82461&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Bug 82461 - [7 Regression] Temporary required for brace-initializing (non-literal-type) member variable&lt;/a&gt;。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some troubleshooting, moving the related services and compilation server to CentOS 8 resolved the issue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reasonable-enumeration&#34;&gt;Reasonable Enumeration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the entire issue, there&amp;rsquo;s a simpler and more efficient solution: adjust the enumeration definition to start numbering from 1 instead of 0. This effectively distinguishes default values from business values, avoiding the aforementioned series of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-is-starting-from-1-more-reasonable&#34;&gt;Why is starting from 1 more reasonable?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In C++, the default value of an enumeration type is fixed at 0. If we define a meaningful business value as 0 (e.g., &amp;ldquo;in-plate&amp;rdquo;), the downstream system cannot determine whether the received 0 represents a business value or an unset default value during incremental push. However, if enumerations are defined starting from 1, 0 can be reserved for a meaningless default value or an &amp;ldquo;unknown&amp;rdquo; state, resolving the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggested practices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When designing Protobuf enums, always define 0 as a meaningless default value
Assign actual business values starting from 1, ensuring distinction from the default value of 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small adjustment not only resolved the trading period identification issue but also provided a valuable lesson for future protocol design&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A dramatic market shift before and after National Day: soaring highs followed by plunging lows</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/national-holiday-stock-market-rollercoaster/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:42:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/national-holiday-stock-market-rollercoaster/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of China&amp;rsquo;s National Day holiday in 2024, the stock market saw a remarkable surge, followed by a dramatic plunge after the break. This &amp;ldquo;rollercoaster&amp;rdquo; experience for investors has prompted deep reflection on policy, economics, and market dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation: &amp;ldquo;Written as a news report, this blog post focuses on the stock market surge preceding last year’s National Day holiday, followed by the subsequent sharp decline after the holiday.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-surge-before-national-day-a-policy-driven-frenzy&#34;&gt;Stock market surge before National Day: A policy-driven frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the five trading days leading up to China&amp;rsquo;s National Day in 2024, the Chinese stock market surged from a slump into a &amp;ldquo;boiling&amp;rdquo; state. On September 30th, A-share markets saw broad gains with significant volume; major indices all reached historic highs. The Shanghai Index rose 8.06%, the Shenzhen Component Index climbed 10.67%, and the Growth Enterprise Market Index soared 15.36%. The B share index set a record for the largest single-day increase, jumping 22.84%. Market sentiment was extremely bullish, with daily turnover on Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing exchanges reaching 2.61 trillion yuan – a substantial increase of 1.1559 trillion yuan from the previous trading day. Over 5300 stocks across all markets rose collectively, creating a &amp;ldquo;sea of red&amp;rdquo; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving force behind this recent market rally stems from the concentrated release of a series of unexpected government policies and the resulting shifts in market expectations. On September 24th, the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China announced measures including cutting the reserve requirement ratio, lowering interest rates, reducing mortgage rates on existing loans, and unifying minimum down payment ratios for mortgages. The Central Political Bureau meeting on September 26th emphasized increasing counter-cyclical adjustments through fiscal and monetary policies to boost capital markets and encourage long-term funds to enter the market. On September 30th, a cluster of four real estate support policies were introduced. These measures demonstrate the government&amp;rsquo;s determination to stabilize the market and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-national-day-stock-market-plunge-calmness-and-adjustment-after-the-celebration&#34;&gt;Post-National Day Stock Market Plunge: Calmness and Adjustment After the Celebration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, market sentiment plummeted after the National Day holiday. On October 8th, A-shares opened strongly with near limit-up gains, but following this sharp opening, the market experienced significant volatility, ultimately closing higher than it opened but lower than it closed. Since then, the market&amp;rsquo;s focus has continued to decline; as of October 16th, the Shanghai Composite Index saw a swing of over 15% and a cumulative drop of more than 470 points. From October 8th to 10th, core A-share indices across the board declined, with the Growth Enterprise Market Index falling by 6.21%.
This recent sharp decline is due to a combination of factors: digesting risks accumulated from previous rapid gains, and adjustments in market expectations regarding policy. Some investors believe the short-term effects of policies are already apparent, while long-term results remain to be seen. Volatility in overseas markets has also impacted A-shares. On October 9th, the Hang Seng Index plummeted 9.41% and the A50 futures contract fell 10.4%, further intensifying the market&amp;rsquo;s downturn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflection-on-and-prospects-for-the-market&#34;&gt;Reflection on and Prospects for the Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp market fluctuations before and after National Day have prompted deep reflection on policy, the economy, and market dynamics. While policy stimulus has shown a significant short-term effect, its long-term impact remains to be seen. The rapid market rises and falls also serve as a reminder for investors to remain rational and avoid emotional investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether A-share market can achieve a genuine &amp;ldquo;long-term bull&amp;rdquo; trend still depends on whether policies effectively reach the real economy and ultimately drive substantial improvements in economic fundamentals. Investors should closely monitor policy implementation and changes in economic data, adjusting their investment strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market&amp;rsquo;s surge and subsequent crash around National Day were a contest between policy and the market, as well as a test of investor psychology. This &amp;ldquo;extreme&amp;rdquo; volatility revealed both the power of the market and the influence of policy. We will see how the market unfolds next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Nezha breaks out during Spring Festival season</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-nizha-breakthrough/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:40:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-nizha-breakthrough/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For Chinese people, watching movies has become an essential entertainment during the Spring Festival season when families reunite. This year&amp;rsquo;s Spring Festival film releases were dominated by &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha,&amp;rdquo; which was incredibly popular and sparked widespread discussion. The buzz surrounding it is reminiscent of “Wolf Warrior,” both films carrying a strong patriotic theme that evokes a sense of national pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unexpected success of &amp;ldquo;Nezha&amp;rdquo; during the Spring Festival season, sparking a sense of national pride reminiscent of films like &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior,&amp;rdquo; demonstrates a patriotic theme. While acknowledging significant progress, the film isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as impressive as some claim. As a gamer, I find many aspects feel overly slick and the fight scenes lean heavily towards an MMO style. Numerous reports indicate people buying tickets to see it but ultimately not going due to its performance pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fight-scenes-lack-texture&#34;&gt;The fight scenes lack texture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a gamer, I usually spend my days immersed in online games and didn&amp;rsquo;t have high expectations for movies. But the buzz around &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; was undeniable; everyone was talking about it, so I figured I’d check it out. Once I entered the theater and saw the visuals, I felt a jolt. While the production quality has improved considerably, some scenes looked a bit greasy. And the fight sequences? They were too heavily influenced by online game aesthetics. Having played games for so long, this visual style is too similar to certain in-game environments, lacking the texture one expects from a film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crazy-movie-fans&#34;&gt;Crazy movie fans
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing the movie, I checked online and saw that quite a few people bought tickets for &amp;ldquo;The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Child&amp;rdquo; but didn&amp;rsquo;t actually watch it, all to boost its box office. That’s impressive dedication – clearly, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of enthusiasm for this film, and everyone wants to do something to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s recall &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; when Wu Jing shouted, “Whoever dares offend China will be punished no matter how far away they are,” many people were thrilled and felt that our Chinese military was so powerful, and our country so strong. While &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; doesn’t have such direct patriotic slogans, it vividly showcases traditional Chinese culture. We grew up listening to the stories of mythological figures like Nezha and Ao Bing; the film portrays their conflicts, love, and growth with depth and emotion – isn&amp;rsquo;t that the charm of Chinese culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Nezha. Misunderstood and looked down upon since childhood, yet he refused to give in, declaring &amp;ldquo;My fate is my own, not the heavens&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; That spirit is so much like the resilience ingrained in us Chinese people. No matter how great the difficulty, we don’t back down, but strive to change our destiny through effort. Ao Bing also exemplifies this – burdened by a family mission, seemingly cold but truly kind-hearted, willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. We often see such friendship and responsibility in real life, don&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advancement-of-animated-films&#34;&gt;Advancement of animated films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &amp;ldquo;The Devils Who Laugh&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, it effectively combines traditional Chinese culture with modern film technology, showcasing the progress of Chinese animation. Just as &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; demonstrated a breakthrough for Chinese cinema in action films, this kind of advancement gives us hope that Chinese movies can shine on the international stage and allow foreigners to appreciate the brilliance of Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chinese people, wherever we go, we carry our nation and culture in our hearts. Films like &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; are like keys, unlocking a sense of national pride deep within us. They allow us to experience the strength of our country and the charm of our culture amidst laughter and joy, inspiring us to work hard in our respective fields and contribute to the prosperity and development of our nation. This is likely why these films have become so popular and resonate with such strong feelings of national pride. We hope for more films like this in the future, to keep this sense of pride brimming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Troubleshooting TCP Communication Anomalies in Backend Services</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:54:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Business model: The backend service establishes a connection with the group&amp;rsquo;s market gateway via TCP. Each connection requires an initial authorization request, followed by continuous heartbeat packets to maintain connection status.
However, one day, an alert about a service disconnection was received. After carefully checking the logs, it was discovered that the backend service continuously sent heartbeat packets, but there was no response from the other party, yet the connection never disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-overview&#34;&gt;Brief Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was working late at the office, pushing forward project progress, when an alert suddenly popped up in our work group. At first glance, I thought it was just a network timeout causing heartbeat failures and service disconnections. However, after carefully checking the logs, the situation proved to be different. The backend had sent authorization login messages, but received no response. Meanwhile, heartbeats continued to be sent, yet there was no reply whatsoever. In-depth analysis of the logs revealed several key issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authorization message failed due to no response: This is likely because the other system is restarting, preventing timely processing of the authorization message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The heartbeat data was sent despite unsuccessful authorization. Investigation revealed a flaw in the program logic: the heartbeat sending function&amp;rsquo;s judgment logic is defective, only checking connection status but omitting authorization status verification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the service can disconnect, it will trigger a reconnection mechanism to resend authorization messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, one last critical issue remains: why the connection has not been disconnected. Resolving this requires more in-depth and detailed troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analyze-network-packets&#34;&gt;Analyze network packets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To capture network packets for further analysis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.ttf248.life/p/backend-service-tcp-communication-troubleshooting/20250220151952.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1126&#34;
	height=&#34;202&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;tcpdump&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;557&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;1337px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the data in the graph, I can see that the heartbeat was consistently being sent, but no data was received from the other server. However, it provided &lt;code&gt;ACK&lt;/code&gt;, which prevented the connection from disconnecting automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;common-flag-explanations&#34;&gt;Common Flag Explanations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the TCP protocol, &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;（Push）和 &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_1&lt;/strong&gt; (Acknowledgments) are two important flags used to control data transmission and flow confirmation. Their functions are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-pshpush-flag&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. PSH（Push Flag）&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;功能&lt;/strong&gt;:
Request that the receiver immediately push the data from the buffer to the upper-layer application&amp;rsquo;s data segment, processing and forwarding it as quickly as possible rather than storing it in the operating system buffer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;典型场景&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients expect immediate responses from the server when sending requests (e.g., ping)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each keyboard input triggers &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt;, ensuring real-time character transmission&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-latency scenarios such as video streaming and online games may use &lt;em&gt;edge computing&lt;/em&gt; to reduce latency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;注意&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This flag is not mandatory; the recipient can choose to ignore it (but should still process the data normally)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sender may not set &lt;code&gt;PSH&lt;/code&gt;, in which case the receiver will decide when to push data based on its own buffering strategy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-ackacknowledgment-flag&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. ACK（Acknowledgment Flag）&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;功能&lt;/strong&gt;:
Confirmation that the preceding data segment has been correctly received (indicated by the expected next byte sequence number). It is a core mechanism for reliable transmission in TCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;工作原理&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sending a data segment, the sender will carry the expected recipient&amp;rsquo;s (ID)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon receiving the data, the receiver generates an acknowledgment segment confirming the received sequence number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sender will only retransmit unacknowledged data after receiving the corresponding confirmation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;示例&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the sender sent sequence number 5, 6, and 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the recipient does not receive confirmation from the sender regarding retransmission&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;INLINE_CODE_0__ 和 &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_1&lt;/strong&gt; can occur simultaneously in a TCP message, commonly seen in the following scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

        <title>Making money takes time; rushing it wont help</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:30:24 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on years of stock trading, while I haven&amp;rsquo;t made a fortune, I also haven&amp;rsquo;t lost too much. The biggest issue is an unreasonable cash flow plan and unstable mindset. Currently, my primary income comes from work – a fixed salary. My tolerance for financial fluctuations remains at the level of bonds and bank deposits. However, people are inherently greedy; buying too little means you won’t profit when prices rise, while buying too much leads to losses when they fall. A stable mindset is therefore crucial; it helps steady our ship of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing through stock trading: The importance of mindset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-loss-cases&#34;&gt;Historical Loss Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides dabbling in small-cap and newly listed stocks when I first started, the investments I&amp;rsquo;ve focused on since have been primarily blue-chip large-cap stocks: Industrial Bank, China Unicom, Hengan Electronics, ZTE, and various large-cap index funds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it stemmed from greed wanting more—rushing to increase holdings at the start, then facing a cash flow crisis. Expenses like insurance, buying property, and getting married were major drains on funds; the overall plan lacked sufficient financial buffer, leading to later shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy blue-chip stocks, it&amp;rsquo;s like relying on [someone] dependable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Evergrande ran into problems, bank stocks plummeted, allowing for a successful opportunity to sell off. However, this demonstrates a flawed understanding of the broader economy – real estate&amp;rsquo;s share in the national economy is too significant, with far-reaching implications that cannot be ignored. The subsequent market decline and the sustained rise of dividend stocks over roughly two years reflect this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The early stages of the trade war saw significant damage, with stock prices falling sharply, but they gradually recovered afterward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This stock belongs to the former employer. After Ant Financial&amp;rsquo;s divestiture, the price dropped significantly, but it has market makers who can push it up several times a year. With proper position sizing, losses will be minimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;greed-the-monster-that-devours-reason&#34;&gt;Greed: The &amp;ldquo;monster&amp;rdquo; that devours reason
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When stock prices rise steadily and investors&amp;rsquo; paper profits increase, greed quietly takes root. Many, seeing prices already at high levels, still fantasize about continued upward trends and seek greater returns, unwilling to take profits. Blinded by greed, they forget market rules and the existence of risk. For example, during speculative surges in certain hot-topic stocks, some investors, witnessing short-term doubling or even multiple times increases, become deeply involved, continuously adding positions with the hope of being the last winners. However, markets don&amp;rsquo;t stay exuberant forever; when bubbles burst and prices plummet, these greed-driven investors often suffer heavy losses. Greed robs them of their ability to analyze and decide rationally, turning them into &amp;ldquo;gamblers&amp;rdquo; rather than wise investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-shackles-binding-your-hands-and-feet&#34;&gt;Fear: Shackles binding your hands and feet
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is the opposite of greed. Fear is equally destructive in the stock market. When market conditions turn sharply downward and prices plummet, investors easily panic. This fear erodes their confidence; even with fundamentally sound stocks, they rush to sell to avoid further losses. For example, during the global financial crisis, many high-quality blue-chip stocks also fell dramatically. Some investors, overwhelmed by fear, failed to recognize the long-term value of these companies and sold their shares at rock-bottom prices, missing out on substantial returns from subsequent market rebounds and company performance growth. Fear not only causes short-term losses but can also create a lasting psychological shadow, deterring them from re-entering the market and causing them to miss investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blindly-following-trends-a-fog-that-obscures-direction&#34;&gt;Blindly following trends: A &amp;ldquo;fog&amp;rdquo; that obscures direction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blindly following the crowd is another common psychological trap for investors in stock trading and wealth management. In an era of information overload, investment advice, market rumors, and trending news abound. Many investors lack independent thinking and judgment skills, blindly imitating others&amp;rsquo; actions. Seeing others profit from buying a particular stock, they rush to buy without careful consideration; hearing so-called &amp;ldquo;insider tips,&amp;rdquo; they invest everything they have. This blind following neglects the necessary research and analysis of individual stocks, leaving investors lost like ships in fog, losing their direction. For example, some concept stocks may generate short-term gains for followers initially, but as hype fades, prices plummet, turning those unaware and blindly following into &amp;ldquo;bag holders.&amp;rdquo; They fail to realize that each investor has different risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizons; what works for others might not work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overconfidence-a-hidden-shoal&#34;&gt;Overconfidence: A Hidden &amp;ldquo;Shoal&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence is a significant issue in the mindset of stock and financial investments. After experiencing initial investment successes, some investors become inflated with pride, believing they have mastered market patterns and can accurately predict price movements. They disregard the complexity and uncertainty of the market, leading to excessive trading, blindly expanding their investment scale, and even using high leverage for speculation. However, the market is unpredictable, and overconfident investors often suffer significant losses from unexpected market fluctuations. For example, inexperienced but initially successful investors may believe they possess professional investment skills and begin frequent buying and selling while continuously increasing their investments. When systemic risks or negative news about individual stocks emerge, they fail to stop their losses in time due to their overconfidence, resulting in substantial capital erosion. Overconfidence is like a submerged reef, appearing calm and harmless on the surface but capable of wrecking an investor&amp;rsquo;s financial ship unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-for-sound-financial-management&#34;&gt;How to adjust your mindset for sound financial management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a correct investment philosophy: Investors should understand that stock trading and wealth management are for the long-term, stable growth of assets, not for getting rich quick. Through learning investment knowledge, understanding market patterns, and adopting value investing and long-term investment principles, avoid being swayed by short-term gains and market sentiment. For example, thoroughly research a company&amp;rsquo;s fundamentals – its profitability, industry position, management team, etc. – to select stocks with long-term investment value, rather than blindly chasing short-term trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a sound investment plan: Based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals, create a scientific and reasonable plan. Clearly define key elements such as investment amount, timeframe, expected return, and stop-loss point, and adhere to the plan strictly. This helps avoid impulsive decisions driven by emotional fluctuations. For example, limit each stock&amp;rsquo;s allocation to a certain percentage of your total assets; take profits when prices reach your target gains, and cut losses decisively when they hit your stop-loss level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control your emotions and stay calm: When facing market volatility, learn to manage your emotions and remain calm and rational. Relieve investment pressure through methods like distraction, exercise, and communication. Avoid letting emotions negatively impact your investment decisions. When the market experiences significant fluctuations, first calmly analyze the reasons, combine your investment strategy with the fundamentals of the stocks, and make a rational judgment instead of blindly following trends or panicking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous learning and reflection are essential in the ever-evolving stock market. Investors must consistently acquire new knowledge and skills, stay informed about macroeconomic trends, industry developments, and company information to improve their investment capabilities. Regularly reflecting on investment behavior, summarizing lessons learned, identifying issues with mindset and decision-making, and making timely adjustments are also crucial. For example, after each investment, review the entire process, analyze successes and failures, and consider how to avoid similar errors in future investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in the stock market is a long and challenging journey where mindset plays a crucial role. Maintaining rationality, composure, humility, and independent thinking are essential for navigating market volatility and achieving wealth preservation and growth. Investors should consider cultivating a positive mindset as a fundamental part of their investment process, enabling them to steer their financial future successfully.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Alternative fantasies and emotional attachments shaped by time</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</link>

        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the earliest online literature readers enter middle age, the genre has evolved. Protagonists now frequently appear as fathers, mentors, or elderly individuals, catering to middle-aged readers&amp;rsquo; changing needs for life and emotion. These works no longer solely focus on leveling up and defying the odds; instead, they emphasize emotional resonance and life reflections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;target-audience-evolving-readership-over-time&#34;&gt;Target audience: Evolving readership over time
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former online literature readers are now mostly middle-aged. Having experienced life&amp;rsquo;s challenges, their perspectives and values have shifted. The youthful pursuits of action and adventure no longer hold the same appeal. Instead, they seek emotional resonance with their current lives, memories of past years, and hopes for the future through reading. Middle-aged &amp;ldquo;爽文&amp;rdquo; (refreshing/satisfying novels) emerged to meet this psychological need, attracting readers with storylines that closely reflect the realities and mindset of middle-aged individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;character-transformation-from-young-hero-to-middle-aged-responsibility&#34;&gt;Character Transformation: From Young Hero to Middle-Aged Responsibility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After becoming a master, the protagonist Lu Zhou faces a group of apprentices with diverse personalities and formidable strength. They waver between good and evil, while Lu Zhou must guide them towards righteousness. This novel explores the challenges and dilemmas faced by a middle-aged person teaching the next generation through interactions between the protagonist and his apprentices. The growth and transformation of these apprentices also offer readers hope and a glimpse into the future, reflecting their own expectations for their children or younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emotional-resonance-reflections-on-life-and-family-responsibility&#34;&gt;Emotional Resonance: Reflections on Life and Family Responsibility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protagonist gains a system on their 60th birthday, embarking on a new life journey. This premise resonates with middle-aged readers by offering a sense of &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not too late&amp;rdquo; hope and inspiration. Despite reaching old age, the protagonist can still realize their value and dreams through the system. This storyline prompts reflection on missed opportunities and unfulfilled aspirations, while also conveying a positive attitude towards life, encouraging people to pursue their goals at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-design-reflecting-the-rhythm-and-fun-of-middle-aged-life&#34;&gt;Plot design: Reflecting the rhythm and fun of middle-aged life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plots in mid-life &amp;ldquo;refreshing&amp;rdquo; novels often focus more on life&amp;rsquo;s details and nuanced emotional expression. Unlike the fast-paced leveling and adventure common in younger works, they prioritize relationships and emotional conflicts between characters. For example, in &amp;ldquo;Strongest Master,&amp;rdquo; the detailed portrayal of the master-apprentice bond and brotherhood among peers resonates with readers, evoking feelings of warmth and familiarity—a reflection of their own familial, friendly, and romantic experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Mystery of Spring Festival Movie Ticket Prices: Differences Between Online and Offline Sales</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/spring-festival-movie-tickets-price-mystery-online-vs-offline/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:02:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/spring-festival-movie-tickets-price-mystery-online-vs-offline/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the Spring Festival, a family of seven or eight wanted to see a movie. We planned to buy tickets on Taopihao and Maoyan, but saw the price was 60 yuan. Luckily, we had a cinema recharge card that required purchasing tickets at the front desk in person. Thinking to ask about any discounts, we were surprised to find the same showing only cost 35 yuan there – quite a difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hidden-platform-fees&#34;&gt;Hidden platform fees
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While online ticketing platforms offer convenience, their service fees are significant. They invest in user-friendly features like seat selection and purchase history tracking, which require funding. These costs are passed on to the customer through service fees, resulting in higher ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cinema-differentiation-strategies&#34;&gt;Cinema Differentiation Strategies
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand for movie tickets during the Spring Festival is surging, and theaters are using tiered pricing to maximize profits. Online platforms have high traffic, so many people buy tickets in advance online, resulting in higher prices for those tickets. Meanwhile, walk-in customers buying at the front desk receive lower prices to attract them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pricing-logic-behind-profit-sharing&#34;&gt;The pricing logic behind profit sharing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online platforms and cinemas cooperate through revenue-sharing models that affect ticket prices. To ensure profitability, platforms take a percentage of the box office, leading to higher ticket costs. Cinema counters, without intermediary fees, offer more affordable tickets due to lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips-for-buying-tickets&#34;&gt;Tips for Buying Tickets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t just look at online platforms when buying tickets. Try calling the cinema directly or visiting the front desk – you might find a surprise. If you’re a frequent moviegoer, consider getting a membership card to enjoy member discounts and save money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>An Analysis of Political Elements in 2025 Spring Festival Films</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-new-year-films-2025/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:49:42 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-new-year-films-2025/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I went out during Spring Festival season, but this time I saw two movies and had a different feeling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the new trends in the 2025 Spring Festival film season, focusing on &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;New Deity: The Magchild Incites the Sea.&amp;rdquo; The former uses the backdrop of San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown in 1900 to depict the discrimination and oppression faced by Chinese people, reflecting the social and political environment. The latter, as an animated film, employs rich metaphorical elements to satirize the current international political landscape—for example, Jade Pure Palace resembling the Pentagon alluding to the American political system, dollar signs on the Tianyuan Cauldron symbolizing US dollar hegemony, the Immortal Jade Tablet mirroring the green card suggesting hierarchical status, and the Soul-Destroying Pill akin to biological weapons hinting at malicious actions. Both films offer a new viewing experience and prompt reflection on the relationship between cinematic art and political expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovation-in-spring-festival-film-styles&#34;&gt;Innovation in Spring Festival film styles
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Spring Festival films have been lighthearted and family-friendly, aiming to help audiences relax during the holiday season and rarely addressing sensitive political topics. However, this year&amp;rsquo;s 2025 Spring Festival lineup breaks with convention; &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;New God of War: Nezha Revolution&amp;rdquo; incorporate rich political elements, sparking widespread discussion among viewers and ushering in a new era for Spring Festival films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-vivid-reflection-of-the-eras-politics&#34;&gt;A Vivid Reflection of the Era&amp;rsquo;s Politics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Lost Tiger&amp;rdquo; is set in 1900 San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown, a time when Chinese immigrants faced severe racial discrimination and oppression. As the protagonists investigate a case, they must navigate not only the mystery but also societal prejudice and unfair treatment. The film’s portrayal of racism and power struggles realistically reflects the social and political climate of the era, revealing the arduous struggle for survival and dignity undertaken by Chinese immigrants during that turbulent time—a situation with underlying political issues worthy of deeper consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This historical context inevitably brings to mind the current challenges faced by overseas Chinese in the business world, such as the TikTok and Zhou Shuzhong incident&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 6, 2024, local time, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected TikTok&amp;rsquo;s request, upholding the constitutionality of a law requiring its sale on national security grounds. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew wrote in a memo to employees that the next step will be &amp;ldquo;seeking an injunction and awaiting review by the U.S. Supreme Court.&amp;rdquo; The event stems from the “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications” law, which mandates that ByteDance divest its U.S. TikTok operations within 270 days of the bill&amp;rsquo;s passage, with a final sale deadline of January 19, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Shou Zi Chew faced numerous challenges at various hearings. On January 31, 2024, during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on &amp;ldquo;Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis,&amp;rdquo; prominent anti-China lawmaker Tom Cotton repeatedly questioned him with 8 nationality-related inquiries, including his own citizenship, whether he had applied for Chinese or American citizenship, and even the nationalities of his wife and children. Despite the hearing&amp;rsquo;s focus being on online child sexual exploitation, the senator shifted the topic to TikTok’s ownership by the Chinese company ByteDance, forcing Chew to answer questions unrelated to the theme. Similar to the unwarranted discrimination faced by Chinese in &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900,&amp;rdquo; Shou Zi Chew is experiencing unfair treatment and scrutiny in the business world due to TikTok&amp;rsquo;s background. These events reflect that overseas Chinese have consistently encountered significant external obstacles when pursuing their own development and protecting their rights across different eras. Whether it was racial discrimination a century ago or today’s political maneuvering in commerce, these situations warrant deep reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-analysis-of-the-political-metaphors-behind-ne-zha-the-demon-child&#34;&gt;An Analysis of the Political Metaphors Behind &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha: The Demon Child&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While appearing as an ordinary animated film, &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha: The Demon Child&amp;rdquo; is rich with political allegories in its settings and plot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jade Void Palace is portrayed as the supreme power center of the realm, with an architectural style similar to the Pentagon, predominantly white in color, symbolizing Western powers using &amp;ldquo;universal values&amp;rdquo; as a pretext for hegemony. The “Demon Eradication Team,” led by the Limitless Immortal Elder, and its subordinates, Lù Nán and Hè Nǚ, are seen as corresponding to the US alliance system involving Japan and South Korea. The Jade Void Palace’s “online meeting” scene, with the Twelve Golden Immortals discussing the &amp;ldquo;War of the Conferred Gods,&amp;rdquo; mirrors a NATO summit led by the United States, ostensibly maintaining order while suppressing other nations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tianyuan Cauldron, used for alchemy in Yuxu Palace, features dollar signs at its entrance, symbolizing how the United States &amp;ldquo;alchemizes&amp;rdquo; resources from other nations through economic hegemony. In the film, Wuliang Xianweng throws the dragon clan into the cauldron under the guise of “acting on behalf of heaven,” mirroring certain countries exploiting others by leveraging &amp;ldquo;international rules.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nezha&amp;rsquo;s immortal identity jade pendant, with its color and design resembling the U.S. green card, symbolizes the celestial realm’s exclusion and stratification of “outsiders,” hinting at the identity differences and unequal treatment between different countries and groups in reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The forced consumption of the Soul-Destroying Pill by Nezha, compelled by the Immortal Wonderman, resembles a bioweapon and satirizes certain nations that, under the guise of &amp;ldquo;saving the world,&amp;rdquo; engage in destruction and devastation abroad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Seven-Colored Treasure Lotus, crucial for reshaping the bodies of Nezha and Ao Bing, symbolizes energy and technology lifelines monopolized by powerful nations. Obtaining its “essence” requires passing the Yu Xu Palace’s “immortality exam,” reflecting developing countries&amp;rsquo; dependence on core resources and exploitation within a hegemonic system. The lotus’s temporary failure and recovery conditions allude to small nations’ survival challenges amidst energy crises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-deep-reflection-on-film-art-and-political-expression&#34;&gt;A Deep Reflection on Film Art and Political Expression
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These films, integrated with political elements during the nationwide Chinese New Year moviegoing boom, offer audiences a new viewing experience—no longer just entertainment, but more like a mirror reflecting political issues within history and reality. This prompts deeper reflection on the relationship between cinematic art and political expression. Will directors increasingly convey their views on society and politics through film? Can cinema, as a powerful cultural medium, balance artistic expression with greater attention to and contemplation of social realities? These questions warrant thorough exploration while enjoying films, and we look forward to more exciting developments from the film industry in fusing art and reality.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The two major U.S. political parties—the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.</title>

        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:40:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Democratic and Republican parties have significant differences in political ideology, policy proposals, and social values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;political-ideology-and-policy-proposals&#34;&gt;Political Ideology and Policy Proposals
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Party leans liberal, advocating for government involvement in economic and social matters. It supports social welfare programs, environmental protection, and multiculturalism. On taxation, the party favors tax cuts for low-to-middle income groups while raising rates on high earners and corporations. Regarding social issues, it supports abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and strict gun control. In foreign policy, the Democratic Party emphasizes multilateralism and diplomacy, preferring to resolve global issues through international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party leans conservative, advocating for limited government intervention and emphasizing individual freedom and a market economy. On tax policy, they support across-the-board tax cuts, believing they should benefit all income levels. Regarding social issues, they oppose abortion and same-sex marriage and support the right to bear arms. In foreign policy, they tend towards a hawkish stance, supporting the use of military force to protect national interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-significance-of-trumps-rise-to-power&#34;&gt;The significance of Trump&amp;rsquo;s rise to power
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s re-election as U.S. President in 2024 signifies the Republican Party’s dominance in American politics. Trump’s policy positions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump advocates for economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation, particularly supporting the development of traditional manufacturing and energy industries. He also favors protectionist trade policies, renegotiating or withdrawing from existing trade agreements to protect American economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump plans to strengthen border security, restrict illegal immigration, and impose stricter screening and limitations on legal immigrants. He also supports limiting refugee and asylum claims to protect national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump favors unilateralism, emphasizes &amp;ldquo;America First,&amp;rdquo; reduces reliance on international organizations, reassesses relations with allies, and employs tougher diplomacy when necessary. He also plans to expand fossil fuel production and usage while easing environmental restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second Trump term could lead to significant shifts in US domestic policy and have far-reaching impacts on global politics and economics. His policies are likely to draw international attention and responses, particularly regarding trade, environment, and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Deploy DeepSeek-R1 locally</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/ollama-local-deployment-deepseek-r1/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:41:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/ollama-local-deployment-deepseek-r1/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ollama is an open-source AI tool designed to enable users to run and deploy large language models (LLMs) locally. It aims to provide a convenient and efficient way for developers to use models like GPT on their local machines without relying on cloud services. Ollama supports various models and focuses on optimizing performance so that even resource-constrained devices can run them smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Ollama, users can utilize text-based AI applications and interact with locally deployed models without concerns about data privacy or high API usage fees. You can call different models through a command-line interface (CLI) for tasks like natural language processing and question answering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ollama is good for trying out different models. The Windows version doesn&amp;rsquo;t fully utilize hardware performance, likely due to Windows itself. The Linux version might be better. Deploying a 32B parameter model results in slow responses even with low memory and GPU load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hardware-overview&#34;&gt;Hardware Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating system: win11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU：i7-10700K&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory: 40GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics card: RTX 3060 12GB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;environment-setup&#34;&gt;Environment Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added system environment variable for future use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_MODELS=E:\ollama&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This variable specifies the storage path for Ollama models. &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; is a folder path where all local model files are stored. Ollama loads and uses your downloaded or deployed language models based on this path. You can store the model files in other locations by changing this path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:8000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This environment variable sets the host and port for the Ollama service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; is a local address (localhost), meaning that the Ollama service will only listen for requests from the local machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; is the designated port number, indicating that the Ollama service will listen for and process requests on port 8000. You can change the port number as needed, but ensure it&amp;rsquo;s not occupied by another application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;set OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This environment variable controls which sources of requests are allowed to access the Ollama service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; indicates that any origin (i.e., all domains and IP addresses) is allowed to access the Ollama service. This is typically used in development and debugging environments; in production, more restrictive source control is usually specified to limit access to specific domains or IPs for enhanced security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deepseek-r1-model-deployment&#34;&gt;DeepSeek-R1 Model Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ollama installation is straightforward; details are omitted here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-installation verification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;C:\Users\core&amp;gt;ollama -v
ollama version is 0.5.11
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Model deployment, refer to the official model page and select the corresponding parameters for the model: &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 14B parameter model effectively remembers conversation context; smaller versions do not. The 32B parameter version is too slow for local deployment, so further testing was not conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>PowerShell 7 and Persistent Settings Command-Line Prediction View</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/powershell-7-persisting-settings-command-line-prediction-view/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:19:12 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/powershell-7-persisting-settings-command-line-prediction-view/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having been accustomed to zsh on Linux, I recently discovered that PowerShell 7 also supports persistent settings for command-line prediction views. I tried it out and found it quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what action was taken, but this feature is enabled – it just appeared&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s diverse operating system environment, system administrators and developers are seeking a cross-platform, efficient, and powerful tool to meet their needs for system management and automation. PowerShell 7 is such a highly anticipated tool, offering robust scripting capabilities and enabling operation across Windows, Linux, and macOS, bringing unprecedented convenience to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;powershell-7-a-powerful-cross-platform-tool&#34;&gt;PowerShell 7: A Powerful Cross-Platform Tool
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;cross-platform-features&#34;&gt;Cross-platform features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 removes platform limitations, allowing users to utilize a single tool for enterprise-level server management on Windows, system administration in Linux environments, or everyday development tasks on macOS. This significantly improves work efficiency and reduces learning costs and operational complexity caused by platform differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;powerful-features&#34;&gt;Powerful features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It features robust scripting capabilities, supporting object-oriented programming, functions, and modules. With PowerShell 7, users can easily manage the file system (creating, deleting, copying, moving files and folders), access and modify the registry for in-depth system configuration, and manage processes and services for effective monitoring and control. Furthermore, PowerShell 7 integrates with various Windows and non-Windows technologies, such as user and permission management in Active Directory and resource provisioning and management on Azure cloud platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-source-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Open-source ecosystem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 is open-source, enabling global developers and enthusiasts to actively participate in its development and improvement. A wealth of open-source modules and tools are constantly emerging, enriching PowerShell 7&amp;rsquo;s functionality and applications. Users can find suitable modules within the open-source community to extend PowerShell 7’s capabilities or contribute their own code to advance the entire community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compatibility-and-stability&#34;&gt;Compatibility and Stability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 introduces numerous new features and improvements while maintaining compatibility with older PowerShell versions. These enhancements boost performance, increase stability, and allow users to complete tasks more smoothly, reducing interruptions due to software issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-command-line-prediction-view&#34;&gt;Open command-line prediction view
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among PowerShell 7&amp;rsquo;s many useful features, the &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; command is a practical tool that enhances the user’s command-line experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without enabling the command, inline auto-completion is available. Enabling it provides predictive suggestions in a list format, allowing users to select options with arrow keys, improving accuracy and efficiency of command input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.ttf248.life/p/powershell-7-persisting-settings-command-line-prediction-view/20250207222546.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-make-commands-persistent&#34;&gt;How to make commands persistent
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure a command takes effect each time PowerShell starts, you can add it to the PowerShell profile. The PowerShell profile is a special script that automatically executes its commands when PowerShell launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;confirm-configuration-file-path&#34;&gt;Confirm configuration file path
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In PowerShell, we can use the &lt;code&gt;$_&lt;/code&gt; variable to view the configuration file path. If the file does not exist at that path, the user can create it manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;echo $PROFILE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-configuration-file&#34;&gt;Open configuration file
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open the file corresponding to the configuration file path obtained through the &lt;code&gt;__INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/code&gt; variable using a text editor, such as the powerful Notepad++ or the lightweight Visual Studio Code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-command&#34;&gt;Add command
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; command to the open configuration file. Ensure the command is written accurately to guarantee it takes effect when the configuration file is executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;save-configuration-file&#34;&gt;Save configuration file
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adding the command, save the configuration file and close the text editor. The configuration file now includes the commands we want to execute each time PowerShell starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;verification-settings&#34;&gt;Verification Settings
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the current PowerShell window and restart it. In the newly launched PowerShell, when entering commands, the command-line input prediction view should display in a list format, indicating that our settings have taken effect successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these steps, we not only gained a deeper understanding of PowerShell 7&amp;rsquo;s powerful features and capabilities but also learned how to enhance the user experience by setting command-line input prediction views and ensuring these settings persist. We hope this knowledge helps you use PowerShell 7 more confidently and efficiently to complete various system management and automation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DeepSeek unexpectedly surged before the Spring Festival, causing Nvidia stock to plummet: Institutional maneuvering and large model reasoning chains</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-drop-institutional-operations-large-language-model-chain/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:36:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-drop-institutional-operations-large-language-model-chain/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the Spring Festival, DeepSeek quickly became a hot topic, garnering widespread attention on social media in just a few days. This sudden surge not only surprised many but also triggered a market chain reaction. Simultaneously, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock plummeted, raising concerns about its future and prompting significant short-selling activity from some institutions, suggesting a potentially orchestrated scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is an AI-powered tool focused on optimizing deep learning models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and image generation. In the days leading up to Chinese New Year, the project unexpectedly gained significant attention from investors and technical professionals. The team&amp;rsquo;s performance and demonstrated technological achievements have sparked considerable interest. Discussions about DeepSeek dominate tech circles across developer communities and social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s sudden surge in popularity wasn&amp;rsquo;t accidental. Analysis suggests potential involvement from certain institutions. Notably, Nvidia’s stock price has since seen a clear decline, indicating some factors are driving this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-1&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, a leading manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs), has long been a key hardware provider for large language models and AI computing. While the company&amp;rsquo;s stock has consistently performed strongly alongside the rapid growth of the AI market, it recently experienced a sharp decline following DeepSeek’s surge in popularity and increased market attention to its technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon may involve short-selling strategies by institutional investors. In recent years, as AI technology has become widespread, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock price has been highly inflated, leading many investors to believe its valuation is overhyped. Particularly after the surge in popularity of DeepSeek, some institutions may have profited handsomely by shorting Nvidia’s stock. These institutions successfully capitalized on precise market timing and an understanding of DeepSeek’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-2&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In traditional AI applications, many practitioners and investors focus on the &amp;ldquo;results&amp;rdquo; of AI models—such as generated images or text. However, discussions surrounding DeepSeek reveal a growing recognition that the underlying reasoning chain behind large language models is the more valuable core element. Previously, we could only see model outputs; now, we need to understand their logic, algorithms, and how to optimize performance by adjusting these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in thinking represents a deeper consideration of AI research and application. Moving from simple &amp;ldquo;black box&amp;rdquo; operations to genuinely understanding the internal workings of models is prompting many technical experts and investors to re-evaluate the future direction of artificial intelligence. DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s popularity exemplifies this breakthrough, encouraging attention towards the entire model construction and optimization process, rather than just the final output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-3&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s sudden rise, Nvidia’s stock plunge, and the market manipulation behind it all appear to be part of a carefully orchestrated scheme. A deep understanding of large language model thinking chains reveals that applying AI technology isn&amp;rsquo;t just about superficial accumulation; it requires in-depth exploration and optimization of internal model logic. As technology advances, we may see more innovative tools like DeepSeek emerge, driving AI research and application to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon not only reveals the immense potential of AI technology but also prompts us to consider the underlying business competition and capital operations. The future market trends will be a continued focus of this interplay between technology and capital.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Is Modern Monetary Theory the future of global economies?</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/modern-monetary-theory-future-global-economy/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 23:16:34 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/modern-monetary-theory-future-global-economy/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The US stock market&amp;rsquo;s ongoing bull run, aside from America’s inherent strength, is largely due to excessive liquidity in the dollar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern monetary system, following the [period indicated by BOLD_0], has gradually become a key theoretical underpinning for many economies worldwide. Its main characteristic is an emphasis on the active role of government intervention in markets, utilizing government fiscal deficits as a primary tool to achieve full employment while stabilizing inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keynesian economics. It emphasizes the government&amp;rsquo;s role in cyclical fluctuations, such as suppressing during overheating and stimulating during contractions, with a strong focus on the multiplier effect of government spending – how much consumption is stimulated by each dollar spent. Government spending of one dollar increases income for businesses and individuals by one dollar, leading to expanded production, job creation, and increased consumer spending to counteract economic contraction. It also maintains relatively conservative fiscal deficit limits and sustainability. Economic recovery will boost government revenue, particularly in suppressing overheating cycles, allowing the accumulation of stimulus resources for future periods, such as government debt potential and interest rate levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern monetary system is an extension of extreme Keynesianism, but with a key difference: the limitation on government debt. Central banks should not be independent; their primary goal is to address resource and productivity-constrained inflation—that is, increasing purchasing power in the market through unlimited fiscal deficits as technological advancements boost production efficiency until full employment and production bottlenecks are reached. Further increases in money supply will then lead to inflation, at which point controlling the upper limit of the fiscal deficit becomes necessary. As long as there is idle productive capacity, increased deficits will not cause inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-the-financial-crisis&#34;&gt;After the financial crisis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reality is not an ideal world. The selective application of Keynesianism, with its emphasis on stimulating economic downturns while inadequately curbing overheating, often leads to political gains. This creates a cycle where poor economic performance and overheating are both seen as achievements, making it difficult to implement corrective measures. Consequently, numerous economic problems arise, potentially leading to financial crises not unlike those caused by traditional overcapacity. The 2008 global financial crisis was essentially the result of market self-reinforcement under extreme Keynesian policies, creating a proliferation of shadow banking products—such as real estate and derivatives based on real estate assets. Even before the crisis, there was insufficient risk awareness across academia, government, and the markets, with debt-fueled prosperity being mistaken for achievement and benefiting many, particularly the financial system: they profited from losses while distributing dividends, ultimately leaving participants to bear the gains of previous stages—and often facing bankruptcy—with no possibility of returning funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow of the modern monetary system emerges after the financial crisis, characterized by rapid expansion and so-called emergency lending policies. The central bank acts as a lender of last resort, providing unlimited liquidity, while governments can continuously accumulate debt. Coordinated policy between the central bank and fiscal authorities sees the central bank supporting government deficits through bond purchases, ensuring policy consistency. This blurring of lines between monetary and fiscal policy relies heavily on direct central bank participation in purchasing government bonds – printing money with one hand and spending it with the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Eurozone and the United States exhibit similar trends. In 2008, EU government debt was approximately €6.7 trillion, with a leverage ratio of around 66%, slightly above the generally accepted warning line of 60%. By 2014, during the 5-year bailout period, debt reached €9.5 trillion and leverage rose to 93%. The US is even more extreme; in 2008, US government debt was around $10 trillion, reaching approximately $18 trillion by 2014. Recently, the debt ceiling was again raised, typically accompanied by threats of government shutdowns, but each time exceeding the limit. Debt currently surpasses $36 trillion, a $26 trillion increase compared to 2008. Considering GDP growth, government leverage has risen from 60% to over 120%. The Federal Reserve, as lender of last resort, played a crucial role in multiple bailouts and is also a major purchaser of government debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;drawbacks-and-limitations-of-the-modern-monetary-system&#34;&gt;Drawbacks and Limitations of the Modern Monetary System
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This government-led economic stimulus plan, though not a planned economy, faces consistent problems. How can you guarantee the omniscience of the market and the selfless dedication of all participants? Take a simple example: if a government department increases its budget by one million, will it go to a leader&amp;rsquo;s nephew or to the more cost-effective bidding process? In reality, interests are channeled in more complex ways, resulting in uncontrollable spending despite the government expanding debt and expenditures. The recent controversy surrounding the establishment of a US government efficiency agency is an extension of this issue. These issues vary in their manifestation across different economies with corruption indices, but we&amp;rsquo;re primarily discussing the underlying universal problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;inflationary-issues&#34;&gt;Inflationary issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the development of modern information networks, governments now possess far greater access to market information than in the past. However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t equate to omniscience; the market is inherently variable and constantly shifts due to expectations, creating a self-reinforcing structure. I anticipated your anticipation. Consider the actual performance: while Modern Monetary Theory showed promise between 2008 and 2020, achieving short-term economic recovery and inflation stability (even leading to deflation in the Eurozone and keeping US inflation within the expected 1-3% range), it fostered a belief akin to past faith in Keynesianism—a trust in an increasingly extreme tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, the primary reason is that manufacturing in developing countries continued to show high growth after 2008. Countries like China, which solidified its global production position during this period, and emerging economies in Southeast Asia and India, maintained substantial manufacturing value-added, effectively offsetting the limitations of Modern Monetary Theory – specifically resource constraints – and enabling relatively stable inflation even as Western nations faced deindustrialization, financial excess, rising government debt, and increased money supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after 2020, with the implementation of larger-scale stimulus policies, both the Eurozone and the United States experienced significant inflation, peaking around 10%. Even today, nearly three years into interest rate hikes, the U.S. labor market continues to show excessive heat, and financial markets have seen an unsustainable boom decoupled from economic growth. As base effects fade, U.S. inflation is heading towards 3% again. This overheating during a period of rising rates is closely linked to fiscal deficits. Rate hikes represent monetary policy contraction while fiscal policy remains expansive; the massive money supply in 2020 has made U.S. inflation stubbornly persistent. High inflation is the primary limitation of Modern Monetary Theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;government-debt-issue&#34;&gt;Government debt issue
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In principle, the government can theoretically use debt to repay debt without limits, but this requires a central bank&amp;rsquo;s willingness, that is, a lender of last resort within the modern monetary system. The Federal Reserve clearly isn’t prepared to grant the government such complete freedom; combined with decades of accumulated government debt balances, particularly interest expenses, high interest rates and increasing debt have gradually become a massive fiscal burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fiscal year 2023: U.S. federal revenue was $4.439 trillion, with interest payments on debt accounting for roughly 15% of that revenue. This high-interest trend continued in 2024, according to data released by the U.S. Treasury Department.
For fiscal year 2024, the U.S. federal government&amp;rsquo;s budget deficit reached $1.833 trillion, with net interest payments on debt totaling $882 billion – approximately 18% of U.S. federal revenue, exceeding Social Security expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the sustainability issue of fiscal policy. If low interest rates and low inflation are maintained for a long time, along with high debt (like Japan), it can indeed create an application of modern monetary theory over the long term. According to the Rule of 72, as long as interest rates are sufficiently low, incremental borrowing under a debt-funded system is very slow. With a 1% cost of funds, pure debt financing can double the debt in 72 years. If inflation disrupts this delicate balance, the accumulation of interest payments on the debt through compounding can lead to an uncontrollable trajectory for future debt; the principal becomes secondary. These issues will become even more acute if the central bank&amp;rsquo;s actions are inconsistent with the ruling party’s goals. The political agenda of the Trump administration sharply contrasted with the current hawkish stance of the Federal Reserve, which is a major source of tension in the relationship between the US government and the Fed during this term. What people are most concerned about is whether the current chairman can successfully reach the end of his term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;financial-bubbles-and-monetary-credit-issues&#34;&gt;Financial bubbles and monetary credit issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, government spending increases would flow to households and businesses, prompting broader investment and consumption that boosts effective demand. However, having experienced numerous financial bubbles since 2000, people now exhibit a strong preference for investment over consumption, especially when high-growth products emerge. They flock to financial markets seeking appreciation, even at the expense of quality of life and increased leverage—a pattern seen in periods of rapid growth for real estate in Japan, the US, and China. Combined with policy stimulus and practitioners pursuing their own interests, this often leads to subprime lending issues and many so-called &amp;ldquo;rescue&amp;rdquo; policies that essentially encourage debt accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History consistently shows that when monetary and fiscal policies are aggressively implemented, a bubble forms first, followed by wealth redistribution. This leads to the economic Ponzi scheme problem (Minsky moment) inherent in extreme Keynesianism or prolonged Modern Monetary Theory – as long as there&amp;rsquo;s hot money, asset prices continue to rise, attracting new investors; meanwhile, CPI measuring basic living expenses changes little, and capital stagnates in specific sectors. Eventually, newcomers find themselves unable to sustain the flow, leading to a Minsky moment judgment that invariably proves accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, currency itself is subject to supply and demand. When market supply exceeds the capacity of traditional investment assets, or when excessive harvesting fails to attract capital—such as repeated collapses in real estate bubbles (something Japanese have avoided for decades)—and tax policies suppress speculation, including increasing taxes on property ownership to reduce speculative demand, these measures increase the cost of financial speculation. In a situation where currency supply is excessive, the market urgently needs &lt;strong&gt;new investment assets&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to the emergence of various virtual investments—even attracting involvement from the U.S. President and First Lady. Some say it&amp;rsquo;s poaching dollars, but in reality, it’s likely an inevitable consequence of global monetary over-issuance and financial churning undermining fiat currency credibility. Even the credit-based status of modern money theory, reliant on state monopoly rights, may be challenged—the type of environment breeds what kind of financial games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) and Keynesianism share a progressive and substitutional relationship. MMT places greater emphasis on government intervention in the market and adopts a more radical stance towards fiscal deficits and central bank independence. While Keynesian policies led to stagflation and financial crises, MMT quietly took over after 2008, benefiting from continued productivity gains during globalization. It achieved rapid growth and maintained inflation levels in the short term but accumulated substantial government debt and financial bubbles. With rising inflation and conflicting goals between central banks and governments, high interest rates and leverage exacerbated the fiscal burden of servicing debt, significantly weakening fiscal sustainability. Excessive government involvement in monetary supply fueled financial bubbles and eroded the credibility of currency – the strength of the dollar is largely due to the relative weakness of others. This created fertile ground for new financial investment and speculative instruments, some even evading traditional tax limitations. This mirrors the global economy as a whole. MMT may not be the future; it&amp;rsquo;s more like a relic from 2008. Coupled with reverse globalization, the greater the past financial bubbles, government debt accumulation, and reckless speculation, the higher the risk of a hard landing – encompassing economic and social risks. Whether Keynesianism or MMT, regardless of how much money is supplied, it cannot fundamentally address wealth distribution issues; instead, it exacerbates risks within asset bubbles and Ponzi schemes. People repeatedly fall into the same trap in different ways, yet fail to learn from their mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Monitoring Linux System Metrics with atop: A Complete Guide to Installation, Configuration, and Usage</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/using-atop-to-monitor-linux-system-metrics-installation-configuration-and-usage-guide/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 22:48:55 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/using-atop-to-monitor-linux-system-metrics-installation-configuration-and-usage-guide/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Real-time and comprehensive monitoring of system resources and process status is crucial in Linux system maintenance. The atop tool, as a powerful monitoring utility, can help us achieve this goal easily. This article will detail how to install, configure, and use the atop monitoring tool on a Linux instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-atop-tool&#34;&gt;Introduction to atop tool
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atop is a tool dedicated to monitoring Linux system resources and processes. It records system and process activity, reporting on the status of all running processes. Data collected includes resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, network) and process states, which can be saved as log files. For each process, we obtain key information such as CPU utilization, memory growth, disk usage, priority, username, status, and exit code. Furthermore, through the Atop configuration file, users can customize parameters like logging frequency, storage path, and rotation policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-atop-tool&#34;&gt;Installing atop tool
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installation methods for atop vary slightly across different Linux distributions; the following explanation uses a common operating system as an example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba Cloud Linux 3/2、CentOS 7/8、Fedora、Rocky Linux 9&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute installation command:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start atop service:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu / Debian&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update software source list:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute installation command:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start atop service:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CentOS Stream 9&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start atop service:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;openSUSE&lt;/strong&gt;：&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute installation command:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start atop service:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-operations&#34;&gt;Other Operations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To generate an atop index log file daily, you can do the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust monitoring cycle, log retention time, and log storage path as needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the daily log rotation service and enable it to start automatically at boot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the business has more complex requirements for log processing, it can be combined with logrotate or custom scripts to implement log management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If network usage monitoring is required, you can install the netatop module (which is not installed by default in atop). For example, using Alibaba Cloud Linux 3 system:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the kernel development package and software environment required for compilation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the latest version of netatop source code to the designated directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unzip the source code and enter the source directory: &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and install modules and daemons from source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start netatop service:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atop tool is powerful and flexible. With proper installation, configuration, and usage, we can better understand the status of a Linux system, promptly identify and resolve potential issues. We hope this article helps everyone improve their Linux system monitoring skills.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding buy rate and sell rate in exchange rates</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-exchange-rates-buy-and-sell-rates/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 22:32:10 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-exchange-rates-buy-and-sell-rates/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the foreign exchange market, particularly at banks or currency exchange points, we often see terms like &amp;ldquo;buy rate&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sell rate.&amp;rdquo; Many people may not be clear on these concepts, or even confuse them. Today, we will use a simple example to help everyone understand the meaning and function of these rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-buy-rate-and-sell-rate&#34;&gt;What are &amp;ldquo;buy rate&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sell rate&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks or currency exchange institutions are willing to buy foreign currency at this rate; that is, when you sell foreign currency (like US dollars) to a bank, the bank will pay you in RMB according to the buying rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks or currency exchange institutions are willing to sell foreign currency at this rate; that is, when you buy foreign currency with RMB, the bank will sell it to you at the selling rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exchange rate at which the bank buys foreign currency from you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The price the bank offers you for foreign currency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that banks&amp;rsquo; buying and selling exchange rates are typically different, with the selling rate generally higher than the buying rate. This difference is how banks make a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-study-analysis&#34;&gt;Case Study Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help everyone better understand the practical application of these exchange rates, let&amp;rsquo;s take a specific example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you go to a bank to exchange for US dollars, and the bank&amp;rsquo;s exchange rate is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 US dollar = 7.0 Chinese yuan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 US dollar = 7.2 Chinese yuan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-1-you-sell-us-dollars-to-a-bank&#34;&gt;Scenario 1: You sell US dollars to a bank
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have $1,000 and want to sell it to a bank, the bank will calculate using its buy rate&lt;/p&gt;
\[
$1,000 USD x 7.0 CNY/USD = 7,000 CNY
\]
&lt;p&gt;That means the bank will give you 7,000 RMB. The exchange rate is &lt;strong&gt;买入汇率&lt;/strong&gt;, as you are selling dollars to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-2-you-buy-us-dollars-with-rmb&#34;&gt;Scenario 2: You buy US dollars with RMB
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have 7,000 RMB and want to exchange it for US dollars, the bank will calculate using the selling rate:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
$972.22 USD
\]
&lt;p&gt;In this case, 7000 RMB can be exchanged for approximately 972.22 USD. The exchange rate is &lt;strong&gt;卖出汇率&lt;/strong&gt;, as you are purchasing dollars from a bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-the-buy-rate-different-from-the-sell-rate&#34;&gt;Why is the buy rate different from the sell rate?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that the bank&amp;rsquo;s selling exchange rate (7.2 RMB/USD) is higher than its buying exchange rate (7.0 RMB/USD). This is because banks typically profit from foreign exchange transactions by exploiting this difference. In other words, banks make a profit by charging a higher selling rate and paying a lower buying rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the above case, the bank&amp;rsquo;s spread is:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
Selling exchange rate (7.2) - Buying exchange rate (7.0) = 0.2 RMB
\]
&lt;p&gt;This difference is the bank&amp;rsquo;s source of profit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bank buys foreign currency from you at this exchange rate (the rate when you sell foreign currency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bank sells foreign currency to you at this exchange rate (the rate when you buy foreign currency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between the buying and selling exchange rates is the bank&amp;rsquo;s profit margin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these exchange rate concepts allows us to better know how much foreign currency we will receive or how much Chinese Yuan is needed to purchase it when exchanging currencies. Hopefully, this simple example helps everyone better understand the basic principles of foreign exchange rates!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Loading mismatched PDB files in Visual Studio</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-loading-unmatched-pdb-files/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 20:04:33 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/visual-studio-loading-unmatched-pdb-files/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When debugging a program in Visual Studio on Windows, if the PDB file doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the executable, you’ll receive a &amp;ldquo;Failed to load symbol file&amp;rdquo; error. Program crashes and resulting dump files will also fail to allow smooth entry into the crash scene if the PDB is mismatched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-pdb-file&#34;&gt;What is a pdb file?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDB files are debugging information files created by Microsoft, used for program debugging. They contain information such as symbol tables, source file names, and line numbers. PDB files are generated during compilation to aid in debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;debugging-with-windbg&#34;&gt;Debugging with WinDbg
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WinDbg is a debugging tool from Microsoft that can be used to debug Windows programs. WinDbg can load mismatched PDB files, but requires manual loading. The __INLINE_CODE_0 command can force the loading of mismatched PDB files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, WinDbg is less convenient than Visual Studio, so we want Visual Studio to also load mismatched PDB files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio-loading-mismatched-pdb-file&#34;&gt;Visual Studio loading mismatched PDB file
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source code is now typically managed using Git, allowing you to easily find corresponding versions, recompile them, and generate the associated PDB files. Why can&amp;rsquo;t they be loaded? Primarily due to metadata mismatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small tool can modify metadata, generate a new PDB file based on executable information, allowing Visual Studio to load it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download address for chkmatch: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.debuginfo.com/tools/chkmatch.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.debuginfo.com/tools/chkmatch.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site cache address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;chkmatch.zip&#34; &gt;chkmatch.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;ChkMatch utility can be used to check whether an executable and debug information file match. It can also be used to enforce matching between an executable and debug information file, if they are compatible.

For more information about debug information matching and related issues, see this article.

Supported debug information formats: DBG, PDB 2.0, PDB 7.0.

chkmatch [-c ExeFile DebugInfoFile ] |
         [-m ExeFile DebugInfoFile]
-c
Check matching between the executable and the debug information file.
-m
Make the executable and the debug information file match.
ExeFile
The name of the executable file.
DebugInfoFile
The name of the debug information file.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Cursor AI programming IDE trial</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/cursor-ai-programming-ide-trial/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 19:30:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/cursor-ai-programming-ide-trial/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Another year has passed. The biggest change at work is the noticeably increased involvement of AI. Previously, switching between different development languages required developers to be familiar with various APIs. Now, these basic code snippets can be generated by AI – a great boon for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chatgpt&#34;&gt;ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2023, I revised two introductory articles. Now it&amp;rsquo;s 2025, and frankly, there hasn’t been a significant improvement. It still requires developing one&amp;rsquo;s own understanding, being able to reasonably break down tasks, and most importantly, identifying bugs in AI-generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-copilot&#34;&gt;Github copilot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t recall the exact date, but I saw information stating that Singapore has deployed servers for domestic use. This means we no longer need to constantly use a VPN; only a VPN is required for login, after which it can be turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Github Copilot more often; this plugin can be used directly in VS Code and Visual Studio without switching between programs. Compared to ChatGPT, Github Copilot offers better project support and a friendlier interface. You can feed it portions of local files &lt;strong&gt;to generate code that aligns with your project.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cursor-ai&#34;&gt;Cursor AI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently saw a new AI programming IDE, Cursor AI. This IDE is based on GitHub Copilot, but it&amp;rsquo;s even more intelligent and can help you create files directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels pretty good after a quick try, but my understanding of the existing project is still not enough. When dealing with many local project files and large-scale refactoring and optimization, I still need &lt;strong&gt;开发者拆分任务&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switch to curso&amp;rsquo;s engineering mode, enter: Create a personal resume webpage with support for multiple style switching. Remember to fill in some personal information for data display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few tries, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to get the following webpage. Of course, it’s still quite simple, but it’s pretty good for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, registered users can enjoy 150 free trials of the premium API; paid users are limited to 5000 calls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are! Just paste the text here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>C&#43;&#43; Bitwise Operations Fundamentals: Bit Extraction and Flag Setting</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-bitwise-operations-basics-flags/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 02:23:56 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-bitwise-operations-basics-flags/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In practical C++ development, bitwise operations are a common technique, particularly when handling system states, flags, or control bits. This article will explain how to use bitwise operations to get and set specific flag bits through an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;basic-operating-concepts&#34;&gt;Basic operating concepts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In computers, data is stored as binary digits (bits) of 0 and 1. Bitwise operations are operations performed on these bits. C++ has several common bitwise operators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks if a bit is 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sets a specific bit to 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used to invert a bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverse all bits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift all bits several positions to the left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift all bits right by several positions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we need to perform a series of bit operations on a &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;italicized&lt;/em&gt; value to represent different states using various flag bits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mermaid&#34;&gt;flowchart LR
    A[原始数值: 00010000] --&amp;gt; B[左移: 00010000 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1]
    B --&amp;gt; C[结果: 00100000]
    C --&amp;gt; D[右移: 00100000 &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1]
    D --&amp;gt; E[结果: 00010000]

    subgraph 左移操作
        direction LR
        A --&amp;gt; B --&amp;gt; C
    end

    subgraph 右移操作
        direction LR
        C --&amp;gt; D --&amp;gt; E
    end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirements-analysis&#34;&gt;Requirements Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the description in the question, we have a 16-bit flag used to represent different states. These states are represented by various binary bits, each corresponding to a specific meaning. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether it failed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it compressed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incremental?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a follow-up package?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal request or logout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;implement-using-bitwise-operations&#34;&gt;Implement using bitwise operations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will use bit operations to set and get these flag bits. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the value of a single bit (0 or 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a bit to 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a bit to 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first define a flag to store these flags. Then, we use bit operations to check and set the corresponding flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;c-example-code&#34;&gt;C++ example code
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;bitset&amp;gt;

// 定义标志位常量
const unsigned short BIT_0_FAIL = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 0;    // bit0 是否失败
const unsigned short BIT_1_COMPRESSED = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1; // bit1 是否压缩
const unsigned short BIT_2_INCREMENT = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2;  // bit2 是否增量
const unsigned short BIT_3_HAS_MORE = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 3;   // bit3 是否有后续包
const unsigned short BIT_5_CANCEL = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 5;     // bit5 正常请求(0)或注销(1)

// 检查某一位是否为1
bool isBitSet(unsigned short wInfo, unsigned short bitMask) {
    return (wInfo &amp;amp; bitMask) != 0;
}

// 设置某一位为1
void setBit(unsigned short&amp;amp; wInfo, unsigned short bitMask) {
    wInfo |= bitMask;
}

// 清除某一位（设置为0）
void clearBit(unsigned short&amp;amp; wInfo, unsigned short bitMask) {
    wInfo &amp;amp;= ~bitMask;
}

int main() {
    // 假设wInfo的初始值为0
    unsigned short wInfo = 0;

    // 设置bit0（失败标志）
    setBit(wInfo, BIT_0_FAIL);
    
    // 设置bit1（压缩标志）
    setBit(wInfo, BIT_1_COMPRESSED);
    
    // 打印wInfo的二进制值
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;wInfo (in binary): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::bitset&amp;lt;16&amp;gt;(wInfo) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

    // 检查各个标志位
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit0 (是否失败): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_0_FAIL) ? &amp;quot;是&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;否&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit1 (是否压缩): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_1_COMPRESSED) ? &amp;quot;是&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;否&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit2 (是否增量): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_2_INCREMENT) ? &amp;quot;是&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;否&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit3 (是否有后续包): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_3_HAS_MORE) ? &amp;quot;是&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;否&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;bit5 (是否注销): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (isBitSet(wInfo, BIT_5_CANCEL) ? &amp;quot;是&amp;quot; : &amp;quot;否&amp;quot;) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

    // 清除bit1（压缩标志）
    clearBit(wInfo, BIT_1_COMPRESSED);
    
    // 打印更新后的wInfo
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Updated wInfo (in binary): &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::bitset&amp;lt;16&amp;gt;(wInfo) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run code, recommended by an old friend: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wandbox.org/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://wandbox.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;wInfo (in binary): 0000000000000011
bit0 (是否失败): 是
bit1 (是否压缩): 是
bit2 (是否增量): 否
bit3 (是否有后续包): 否
bit5 (是否注销): 否
Updated wInfo (in binary): 0000000000000001
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;code-explanation&#34;&gt;Code explanation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using bitwise operations (shifting, ANDing, ORing, XORing, etc.), we assign each flag a unique binary position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bolded and italicized elements are not part of the translation. Here&amp;rsquo;s the translation: It is a matter of great importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the specific flag bit to 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set a specific flag bit to 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bit manipulation allows for efficient handling of multiple status flags. This technique is particularly useful in practical development, such as embedded systems, network protocols, and system state management, where bit flags are often used to represent multiple binary states, saving space and improving efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post aims to help you understand how to use bitwise operations in C++ for bit manipulation and setting. Mastering these skills is very helpful for writing efficient and maintainable code!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Upgraded desktop PC to a 2.5G network card, accelerating local area network connections</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The desktop hardware upgrades continue – we mentioned the PCIe adapter for solid-state drives in a previous article. Where did the old SSDs go? They weren&amp;rsquo;t wasted; they were removed and installed in the new computer I bought (a year ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new machine has impressive hardware specs: 2.5G dual network ports, PCIe 4.0, and WiFi 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently moved, and the room lacks a dedicated router for networking. Devices connect via wireless network. The ASUS motherboard desktop&amp;rsquo;s wireless card performance is lacking, possibly due to router wireless access or slow upload speeds between local networks, resulting in poor speed between machines. A new 2.5G NIC was purchased and installed in the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;network-instructions&#34;&gt;Network Instructions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machines still use the original wireless network cards for internet access, but are directly connected with a network cable. Both ends have 2.5G network cards. How to connect them via Ethernet is widely documented online; remember to disable firewalls and designate one machine as the gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mermaid&#34;&gt;graph TD;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from the previous discussion, I encountered an issue where the wireless network card was not being recognized. Before rebuilding the partitions, I also researched other solutions online, such as removing the motherboard battery and disconnecting power for fifteen minutes; or upgrading to the latest BIOS driver—but all of these proved problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking there were still things to deal with, I switched to a limited network and ran the ethernet cable from the living room to the room. Then the problem reappeared – the wired network wasn&amp;rsquo;t recognized either. I tried a drastic measure: reinstalling the system, which resulted in a missing partition error. If this had been happening consistently, I wouldn’t have bothered troubleshooting for so long. This ASUS disk conflict seems intermittent and triggered by unstable system restarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, a new disk was added to the desktop – a 2TB solid-state drive from Yangtze Memory (YMTC), M.2 interface. The machine hasn&amp;rsquo;t been restarted since then until it was shut down yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reinstall-system&#34;&gt;Reinstall system
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been two years since I last reinstalled the system. The C drive is full, and Windows has its usual issues – various software likes to store things on the C drive. So, I decided to reinstall the system. After reinstalling, the network card issue was resolved, and I restored my development environment the next day. Just as I was preparing a system backup, a new problem arose: the boot partition is missing after restarting the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the steps from the previous article, I rebuilt the boot partition, but it&amp;rsquo;s unstable. It might not load after a reboot. I initially suspected issues with the case, then checked the hard drive cable connections several times, but everything seems fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;memory-revival&#34;&gt;Memory revival
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, this machine had an SSD installed using a PCIe adapter (plugged into the graphics card slot) instead of directly connecting it to the motherboard. This time, installing it directly on the motherboard might indicate a motherboard issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;motherboard-manual&#34;&gt;Motherboard manual
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motherboard manual contains an error: the labeled SATA port locations do not match the actual locations. With multiple disks installed in all available ports (many of which are older SSDs using SATA), and according to the manual, there&amp;rsquo;s a conflict between these ports. Testing revealed this conflict is triggered intermittently, causing the affected disk to fail to load. This is problematic as it’s the system disk with the boot files, resulting in boot failures.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Unveiling the Secrets of ESP Partition, GPT Partition Table, and the Windows Operating Systems Collaboration</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/exploring-esp-gpt-and-windows-cooperation/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, after work, I got home and turned on my desktop. The system booted normally, but the wireless network card failed to load. Thinking the card might be loose, I opened the case and reinstalled it. This made things much worse; now the system won&amp;rsquo;t boot at all, and the bootloader has failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I worked with desktop computers, so partitioning feels a bit unfamiliar. I used DisGenius to create a new blank partition (usually at the beginning of the disk) and allocated it as an ESP partition (defaulting to 300M). Then, I rebuilt the boot from within the PE system. Relevant information can be found online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of computer storage, ESP partitions, GPT partition tables, and Windows operating systems are closely linked, each playing a unique and crucial role in supporting stable system operation and efficient management. Before delving into them, however, it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to mention the &amp;ldquo;pioneer&amp;rdquo; in the history of computer partitioning – the MBR partition table format. It reflects the evolution of technology by contrasting with later innovations. Today, let’s explore their intrinsic connections and intricacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mbr-partition-table--the-foundation-of-traditional-disk-partitioning&#34;&gt;MBR Partition Table – The &amp;ldquo;Foundation&amp;rdquo; of Traditional Disk Partitioning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;MBR, short for Master Boot Record, has existed since the early days of personal computers and dominated the hard drive partitioning field for decades&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;basic-architecture&#34;&gt;Basic architecture
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is located in the first sector of the hard drive, also known as sector 0, and occupies 512 bytes. These 512 bytes are primarily divided into three parts: firstly, the boot program code, responsible for loading the operating system&amp;rsquo;s boot loader during computer startup, typically 446 bytes; secondly, the disk partition table, occupying 64 bytes, which can define up to 4 primary partition entries, each entry using 16 bytes to record parameters such as starting head, sector, cylinder, and partition type and size; finally, the last 2 bytes are the MBR termination flag &amp;ldquo;55 AA&amp;rdquo;, used to identify this sector as a valid MBR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;historical-achievements-and-limitations&#34;&gt;Historical achievements and limitations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the MBR partition table adequately met the relatively simple storage needs of personal computers. It allowed operating systems to smoothly recognize hard drive partitions for orderly data storage and retrieval. However, as technology evolved, its limitations became increasingly apparent. On one hand, constrained by a 64-byte partition table space, it could only support a maximum of four primary partitions; creating more required the use of extended and logical partitions, adding complexity to disk management. On the other hand, with a maximum capacity of only 2TB, it struggled to keep pace with today&amp;rsquo;s high-capacity drives—often several terabytes or even dozens—becoming a bottleneck for further storage technology development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;esp-partition--the-systems-invisible-boot-key&#34;&gt;ESP Partition – The System&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Invisible Boot Key&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESP, short for EFI System Partition, is a special partition required on computers using the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) standard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a computer powers on, the UEFI firmware first locates the ESP partition on the hard drive and reads the boot loader stored there (such as Windows Boot Manager), thereby initiating the operating system. It&amp;rsquo;s like a precise key that unlocks the gateway to system startup; without it, the system would be lost and confused at boot time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ESP partition also stores essential drivers needed during system startup, ensuring that hardware devices (such as disk controllers and graphics cards) function correctly in the early boot phase, laying the foundation for the subsequent operating system to take over smoothly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;space-requirements-and-format&#34;&gt;Space requirements and format
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, the ESP partition is recommended to be between 100MB and 500MB; allocating around 200MB usually suffices for basic needs. Its file system format must be FAT32 because UEFI firmware can only recognize this format for reading boot files, ensuring compatibility and cross-platform support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gpt-partition-table--the-smart-manager-of-your-hard-drive&#34;&gt;GPT Partition Table – The &amp;ldquo;Smart Manager&amp;rdquo; of Your Hard Drive
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT (GUID Partition Table), or Global Unique Identifier Partition Table, is a new partitioning scheme designed to replace traditional MBR partition tables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advantages-revealed&#34;&gt;Advantages revealed
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s era of data explosion, high-capacity hard drives are constantly emerging. The GPT partition table overcomes the 2TB capacity limitation of MBR and theoretically supports up to 9.4 ZB (Zettabytes) – an extremely large storage space enabling massive data storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike MBR, which limits partitioning to a maximum of four primary partitions, GPT allows for up to 128 partitions, providing users and system administrators with great flexibility—whether it&amp;rsquo;s dividing multiple system or data partitions, or reserving partitions for specific purposes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GPT partition table utilizes a redundant backup mechanism, storing partition information in both the hard drive header and tail. This allows the system to automatically recover from another backup if one partition table is damaged, significantly reducing the risk of data loss due to partition table failure and ensuring data security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;structural-analysis&#34;&gt;Structural Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GPT partition table consists of several parts, including a protective MBR (retained for BIOS compatibility but not used for actual partitioning), a GPT header (storing basic information about the partition table, such as version, number of partitions, and table size), and an array of partition entries (each entry detailing key information like start/end sectors, GUID type, and unique identifier). These structures work together to precisely plan and manage disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;windows-operating-system--a-digital-interaction-space-for-users&#34;&gt;Windows Operating System – A &amp;ldquo;Digital Interaction Space&amp;rdquo; for Users
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows, a widely used operating system worldwide, builds a user-friendly bridge between people and computer hardware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;integration-with-esp-partitions-and-gpt-partition-tables&#34;&gt;Integration with ESP partitions and GPT partition tables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Windows installation process on UEFI-based systems, the installer automatically creates an EFI System Partition (ESP) and deploys boot files to it. The hard drive is initialized with a GPT partition table, creating a system reserved partition (similar to the system boot file area in traditional BIOS), a Windows system partition (where core system files are installed), and other user-defined data partitions. Windows relies on the GPT partition table to accurately identify each partition, enabling smooth startup through the ESP, ensuring seamless integration for a fluid user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;system-management-and-optimization-foundation&#34;&gt;System management and optimization foundation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows leverages the advantages of GPT partition tables for disk management during operation. For example, the Disk Management tool can easily identify GPT partitions, allowing users to conveniently create, delete, format, and resize them – meeting diverse data storage needs at different stages. System updates, software installations, and other processes are also closely related to the partition layout; a well-planned partitioning scheme helps improve system performance and stability, reducing issues caused by insufficient disk space or partition confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practical-tips-maintenance-and-troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Practical Tips: Maintenance and Troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding their close relationship makes daily maintenance and troubleshooting much more systematic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disk-space-management&#34;&gt;Disk space management
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly check the ESP partition space to avoid issues caused by insufficient space due to excessive startup items or software installations, which can affect system boot. For data partitions under GPT, plan storage effectively and promptly clear unnecessary files to prevent full partitions from impacting system operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;troubleshoot-startup-issues&#34;&gt;Troubleshoot startup issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the system fails to boot, first check the ESP partition for corruption or missing files. You can use the UEFI firmware&amp;rsquo;s built-in startup repair tool or enter a Windows recovery environment using the installation media to rebuild the ESP partition’s boot files. If you suspect a GPT partition table failure, use professional disk tools (such as DiskGenius) to check the integrity of the partition table and attempt to repair/restore backup partition information to recover lost partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESP partitions, GPT partition tables, and the Windows operating system work like a precise team, each playing their part to create a stable and efficient computing environment. Understanding them not only helps us confidently install and maintain systems but also allows us to grasp the underlying logic of computers and navigate the digital world with ease. Reflecting on the rise and fall of the MBR partition table further highlights the power of technological progress, which drives storage technology forward to meet ever-increasing data storage demands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Understanding GCC, GLIBC, and C&#43;&#43; Program Compatibility Issues</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/deep-understanding-gcc-glibc-cpp-compatibility-issues/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 19:51:16 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/deep-understanding-gcc-glibc-cpp-compatibility-issues/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In C++ development, GCC and GLIBC are essential components, and compatibility issues after program release often trouble developers. This article will delve into their nature, explore the root causes of compatibility problems, and discuss corresponding solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-gcc-a-powerful-compiler-foundation&#34;&gt;I. GCC: A Powerful Compiler Foundation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection, is an open-source compiler suite developed by the GNU project. It&amp;rsquo;s far more than a typical compiler; it supports numerous mainstream languages including C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, and Go, providing a one-stop solution for cross-language development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking C++ as an example, when we write a source file containing complex features such as classes, templates, and function overloading, GCC can convert the high-level C++ code into instruction sequences that the underlying machine can understand and execute, based on C++&amp;rsquo;s strict syntax and semantic rules. This process involves multiple fine-grained stages including lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCC first preprocesses the source file. During this process, it handles all directives, and after preprocessing, the source file is initially expanded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After preprocessing, the file enters the compilation stage. GCC, based on the C++ language standard, converts the source file into assembly code. It carefully checks the code structure, ensuring correct class inheritance, polymorphism implementation, and function call parameter matching. If any errors violating syntax or semantics are detected, it will promptly report them and terminate the compilation process. For example, if there is a mismatch between the function declaration and definition&amp;rsquo;s parameter list, GCC will precisely indicate the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The assembler converts the assembly code generated in the previous step into machine code, producing a target file with a &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; extension. These target files contain binary instructions that can be directly executed by the machine, but they cannot run independently because a complete program typically consists of multiple modules with unresolved function and variable references.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the final sprint to generate an executable file. The linker integrates multiple object files and required library files (static or dynamic libraries). For example, when using container classes from the C++ Standard Template Library, the linker needs to find the corresponding library implementation code to ensure that functions like __INLINE_CODE_0__BOLD_3&lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; can be correctly called at runtime, ultimately generating a complete executable program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-glibc-the-backbone-behind-c-program-execution&#34;&gt;II. GLIBC: The Backbone Behind C++ Program Execution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GLIBC, or the GNU C Library, is a specific implementation of the C standard library within the GNU ecosystem. Although its name highlights C, C++ programs are equally reliant on it, as C++ inherits much from C&amp;rsquo;s foundation. It provides a vast array of fundamental functions, such as those for memory management, and frequently appears in early C++ development and scenarios demanding high performance and conciseness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GLIBC acts as a crucial bridge between the operating system and applications. In Linux systems, when a C++ program makes a system call—for example, to open a file (using a function that relies on GLIBC implementation)—GLIBC encapsulates the program&amp;rsquo;s request in the manner specified by the operating system kernel, passes it to the kernel, and returns the result to the application after the kernel has processed it. This allows applications to use various system resources—such as file systems, networks, and process management—without needing to understand the complex details of the underlying system call interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;compatibility-issues-after-c-program-release&#34;&gt;Compatibility Issues After C++ Program Release
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different Linux distributions often use different versions of GLIBC. When a C++ program is compiled in a high-version GLIBC environment, it may inadvertently utilize new functions or rely on optimized implementations introduced in that version. For example, newer GLIBC versions improve memory allocation algorithms, and programs frequently leverage these improvements for performance gains. If such a program is ported to a system with an older GLIBC version, it may encounter missing function errors (because the function wasn&amp;rsquo;t introduced in the older version) or abnormal function behavior (due to discrepancies between old and new implementations), leading to crashes or incorrect results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when using the same GCC compiler, different versions exhibit variations in code generation, standard library support, and implementation details of C++ features. Newer GCC versions may offer complete support for the latest C++ standards (e.g., modules and coroutines in C++20). Compiling programs utilizing these advanced features with older GCC versions can result in errors due to unrecognized syntax; even without syntactic errors, differing optimization strategies across GCC versions can lead to significantly different machine code performance—affecting execution efficiency and memory usage—potentially causing vastly different behavior in demanding scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++ programs may need to run on different hardware architectures, such as x86, ARM, and PowerPC. These architectures have their own unique instruction sets, memory layouts, and data alignment requirements. For example, a structure&amp;rsquo;s data storage layout that runs correctly on the x86 architecture can cause abnormal memory access and program errors on the ARM architecture due to different alignment rules. Furthermore, GCC generates significantly different machine code when compiling for different architectures; if the program contains hardcoded architecture-specific instructions or assumptions, cross-architecture runtime failures are inevitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strategies-for-addressing-compatibility-issues&#34;&gt;Strategies for Addressing Compatibility Issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using a static library, which packages the program&amp;rsquo;s dependencies (e.g., GLIBC) directly into the executable file. This eliminates runtime dependency on specific GLIBC versions, effectively preventing issues caused by version mismatches. However, static linking significantly increases the executable size and requires weighing the pros and cons in scenarios with limited storage resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By leveraging containerization technologies like Docker, the C++ program and its required runtime environment (including specific versions of GCC, GLIBC, etc.) are encapsulated within a standalone container. This ensures consistent execution environments regardless of the underlying operating system, simplifying cross-environment deployment significantly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a comprehensive compatibility testing system covering various GLIBC versions, GCC versions, and common system architectures. Through continuous integration tools, conduct regular automated testing in multiple environments during development. Address any compatibility issues promptly to eliminate potential risks early on and ensure stability upon release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoroughly understanding the workings of GCC and GLIBC, accurately identifying the root causes of C++ compatibility issues, and skillfully applying solutions are essential skills for every C++ developer aiming to build robust, cross-platform applications. Only then can our C++ works navigate diverse technical ecosystems smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Docker domestic image proxy failure</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/docker-domestic-mirror-failure/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 18:29:25 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Deploying Docker on domestic servers. If the company doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide an image registry, developers must first configure a domestic mirror acceleration address. Today, I configured a mirror acceleration address on a server, but it consistently fails to pull images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting-and-repair-attempts&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting and Repair Attempts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, I attempted to switch to an alternative mirror address hoping to resolve the issue, but it proved ineffective; the problem persists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, I began modifying the local DNS configuration, attempting to find a breakthrough at the network resolution level; unfortunately, after some debugging, the fault persisted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local network&amp;rsquo;s stability is now questionable, so I switched to my phone’s hotspot to bypass potential issues. However, the problem persists unchanged – a frustrating result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problems-spreading&#34;&gt;Problems spreading
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have several servers available, all with Docker environments installed. Attempting to pull images from them proved unsuccessful; the error messages were identical across all devices, indicating a systemic issue rather than a problem with a single server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further investigation revealed that the mirror proxy appeared to have failed instantly. Switching quickly to an overseas machine proved successful, and thankfully, image pulling resumed normally. This suggests the issue likely lies within the domestic network link or related configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strategic-adjustment-circumventing-solutions&#34;&gt;Strategic adjustment: Circumventing solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome obstacles in accessing domestic images, and with foreign mirrors accessible, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided on a workaround to expedite project progress. We will first switch to a foreign server to pull the necessary images, then push them to a domestic mirror repository, effectively creating a &amp;ldquo;data bridge.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Dockerfile was modified to replace the image address with one suitable for domestic environments, and the image was rebuilt and successfully deployed&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The End of the Era of Wild Capitalism: The League of Legends Esports Era Concludes</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-era-league-of-legends-esports/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The esports industry has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, becoming a significant cultural phenomenon worldwide. Games like League of Legends (LOL) have not only provided players with competitive entertainment but also fueled capital investment, driving the development of various esports platforms and events. However, this trajectory is now entering a gradual decline alongside the influx of capital and the rise of the pan-entertainment industry. The rise and fall of Panda TV, as well as the competition between Douyu and Huya, mark the end of an era of &amp;ldquo;wild capitalism,&amp;rdquo; suggesting shifts in the favorable conditions for the esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-investment&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Investment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early esports industry had humble beginnings, particularly in China. Many players participated in competitions for games like StarCraft and Dota fueled by their passion. However, esports truly began to rise with the release and promotion of League of Legends. After League of Legends officially entered the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche community into part of mainstream culture. Especially starting in 2013, the LPL (Chinese professional league) steadily developed, making League of Legends the cornerstone of China&amp;rsquo;s esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 marked a turning point for the esports industry in China. The influx of capital transformed esports from simple competitions into a much larger ecosystem. Panda TV, as one example, became a product of excess capital. Founded with investment from Wang Sicong, Panda TV rapidly gained popularity by attracting viewers and users with its innovative content and substantial investments. However, this also exemplified the &amp;ldquo;barbaric&amp;rdquo; influx of capital – a relentless pursuit that often lacks patience and long-term vision. While significant short-term achievements were made through considerable financial and human resources, Panda TV ultimately declared bankruptcy in 2019 due to management issues and overreliance on capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fall of Panda TV did not lead to a decline in the esports streaming industry, but rather spurred the rise of platforms like Douyu and Huya. These two giants quickly became leaders in the esports sector, with increasingly fierce competition between them. Douyu initially gained prominence through livestreaming League of Legends professional matches and signing top streamers, setting a benchmark for esports broadcasting. Huya, by increasing investment in esports events and diversifying its platform, gradually narrowed the gap with Douyu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital played a significant role in this process. Bilibili successfully went public in 2018, and Huya also conducted an IPO that same year. The rapid flow of capital led to high industry concentration and intense competition between platforms for streamers and copyrights, resulting in a &amp;ldquo;capital war.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-convergence-of-pan-entertainment-and-esports&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Convergence of Pan-Entertainment and Esports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With increased investment in the esports industry, esports platforms are gradually diversifying their content. Esports hosts are expanding beyond game commentary and event streaming to include various entertainment formats such as singing, dancing, and interactive live streams. This has resulted in a richer content ecosystem centered around esports but incorporating diverse entertainment elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the trend towards broad entertainment has brought problems—the originally focused gaming culture of esports is gradually being marginalized, replaced by a trend prioritizing entertainment above all else. This shift has caused some viewers who were deeply passionate about esports culture to feel alienated, and capital is increasingly turning its attention to other entertainment sectors. Excessive investment and profit-seeking are blurring the essence of the esports industry, weakening the core value proposition centered on competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rise of short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and other pan-entertainment industries, capital has gradually shifted funds from esports to broader entertainment content. Consequently, giants like Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance are no longer solely reliant on esports projects for profit but have increased investment in areas such as film, music, and short videos. Notably, ByteDance&amp;rsquo;s rise, fueled by the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin, has overshadowed esports’ prominence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-league-of-legends-generational-shift-the-fading-era-of-dividends&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: League of Legends&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Generational Shift&amp;rdquo;: The Fading Era of Dividends
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since League of Legends entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has become synonymous with the esports industry, fostering countless professional players, teams, and events, and driving a massive esports ecosystem. However, over a decade later, as a leading project in Chinese esports, League of Legends is entering a stage of generational transition. Notably, its influence has been gradually declining in recent years, even showing signs of significant decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
The most noticeable change is a generational shift in the player base. Initially, esports&amp;rsquo; rapid growth was fueled by a large cohort of young players, many of whom became professional players or viewers thanks to League of Legends. This generation grew up during a period of &amp;ldquo;demographic dividend,&amp;rdquo; immersed in the game’s competitive appeal and driving industry expansion. However, as time passed, these players matured, entered society, and shifted their focus towards other aspects of life and careers. Simultaneously, younger generations show less enthusiasm for League of Legends, resulting in an evident age gap and declining interest within the esports audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
Despite numerous updates and revisions, League of Legends&amp;rsquo; content innovation is struggling to keep pace. Annual version updates, hero balance adjustments, and the introduction of new gameplay features have failed to fundamentally address players’ need for novelty. Simultaneously, the MOBA market is becoming saturated, and other game genres like Honor of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite have rapidly gained popularity, diverting a significant number of players away from League of Legends. This competitive landscape has left League of Legends perpetually in a “chaser” role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-what-is-the-future-of-the-esports-industry&#34;&gt;Conclusion: What is the future of the esports industry?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The esports industry is like a skyscraper that seemingly sprung up overnight. Excessive capital wanders within the internet sector, seeking the next opportunity, and esports has become one of their targets. Leveraging China&amp;rsquo;s demographic dividend, the industry achieved rapid success, but this success lacks a solid foundation. Over-investment in capital, talent shortages, and weak game content are all hindering healthy development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before college, I didn&amp;rsquo;t play many games. League of Legends accompanied a generation’s growth; I watched so many finals. As an outsider, comparing Chinese and Korean players—especially Faker—Chinese players always felt hesitant during major tournaments. I understand the psychological pressure on players, but after more than ten years of development in this industry, mental health should be prioritized by teams. However, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been, and gameplay still relies on players’ innate talent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>From Games to Family: Why We Gradually Drift Away from Virtual Worlds as We Grow Up</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:11:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What were the happiest times playing games – sneaking to play Tank Battle, Super Mario, and Contra on our family&amp;rsquo;s TV as a child, or secretly playing Age of Empires on our family’s computer with my cousin, or later in college, playing Devil May Cry and League of Legends with my roommates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childhood had no worries, and when you played, you were completely absorbed in it – a level of immersion that&amp;rsquo;s impossible to find again as an adult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As times change and society progresses, we who were once active in virtual worlds are gradually realizing that the game platform filled with joy and competition seems to be drifting away from our lives. The disconnection of game social links, accompanied by players&amp;rsquo; gradual departure, is not only due to technological advancements and the replacement of games themselves, but also because of a shift in our life’s focus. As we grow older, we become busy with marriage and having children, and the main thread of life gradually shifts from personal entertainment to family responsibilities. Today, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss the underlying reasons behind this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disappearance-of-gaming-socialization-a-tug-of-war-between-virtual-and-real-worlds&#34;&gt;The Disappearance of Gaming Socialization: A Tug-of-War Between Virtual and Real Worlds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many, games weren&amp;rsquo;t just entertainment during their youth; they were a social outlet. Popular online multiplayer games offered challenges and competition while connecting players worldwide, creating virtual communities. Playing dungeons and team battles with friends was part of life back then, as were late-night voice chats and sharing daily experiences – memories we cherish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with time, more and more players have found that this virtual social experience lacks lasting appeal. As games are updated and new platforms emerge, players increasingly find more interactive ways to socialize outside of gaming. In-game friendships gradually fade from view, and many previously active social connections within the game eventually dissolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;games-and-responsibility-a-shift-in-lifes-focus-after-adulthood&#34;&gt;Games and Responsibility: A Shift in Life&amp;rsquo;s Focus After Adulthood
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entering adulthood, responsibilities gradually increase. Many young people once invested significant time in games, but with the start of their careers or shared living/family formation, these previously essential leisure activities are squeezed by life&amp;rsquo;s obligations. Marriage, having children, and even caring for parents – these major responsibilities require choices regarding energy and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming has become a thing of the past, replaced by the prioritization of family life. Many young people who once &amp;ldquo;struggled&amp;rdquo; in games are gradually realizing that real-life is the most important matter. Especially after having children, the focus of their lives shifts completely to family, and gaming is pushed to the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-games-to-family-how-changes-in-life-affect-our-entertainment-choices&#34;&gt;From Games to Family: How Changes in Life Affect Our Entertainment Choices
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our life experiences, family is one of the most important components. Once entering family life, time and energy become more specific and limited. To care for children and spend time with their partners, many young parents find they no longer have enough time to focus on games they once loved. Sometimes, they even lose interest in game updates and new releases. Gradually, social media platforms and offline interactions with friends and family become the preferred way for many people to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we’ve completely abandoned entertainment, but rather chosen ways more suitable for our current life stage. Many friends who used to connect through games may now maintain contact via other means—family gatherings, meals together, or short trips—due to diverging life paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;farewell-to-the-virtual-world-how-do-we-view-this-shift&#34;&gt;Farewell to the virtual world: How do we view this shift?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many who once immersed themselves in gaming, saying goodbye to game-related social connections isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. That virtual world, which brought us joy and a sense of accomplishment, has become part of our memories. However, farewell doesn’t mean severing ties completely; it means making different choices as life changes, balancing our roles in the real world. As we mature from youthful boys to responsible adults, while games still hold value, they can no longer be the main theme of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this shift reflects a facet of human adaptability—our ability to adjust our focus and lifestyle according to different stages. When responsibilities and family become central to life, gaming socialization is no longer a priority but rather an occasional pastime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-games-may-usher-in-another-wave-of-sense-of-belonging&#34;&gt;Future games: may usher in another wave of &amp;ldquo;sense of belonging.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, with social development and technological advancements, the forms and content of games are constantly evolving. For example, modern online multiplayer games are increasingly moving towards more relaxed and flexible approaches, and some even prioritize family interaction and parent-child relationships. In the future, we may see more game formats that better integrate into family life and provide players with healthier, more balanced social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as many people still feel nostalgia and passion when talking about &amp;ldquo;childhood games,&amp;rdquo; perhaps we, in the future, will also unexpectedly revisit those past games, bringing new understanding and experience, and re-enter that virtual world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-is-changing-but-love-remains&#34;&gt;Life is changing, but love remains
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s games or family, life’s changes consistently accompany our growth. We gradually realize that while virtual worlds offer endless joy and excitement, we ultimately return to reality, to the warmest place – home. There’s no need to regret leaving games, as each stage of life has its own unique meaning. These changes are what make us more complete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Hong Kong Stock Exchange, History of Cryptocurrency Development</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-stock-exchange-virtual-currency-history/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:00:28 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-stock-exchange-virtual-currency-history/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s re-election as US President, virtual currency has once again entered the public consciousness. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) has also been actively developing related businesses; here’s a brief overview of HKEX&amp;rsquo;s virtual currency development history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the contract details, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that futures were initially introduced, which is reasonable given their better liquidity and ease of attracting institutional investors. The subsequent introduction of spot ETFs was also logical, as ETFs are a more readily accepted investment tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cryptocurrency-list&#34;&gt;Cryptocurrency List
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Stock Exchange&amp;rsquo;s market data doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a tag to distinguish whether a contract is for virtual currency, but it can be determined by the contract name. The official transaction list does provide corresponding subcategories &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.hkex.com.hk/Market-Data/Securities-Prices/Exchange-Traded-Products?sc_lang=en&amp;amp;asset=virtualasset&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;december-16-2022&#34;&gt;December 16, 2022
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;hong-kong-exchange-welcomes-first-asia-based-crypto-etfs-listing&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Exchange Welcomes First Asia-Based Crypto ETFs Listing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) today (Friday) welcomed the listing of Asia’s first cryptocurrency ETFs, further expanding its product ecosystem and providing more choices for Hong Kong and international investors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new ETFs launched today — China Southern East Funds Management’s Bitcoin Futures ETF (stock code: 3066) and Ethereum Futures ETF (stock code: 3068) — are managed by China Southern East Asset Management Co., Ltd. They track standardized, cash-settled Bitcoin futures contracts and Ethereum futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Chief Operating Officer and Co-Head of Markets, Nicole Yau, stated: &amp;ldquo;The two newly listed cryptocurrency ETFs add to Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s increasingly rich and diverse ecosystem of exchange-traded products. These new products will provide investors in Asia with their first opportunity to participate in digital asset investments, reflecting our focus on the digital economy and market demand. We look forward to welcoming more thematic ETFs and digital asset products in the coming months.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETFs are one of the fastest-growing businesses under Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, with a constantly expanding and increasingly diverse range of products. In 2022, this included the launch of its first Metaverse ETF, first carbon futures ETF, and first blockchain ETF, as well as the inclusion of ETFs in the Shanghai–Hong Kong Stock Connect scheme for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average daily turnover of Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), including ETFs and leveraged/inverse products, on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for the first eleven months of this year was HK$11.8 billion, a 50% increase from HK$7.8 billion in the same period last year, reflecting growing investor demand. As of November 2022, there were 168 ETPs listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with a total market capitalization of HK$373.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;april-30-2024&#34;&gt;April 30, 2024
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;hong-kong-exchange-welcomes-the-listing-of-the-first-spot-virtual-asset-etfs&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Exchange welcomes the listing of the first spot virtual asset ETFs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) today (Tuesday) welcomed the listing of Asia’s first spot virtual asset ETFs, expanding Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s product range and providing investors with greater choice, solidifying Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s position as a leading ETF market in Asia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Head of Securities Product Development Robert Lo said, &amp;ldquo;The newly launched virtual asset spot ETF will enrich Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s diverse and vibrant ETF market ecosystem, providing investors with investment opportunities in a new asset class. Following the successful launch of virtual asset futures ETFs a year ago, Asia’s first virtual asset spot ETFs will further enhance the variety and liquidity of products traded on Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing. We look forward to continuing to work closely with market participants to introduce more new products into our internationalized market.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor demand for the first batch of virtual asset futures ETFs launched in 2022 has been strong, with robust trading volume. The daily turnover of Hong Kong-listed virtual asset futures ETFs increased from HK$8.9 million in 2023 to HK$51.3 million in Q1 2024, accompanied by net inflows of HK$529 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange trading of products (including ETFs, leveraged and inverse products) is one of the fastest-growing markets on Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, with a continuously expanding range of product types. Sixteen new ETF products were added in 2023 and Q1 2024, including Asia’s first Saudi Arabia ETF and Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s first exchange-traded options ETFs. There are currently 179 ETFs listed in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;hong-kong-exchanges-and-clearing-is-launching-a-series-of-virtual-asset-indices&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing is launching a series of virtual asset indices
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) today (Monday) announced the launch of the HKEX Virtual Asset Index Series on November 15, 2024. This index series will provide a reliable benchmark for the rapidly growing asset class of virtual assets, supporting Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s development as Asia’s leading digital asset hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This index series will provide a transparent and reliable benchmark for the pricing of Bitcoin and Ethereum in Asian time zones, aiming to establish a unified reference price for virtual assets and resolve price discrepancies across global exchanges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing CEO Nicolas Aguzin said, &amp;ldquo;We are pleased to launch the Hong Kong Exchange Virtual Asset Index Series to meet regional demand for this rapidly growing asset class. By providing a transparent and reliable real-time benchmark, we aim to help investors make informed decisions, support the healthy development of the virtual asset ecosystem, and solidify Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s position as an international financial center.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of this index series is part of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing&amp;rsquo;s commitment to exploring emerging areas, supporting the development of Hong Kong’s financial technology while also providing investors with important benchmark tools and solutions in a constantly evolving market environment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index series will include reference indices for Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as reference exchange rates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference rate is calculated based on a weighted average of 24-hour trading volumes in Bitcoin or Ethereum, aggregated from major cryptocurrency exchanges and priced in USD. It&amp;rsquo;s designed for the settlement of financial products and calculated daily at 4:00 PM Hong Kong time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This index series will be the first in Hong Kong to comply with EU Benchmark Regulation (BMR), co-managed and calculated by a UK-registered benchmark administrator and virtual asset data and index provider, CCData&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government issued a policy statement in 2022 aiming to foster a vibrant virtual asset industry and ecosystem in Hong Kong. The launch of the Hong Kong Exchange’s Virtual Asset Index series will help increase public understanding of virtual asset investment trends by providing real-time data and daily reference prices in the Asian time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further details regarding the design and calculation methods of the index series will be released as appropriate&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fees have been reduced, fees have been reduced – several large domestic ETFs have lowered their fees</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/reduced-fees-large-domestic-etf/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 03:08:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/reduced-fees-large-domestic-etf/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Huatai Pioneer has lowered the all-in fee rate for its CSI 300 ETF and similar products to the lowest tier among comparable ETFs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better meet the investment and financial management needs of investors, Huatai-Perrin Fund announced adjustments to the management fees and custody fees for its Huatai-Perrin CSI 300 ETF and related funds, revising relevant content in the fund contracts accordingly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading ETFs including ChinaAMC Huaxia Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 ETF, ChinaAMC CSI 50 ETF, NanShan Zhongxin 500 ETF, JIA SHI Huaxia Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 ETF, and Yifangda Growth Enterprise ETF have simultaneously announced reductions in management and custody fees, bringing rates down to 0.15% and 0.05%, respectively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most previous ETF fee reductions, this one was driven by proactive moves from large-scale products, and will likely have a significant impact on the industry. Exchange data shows that as of November 18th, the ChinaAMC Huatai 300 ETF has exceeded 370 billion yuan, making it the largest ETF currently available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of super ETFs has begun reducing fees, demonstrating a willingness to benefit investors and allowing them to invest in popular, liquid funds with higher value for money&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry experts believe that fee reductions for ETFs with economies of scale will help mutual funds fulfill their function of serving inclusive finance, benefiting a wider range of investors by reducing holding costs, increasing potential returns, and enhancing investment satisfaction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low fees also help enhance the product&amp;rsquo;s competitiveness. With liquidity attraction and cost advantages, it is expected to attract more long-term incremental capital, fostering a healthy &amp;ldquo;long money, long investment&amp;rdquo; ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, broad-based ETFs have become a primary channel for investors seeking entry with modest capital and long-term investment, thanks to their advantages such as flexible trading, high transparency, strong liquidity, and low investment thresholds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fee reduction could act as a catalyst, facilitating greater participation from long-term investors in A-shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My fixed-investment Tianhong fund hasn&amp;rsquo;t released an announcement yet, but it should follow suit. If there’s no update, I’ll need to consider switching funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original management fee was 0.5%, and the custody fee was 0.1%. The new fees are 0.15% for management, and 0.05% for custody. This is still a significant reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Increased scrutiny of third-party investment advisors; will those behind the TikTok stock trading scheme face repercussions?</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The sledgehammer is falling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokerage services, boosted by short videos, may be entering a period of rapid growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late September, following a surge in A-share market performance, Douyin&amp;rsquo;s stock recommendations received widespread attention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several financial commentators, including &amp;ldquo;Da Lan,&amp;rdquo; gained popularity on Douyin, indirectly causing some volatility in the capital market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of popular financial commentators is also supported by third-party investment advisory firms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to sources, many third-party investment advisory firms operate multiple accounts on short video platforms, using traffic strategies to attract viewers to watch their educational videos and boost enthusiasm for purchasing related investment advisory products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors suggest that a certain third-party investment advisory firm earned 1 billion yuan in revenue this October alone, exceeding its earnings for the entire first half of the year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &amp;ldquo;good times&amp;rdquo; are facing more uncertainties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since November, various departments have issued documents requiring securities service providers to strengthen compliance management of social media accounts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 15th evening, Tonghua Shun (300033.SZ) announced that its subsidiary was penalized by the securities regulatory commission for livestreaming activities involving implied stock recommendations
This could be signaling that regulators are tightening their oversight
The promotion of third-party investment advisory firms, including Nine Square Wisdom Investment (9636.HK), may face increased pressure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;close-monitoring&#34;&gt;Close monitoring
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of short video platforms like Douyin has amplified emotional expression and indirectly influenced trading behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data from Jullian Analytics, during the period of September 27th to October 8th, when transaction volume reached a new high, Douyin&amp;rsquo;s A-share keyword search index soared from 4.2384 million to 12.7786 million, more than doubling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actions of third-party investment advisors are attracting regulatory attention amid this situation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokerage employees recommending individual stocks during livestreams is a frequent violation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 8th, the Guangdong Securities Regulatory Bureau took regulatory measures to suspend the acceptance of new clients from a company due to instances of &amp;ldquo;suggesting stock recommendations&amp;rdquo; during its livestream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of November 14th, the Guangdong Securities and Futures Industry Association issued a notice titled &amp;ldquo;Inadequate Live Stream Control Results in Business Suspension,&amp;rdquo; directly pointing out that certain institutions with securities advisory qualifications had inadequate controls during live stream promotional activities, including recommending specific stocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live stock recommendations are prohibited. Live streaming falls under public media dissemination, and live streamers, regardless of whether they are registered securities investment advisors, are not permitted to recommend individual stocks during broadcasts. - Guangdong Securities &amp;amp; Futures Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an isolated case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, a penalty notice disclosed by the Shanghai Securities Regulatory Bureau also included one case involving illegal stock recommendations on social media platforms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation by regulators revealed that Wang Yong, an investment consultant at Haitun Securities Investment Consulting Co., Ltd. Shanghai Branch, published misleading video content on WeChat Video Number, which violated professional conduct guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Securities Regulatory Bureau took supervisory measures, issuing a warning letter to Wang Yong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to sources, some unqualified investment advisors who were recommending stocks on Douyin (TikTok) by affiliating with brokerages have been suspended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some individuals in the industry are doing livestreams on Douyin, operating under brokerage firms to obtain investment consultant qualifications. They then use these livestreams to attract customers and sell investment consultant product packages offline. However, they were suspended after being caught recommending specific stocks during a livestream. Reputable brokerages typically only discuss sector conditions in their educational livestreams, but avoid mentioning individual stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, regulators are closely monitoring illegal stock recommendations on social media&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Shenzhen Securities Regulatory Bureau has notified that some institutions or individuals within the industry have been found to be engaging in illegal stock recommendations and other violations through self-media. To further regulate the operation and management of securities investment consulting agencies&amp;rsquo; self-media within its jurisdiction, each agency should strengthen their own self-media operations management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may bring more challenges to the promotion of third-party wealth management services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;traffic-businesses-are-illegal&#34;&gt;Traffic businesses are illegal
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether investors lured into the market by short videos have made money remains to be seen, but as &amp;ldquo;water sellers,&amp;rdquo; third-party investment advisory firms are already seeing their value rise in the secondary market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a leading player in online investment education, Jiufang Intelligent Investment&amp;rsquo;s market capitalization has surged from 287.8 million yuan in early September to 1.2464 billion yuan as of the close on November 13th, representing a gain of 333.08% over 49 trading days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mid-year report shows that in the first half of this year, Jiufang Zhi Tou conducted brand exposure on social media platforms like Douyin and Xiaohongshu, reaching 488 accounts and 0.46 billion followers by the end of June&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &amp;ldquo;Hong Bangzhu&amp;rdquo; (Mr. Hong), as Chief Investment Consultant for Jiufang Zhito, has 2.26 million followers on Douyin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We focus on MCN operations, prioritizing users and collaboratively driving the comprehensive development of traffic, brand, and product. Jiu Fang Zhi Tou notes that by deeply integrating new media tools like live streaming and short videos, leveraging AI technology to build fan networks, and actively exploring e-commerce models, we can effectively achieve efficient conversion of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiufang Zhitu&amp;rsquo;s advisory courses range in price from several thousand to over ten thousand yuan. Their most expensive package, &amp;ldquo;Super Investor,&amp;rdquo; is priced at 139,600 yuan/six months and includes exclusive insights and private advisor services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Jiumfang Intelligence Investment&amp;rsquo;s advisory products have a refund rate exceeding 10%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2024, the refund rates for Jiu Fang Zhi Tou&amp;rsquo;s flagship series and Qinyulong series were 14.7% and 18.5%, respectively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Jiufang Intelligent Investment&amp;rsquo;s business expansion will be affected remains to be seen amidst regulatory scrutiny&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent media reports indicate that accounts under third-party investment advisors like Jiufang Zhi Tou have been affected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, media reported that &amp;ldquo;Hong Tou&amp;rdquo; was suspended from streaming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 15th, TradeWind01 searched for the account and found that appointments for the livestream on November 18th were still available on &amp;ldquo;Hong Gangzhu&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; live broadcast page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market news also indicates that regulatory authorities have inspected Jufeng Intelligent Investment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources close to Nine Square Exit confirmed to TradeWind01 (ID:TradeWind01) that the inspection was a routine check and has concluded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only company recently rumored to be caught up in this round of regulatory scrutiny&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports indicate that Tonghua Shun is under investigation for alleged illegal stock recommendations, potentially leading to a suspension of its business operations
Tonghua Shun responded on November 15th, stating that &amp;ldquo;there is no illegal stock recommendation situation and there has been no investigation.&amp;rdquo;
That evening, however, Tonghua Shun announced that its subsidiary, Zhejiang Tonghuashun Cloud Software Co., Ltd., was penalized by the Zhejiang Securities Regulatory Bureau with a three-month suspension of acquiring new clients due to inadequate compliance management during live streaming promotions and instances of implied stock recommendations
This may also indicate that regulatory bodies are increasing their scrutiny of stock recommendations on platforms like Douyin Live&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, short video platforms are also attracting investment firms, but their involvement is currently limited by regulatory requirements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A source from a securities firm told TradeWind (ID: TradeWind01) that the company is exploring short video operations and traffic acquisition methods, and has even sent personnel to learn from short video platform companies. However, due to compliance requirements, it remains in the exploratory phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, regulatory compliance requirements stem from the emotional nature of short video platform content, while investment requires a rational approach – a conflict inherent in their natures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allowing emotions to influence the capital market can easily trigger sharp fluctuations, which is detrimental to its long-term healthy development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How securities firms can navigate the rise of short videos while avoiding regulatory breaches remains a challenging question for all parties involved&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;An upstream open-source development platform prior to release
First noticed the open-source operating system lifecycle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s expired, what&amp;rsquo;s the problem? Besides security issues, DNF isn&amp;rsquo;t working. I noticed it failed when I recently installed a tool, and checking the mirror source revealed that it has expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-centos-stream&#34;&gt;Introduction to CentOS Stream
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;positioning-and-role&#34;&gt;Positioning and Role
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream sits between Fedora Linux (upstream development) and RHEL (downstream development), acting as a bridge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be seen as a version for experiencing the latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux features, suitable for early adopters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;birth-and-background&#34;&gt;Birth and Background
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time passed, Red Hat began seeking more effective ways to develop its enterprise-level Linux platform and launched CentOS Stream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After CentOS 8 reached its end-of-life in late 2021, CentOS Stream continued to receive updates as its successor and has become the future direction of the CentOS project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-and-advantages&#34;&gt;Features and Advantages
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream is a rolling-release Linux distribution offering faster updates. It provides greater transparency and opportunities for community, partner, and customer involvement, allowing users to contribute to Red Hat Enterprise Linux more quickly and directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of CentOS Stream is software that Red Hat intends to include in a future stable version of RHEL, providing a stable ABI/API for community members for development and testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-cases--target-users&#34;&gt;Use Cases &amp;amp; Target Users
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS Stream is suitable for CentOS users who want to continue receiving the latest Linux feature updates, as well as developers and partners who wish to participate in Red Hat Enterprise Linux development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also aims to help community members, Red Hat partners, and others fully leverage innovative open-source programs within a more stable and predictable Linux ecosystem&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Customizing Hugo Themes with Modules: An Explanation of Ideas</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/hugo-module-custom-theme-ideas/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:01:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/hugo-module-custom-theme-ideas/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The site has switched themes many times, with custom modifications made each time. Here&amp;rsquo;s a record of the ideas behind customizing my themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugos-modules&#34;&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Modules
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people think of modularity, they often consider things like Nginx modules or IDEA plugins. Typically, it allows me to meet my differentiated needs by uploading certain modules. The popularity of this approach stems from its flexibility – it easily satisfies individual requirements without much effort. Often, while the overall functionality is similar, there are always some subtle differences. This highlights the complexity of software, which includes not only technical complexities but also business complexities. Most often, we face business complexities. This perfectly illustrates the saying &amp;ldquo;like a mountain between different professions.&amp;rdquo; Nowadays, modularity isn&amp;rsquo;t just used in the internet industry; it’s adopted by finance and even traditional manufacturing to support enterprise production and management through information systems. Even for something as simple as a leave request system, companies within the same industry can have significant differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This module differs from what people typically expect—it&amp;rsquo;s not organized by function to meet diverse needs, but rather based on directory structure to identify common patterns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://medium.com/@sunwei.xyz/07-hugo%E6%9E%B6%E6%9E%84-hugo%E7%9A%84%E6%A8%A1%E5%9D%97-8ef5a520a822&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;07. Hugo架构 — Hugo的模块&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34;&gt;[[imports]]
path = &amp;quot;github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/v3&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method still works, but is not recommended in this article. If the theme has been updated, maintaining it will be more complicated and require a separate Git repository for management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-just-paste-the-text-here&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are! Just paste the text here.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a foundational understanding of modularity, grasping custom themes becomes much easier. Current themes are also assembled from multiple different modules; to modify one, simply locate the corresponding template file and make your changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracted from official documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this method, there won&amp;rsquo;t be any file under &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; directory. In order to modify the theme, you will have to copy the file you want to modify to the same directory under &lt;code&gt;layouts&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in order to modify the &lt;code&gt;themes/hugo-theme-stack/layouts/partials/head/custom.html&lt;/code&gt; file, you will have to copy it to &lt;code&gt;layouts/partials/head/custom.html&lt;/code&gt; and modify it there (copy the code from theme&amp;rsquo;s repository). The same applies to &lt;code&gt;assets&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; directories。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-the-template-file&#34;&gt;How to find the template file
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;orthodox-approach&#34;&gt;Orthodox approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examine the theme&amp;rsquo;s source files, understand its design, locate the relevant template files, and make your changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;brute-force-approach&#34;&gt;Brute force approach
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m not very familiar with front-end code, I sometimes use a brute-force approach: opening the relevant page in my browser, locating what needs modification, searching for it using &lt;code&gt;审查元素&lt;/code&gt;的方式，定位到__INLINE_CODE_1__ within the theme source code, finding the corresponding file, copying it to the site directory, and then making changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;little-tips&#34;&gt;Little tips
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform provides a default file for custom styling. We can split the modifications into multiple files and use &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; to import them, which allows for better style management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.ttf248.life/p/hugo-module-custom-theme-ideas/image.png&#34;
	width=&#34;141&#34;
	height=&#34;375&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;alt text&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;37&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;90px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-of-changes-6h&#34;&gt;Summary of Changes (6h)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything is easily manageable now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall: Global text style, maintains the display style of previous &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt; 融合 &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_1&lt;/strong&gt;, and is friendly to Chinese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homepage: Add mouse interaction animation to the right navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homepage: Article summaries added (implementation was quick, using a shortcut method)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrollbar: Styled the appearance of the scrollbar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The code highlighting plugin &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; has been introduced to style code blocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partial content is reprinted; original author and link information have been added&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive page: Remove the theme&amp;rsquo;s color overlay from the top category image, displaying the original image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive page: Added statistical display panel categorized by year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archive page: Two-column layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script uses custom special variables to achieve summary previews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, excessive code reuse can also be a problem, leading to changes in one area affecting others. Therefore, when modifying the theme, be sure to avoid disrupting existing logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>County-level Brahmin: Big Shots in Small Towns</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:02:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, Teacher Da Bing has become very popular on Douyin. You often see accounts sharing clips from her livestreams. During one livestream, a listener asked, &amp;ldquo;Teacher Da Bing, I want to sell my house in Xi&amp;rsquo;an and return home to relax.&amp;rdquo; Da Bing replied, &amp;ldquo;At your age, in your thirties, you can’t just ‘lie flat.’ Your parents are aging, your children aren&amp;rsquo;t established yet, and even returning to your hometown, you’ll still have to deal with the complexities of a small county town.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether the view is right or wrong, what does this word mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many small county towns, people often talk about &amp;ldquo;county Brahmin&amp;rdquo; – their existence feels like a symbol of the local society. They are not necessarily religious figures or individuals with impressive titles, but rather seemingly ordinary yet influential people. They represent “power, status, and voice” in a small place, symbolizing a certain stratum within that county town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-1&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, we need to understand that &amp;ldquo;Brahmin&amp;rdquo; originally referred to the highest stratum of Indian society, representing wisdom, authority, and spiritual supremacy. However, in Chinese county towns, the term “county town Brahmin” lacks such complex religious connotations; it&amp;rsquo;s more a metaphor for a social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmin&amp;rdquo; refers to individuals who hold cultural authority within a county, such as teachers, doctors, prominent local merchants, and officials. Although their positions may seem ordinary, in the relatively closed environment of a county, they possess a comparatively high social status or, more accurately, considerable influence on local opinions and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-2&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the county town, almost every industry has these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins.&amp;rdquo; They might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Especially teachers with decades of experience in local areas, who may not be graduates of prestigious universities, but deeply understand how to build credibility through knowledge and are widely respected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Officials in county-level cities, such as deputy county commissioners and section chiefs, control certain resources and power. Despite their relatively low positions, due to the limited scope of their authority, they can become influential figures within their localities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owners in some county-level cities, though their businesses may not be large, hold considerable wealth and local influence. They might run a couple of well-known small enterprises and have significant sway within the county.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These individuals, though not prominent compared to elites or officials in big cities, hold a status almost equivalent to &amp;ldquo;cultural elders&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;power centers&amp;rdquo; within this small county-level society&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the meaning of &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins,&amp;rdquo; we must consider the unique environment of county towns. Here, information flows more slowly than in big cities, and social mobility is relatively fixed. These &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; often gain influence through long-term engagement with the locality, accumulating reputation, knowledge, and networks. They impact various aspects of local politics, economy, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In smaller areas, particularly where the education system may not be well-developed and ordinary people have limited choices, local &amp;ldquo;Brahmin&amp;rdquo; figures subtly shape the cultural atmosphere through knowledge imparted in classrooms, media explanations, and even social interactions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the limited population and resources in county-level towns, these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; are often key controllers of local resources. Their influence is pervasive, affecting everything from social welfare and policy implementation to project approvals. Their power of speech and decision-making allows them to hold a significant position within the local community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a relatively closed small society, interpersonal relationships are often crucial. These &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; control the flow of information and allocation of resources by establishing strong social networks, allowing them to play a decisive role at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; are often respected and revered, this elevated status is not without its problems. In modern society, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see that many of these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; in county towns may lack genuine ability and innovative spirit, instead maintaining their position through hereditary relationships and resource monopolies. With the development of informatization, their power is gradually being eroded, and new social mobility is beginning to reshape the landscape of small counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &amp;ldquo;County-Level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; is a fascinating social phenomenon that reflects the power and cultural structures within local societies. While their “power” may not directly threaten national governance, they are undoubtedly influential figures within their localities. In this era of rapid information flow and accelerating social change, these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; in county towns may be facing unprecedented challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Slow efficiency when processing large string data in Linux backend services</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/linux-backend-slow-string-processing/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:42:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/linux-backend-slow-string-processing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In past C++ development projects, we used a custom protocol for communication that employed a two-dimensional array structure. Due to inefficient traversal and serialization of this array when handling large amounts of data, the system experienced noticeable lag under high load, prompting feedback from the business department regarding these slowdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;issue-identification&#34;&gt;Issue identification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During troubleshooting, we first performed a performance analysis of the system. We found that CPU usage increased significantly and response times lengthened when processing large amounts of data. Analyzing system logs revealed numerous serialization operations, which were inefficient when handling two-dimensional arrays, leading to decreased system performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool&amp;rsquo;s thread analysis revealed that the logging thread spends most of its time string concatenation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key takeaway today is that different accumulation methods have vastly different efficiencies. Legacy code used the &lt;code&gt;__INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/code&gt; operator, which frequently creates temporary objects and is very inefficient—the kind of inefficiency you know is bad but don&amp;rsquo;t realize just how bad it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;demo-verification&#34;&gt;Demo verification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We extracted the business logic based on the project code and created a simple demo to verify the efficiency of string concatenation. We compared the efficiency while compiling and running it in &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; 下的 &lt;code&gt;vs2022&lt;/code&gt; 编译器，&lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_2&lt;/strong&gt; 下的 &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_3&lt;/strong&gt; 编译器，&lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_4&lt;/strong&gt; mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-points&#34;&gt;Key points
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project uses method four. Before receiving the test data, readers can first consider which approach is most efficient and which is least efficient. I was still surprised by the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concatenate each field directly into a string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using streams (concatenating) to join each field is more efficient, especially when dealing with large amounts of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-allocating sufficient memory for strings reduces the overhead of memory reallocation, thereby improving performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a new temporary string object for each concatenation degrades performance, especially during large-scale concatenations, as it involves repeated memory allocation and copying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the results, the project selected the least efficient method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the optimization efficiency of different platforms&amp;rsquo; compilers. Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s compiler falls short in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the code on different machines makes direct comparison of the data meaningless; instead, compare the differences between different concatenation methods&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lambda expression parameter lifetime in C&#43;&#43;</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-lambda-parameter-lifetime/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 19:23:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-lambda-parameter-lifetime/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In C++, lambda expressions are convenient anonymous functions that can capture external variables and use them internally. This makes lambdas a flexible programming tool. However, the lifecycle of lambda expression parameters is an aspect requiring special attention, particularly when capturing and passing arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lambda-expression-parameter-lifecycle&#34;&gt;Lambda expression parameter lifecycle
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lifetime of lambda expression parameters generally mirrors that of other C++ functions. Parameters exist during the function call and end when the call completes. However, due to potential capture of external variables, parameter lifetimes can also be affected by the capturing method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-relationship-between-capture-and-parameter-lifecycle&#34;&gt;The relationship between capture and parameter lifecycle
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;capturing-external-variables&#34;&gt;Capturing External Variables
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;C++ lambda expressions allow capturing external variables in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By value capture, the values of external variables are copied into the lambda, and the lifecycle of these copies is controlled by the lambda&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through capturing references, external variable references are preserved; lambda&amp;rsquo;s references point to the original external variables, and their lifecycle depends on the external variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;int x = 10;
auto lambda_by_value = [x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };  // 捕获x的副本
auto lambda_by_reference = [&amp;amp;x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };  // 捕获x的引用

lambda_by_value();  // 打印10
lambda_by_reference();  // 打印10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lifecycle of captured variables is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a variable is captured, its value is copied into the lambda; when the lambda&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle ends, this copy is destroyed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lambda functions hold references to external variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lambda-parameters&#34;&gt;Lambda Parameters
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lambda parameters are similar to regular function parameters, with a lifecycle limited to the lambda function body. They are created upon lambda invocation and terminate when the invocation is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;auto lambda = [](int a, int b) {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; a + b &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
};
lambda(5, 10);  // a和b在这里是lambda的参数
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;BOLD_2&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are the parameters of the lambda expression; they are created when the lambda is called and destroyed after it finishes executing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lifecycle-issues-when-capturing-external-variables&#34;&gt;Lifecycle issues when capturing external variables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;whether-captured-variables-are-valid-outside-of-the-lambda&#34;&gt;Whether captured variables are valid outside of the lambda
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if external variables are destroyed after a lambda call, the lambda internally still holds a copy of those variables. Therefore, the internal copy can be used safely, even if the external variables no longer exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;int x = 10;
auto lambda = [x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };
x = 20;  // x 在lambda调用后修改
lambda();  // 打印10，捕获的是x的副本
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a lambda captures a reference to an external variable, access to that reference within the lambda depends on the lifetime of the external variable. If the external variable is destroyed before the lambda executes, it can lead to a dangling reference and undefined behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;int x = 10;
auto lambda = [&amp;amp;x]() { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; };
x = 20;  // x 在lambda调用前修改
lambda();  // 打印20，捕获的是x的引用
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to ensure that captured external variables remain valid when the lambda is executed if the order of execution for lambdas is uncertain&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Installing Win11 Logitech G431 Headset Drivers</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 07:20:17 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Picking up where we left off, I came back to find an update for Ghub. It was a little exciting that the customer service issue of not being able to load properly seemed to be resolved. However, after a lot of troubleshooting – reinstalling and uninstalling – it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I contacted customer service for a solution, but was told an engineer could provide remote assistance. Unfortunately, their working hours are the same as mine, so I had to give up. Now I&amp;rsquo;m reviewing previous troubleshooting records and preparing to manually install the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-the-driver-installation-package&#34;&gt;Get the driver installation package
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can I obtain the driver files since Logitech doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide standalone driver installation packages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the system image installation package left over from the previous system reinstall, we can reinstall the system in a local virtual machine. In a clean environment, deploy Ghub separately, integrate the headset device into the virtual machine, locate the driver path, and copy it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related paths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\ProgramData\LGHUB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\logi_audio.inf_amd64_010b035044e24be4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;device-manager&#34;&gt;Device Manager
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is how to find the second path. Let&amp;rsquo;s briefly review how to manually manage driver files in Windows 11. This area covers two system-provided drivers and one from Logitech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second driver in the image is from Logitech. We analyze the current device drivers, searching all driver paths within the virtual machine. First, you need to find files starting with &amp;ldquo;logi,&amp;rdquo; then compare them. You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to locate the driver file; copy the entire folder and you’ll have the installation package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-driver&#34;&gt;Install driver
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While still in Device Manager, click &amp;ldquo;Update Driver,&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;Browse my computer for drivers.&amp;rdquo; This will take you to the following screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you open it, you&amp;rsquo;ll only see one drive – a standard USB drive. Choose &amp;ldquo;Install from disk&amp;rdquo; and select the folder we copied earlier. After installation, a Logitech-specific driver will appear in the dropdown list; switch the device driver to this newly installed one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anatomy-equipment-drivers&#34;&gt;Anatomy equipment drivers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drivers for this device are provided by the system. You only need to check if there&amp;rsquo;s an exclamation mark next to the driver; if so, enter the driver selection interface and switch to a different type of driver before switching back to restore normal functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;completed&#34;&gt;Completed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headphone microphone volume is back to normal, and the familiar ear monitoring function has returned&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Logitech headset driver installation failed</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;rsquo;t understand these things, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t waste hours troubleshooting; you would contact customer service immediately&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the C drive on my home desktop computer ran out of space. I allocated a 256GB SSD for it, but have been having issues with it frequently. Since moving to Shanghai, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with various matters, and finally found time last week to reinstall the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system reinstall went smoothly, and installing everyday software and setting up the development environment presented no issues. A few days later, intending to relax with some games, I realized the drivers for my mouse and headset weren&amp;rsquo;t installed yet. Both devices are Logitech, so I downloaded GHUB, which automatically recognized the hardware and installed the drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an unexpected issue occurred. The mouse driver installed smoothly, but the headset driver continuously displayed &amp;ldquo;Loading.&amp;rdquo; I suspect incompatibility between the latest version of Windows 11 and Logitech&amp;rsquo;s drivers caused the installation failure. I then began searching for information and attempting to manually install the driver, but the problem persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the translation: Simply put, what is the function of each device’s driver?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mouse driver mainly adjusts functions like movement speed. I rarely use macros; restoring previously saved parameters is sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The driver primarily functions for headphone monitoring, which is very useful during team voice communication as it allows me to hear my own voice. While the system&amp;rsquo;s microphone settings offer a similar feature, the driver implementation works better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite repeated attempts, the headphones&amp;rsquo; drivers consistently failed to load. Today, I finally thought to contact customer service for assistance and see if there was a solution. Customer service informed me that their servers have recently been experiencing issues, causing abnormal driver downloads. They are working on resolving this issue and advised me to wait until the next update when the problem should be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the headphone driver issue hasn&amp;rsquo;t been resolved yet, we at least know the cause, and hope it can be fixed soon&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abolish mortgage rate caps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting tomorrow, the housing fund interest rate will be lowered by 0.25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Down payment ratio reduced to 15%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$30 billion affordable housing refinancing loans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abolish-interest-rate-caps-on-first-time-and-second-home-mortgages-for-commercial-banks-nationwide&#34;&gt;Abolish interest rate caps on first-time and second home mortgages for commercial banks nationwide
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China (Shanghai Headquarters), branches in each province, autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government, and separately planned cities; all state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and all joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, adapt to the new changes in housing supply and demand and people&amp;rsquo;s expectations for quality housing, and promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, we hereby notify you of the following regarding adjustments to commercial personal housing loan interest rate policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliminate interest rate caps on first-time and second-home mortgages for commercial banks nationwide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China’s provincial branches, following a city-specific approach, are guiding local lending rate self-discipline mechanisms. They will independently determine whether to set lower limits on interest rates for commercial personal housing loans in each city within their jurisdictions, based on the real estate market conditions and local government regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking and financial institutions should determine the specific interest rate for each loan, considering factors such as their own operational status, customer risk profiles, and any applicable lower interest rate limits set by provincial market rate pricing self-discipline mechanisms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-housing-provident-fund-loan-interest-rates-have-been-reduced-by-025-percentage-points&#34;&gt;Personal housing provident fund loan interest rates have been reduced by 0.25 percentage points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Shanghai Head Office, branches in each province, autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government, and separately planned cities; policy-oriented banks, state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and various joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China has decided to lower the interest rates for individual housing provident fund loans starting May 18, 2024. Rates for first-time home buyers will be adjusted to 2.35% and 2.85% for loans with terms of 5 years or less (including 5 years) and over 5 years respectively. Second-time home buyer rates will be no lower than 2.775% and 3.325% for the same loan durations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;down-payment-ratio-adjusted-to-no-less-than-15&#34;&gt;Down payment ratio adjusted to no less than 15%
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China (Shanghai Headquarters), branches in each province, autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government, and separately planned cities; all regulatory bureaus of the National Financial Regulatory Administration; state-owned commercial banks; Postal Savings Bank of China; and joint-stock commercial banks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, adapt to the new changes in housing supply and demand and people&amp;rsquo;s expectations for quality homes, and promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, please note the following regarding personal mortgage policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For residential families purchasing a first home through loans, the minimum down payment for commercial personal housing loans is adjusted to no less than 15%. For second homes, it&amp;rsquo;s adjusted to no less than 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this foundation, each provincial branch of the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China and each sub-branch of the National Financial Regulatory Administration will independently determine the minimum down payment ratio for first-time and second-home commercial personal housing loans in their respective jurisdictions, in accordance with local government regulatory requirements and the principle of city-specific policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-central-bank-will-establish-a-rmb-300-billion-affordable-housing-refinancing-program&#34;&gt;The central bank will establish a RMB 300 billion affordable housing refinancing program
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 4 p.m., representatives from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, and the National Financial Regulatory Administration convened at a regular policy briefing held by the State Council to introduce supporting policies related to ensuring housing delivery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, Vice Governor of the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Yao Ling announced that the central bank will establish a RMB 300 billion affordable housing refinancing facility to support local state-owned enterprises in acquiring completed but unsold commercial properties at reasonable prices for use as rental or share ownership affordable housing, which is expected to stimulate RMB 500 billion in bank loans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the central bank, affordable housing lending has a one-year term with up to four extensions and an interest rate of 1.75%. It is directed towards 21 nationwide banks, encouraging them to provide loans to local state-owned enterprises selected by cities to acquire completed but unsold commercial properties for use as affordable housing. These acquisitions are strictly limited to existing, unsold commercial properties from real estate developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China will soon release a notice regarding establishing affordable housing refinancing loans&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Art of Balancing Bank Marketing Strategies with Personal Financial Management</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 01:33:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, home renovations have significantly increased our daily expenses. We typically use credit cards and pay them off within the billing cycle. Although we have sufficient cash on hand, we prefer to keep it in money market funds for extra interest income. At the same time, to ensure financial stability, we’ve set up automatic payments to promptly repay credit card bills upon due date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-status-deposits-increasing-loans-decreasing&#34;&gt;Bank status: Deposits increasing, loans decreasing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst growing economic uncertainty, people are more inclined to save rather than consume or invest. This leads to increased bank deposits but also requires banks to pay higher interest rates. Conversely, reduced consumption and investment activity lowers loan demand, making it difficult for banks to generate income through lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attract and retain customers, banks are compelled to offer more competitive deposit rates, further compressing their net interest margins. Simultaneously, to stimulate economic growth and consumption, the central bank may implement policies to lower benchmark interest rates, which will also affect loan rates and subsequently impact bank profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-marketing-strategies-cultivating-user-habits&#34;&gt;Bank marketing strategies: Cultivating user habits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repayment is approaching soon. First, Bank of Communications offered me a one-year interest-free installment plan. Shortly after, China Merchants Bank provided a 2.5% discount on installment interest, resulting in an annual rate of just 1.9%. Faced with these offers, I chose to accept the installment services from both banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are truly investing heavily to cultivate user habits. According to the definition of a bank&amp;rsquo;s revenue stream, I should be considered a valuable client. Given the current difficulty in lending, banks are essentially preparing for potential future financial difficulties on my part by fostering my installment mindset—allowing them to earn more interest income when that time comes. After all, credit card interest rates are well-known to be high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and laid the groundwork for future profits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-personal-financial-management&#34;&gt;The importance of personal financial management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While bank installment offers may seem appealing, users should recognize the risks of over-relying on credit card installments. We should carefully consider our repayment ability and future financial needs to avoid falling into long-term debt for short-term convenience. Key to personal finance management is balancing current needs with future planning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The multifaceted nature of games: A convergence of psychological development and social entertainment</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 15:07:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, gaming has evolved beyond a simple form of entertainment and become an integral part of daily life. From a psychological perspective, games play different roles in the mental development of people across various age groups and are closely linked to social interaction and recreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-state&#34;&gt;Mental state
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people are in a stage of exploring themselves and establishing their identity, therefore games can allow them to try on different roles and lives, satisfying curiosity and the desire for exploration. As they age, personal interests and values gradually stabilize, and games may no longer align with their life goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes&#34;&gt;Social attributes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, gaming has become a social activity, especially for young people. They make friends and build social networks through games, which serve as a bridge for socializing. However, as people age, their social circles stabilize and social needs may be met through more mature means, diminishing the role of gaming in socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-a-girl-out&#34;&gt;Taking a girl out
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, due to a lack of relationship education, children are pressured to focus solely on academics by their parents, then immediately pushed into relationships upon graduation—a very common phenomenon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lacking stable emotional relationships due to busy schedules, work commitments, or a lack of social skills can lead to feelings of loneliness and a desire for attention. &lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, by helping and protecting female players, they experience a sense of being needed and valued, achieving emotional fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the game&amp;rsquo;s clear interaction rules and controllable environment offer certainty and a sense of security compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real life, reducing fears about unpredictable social interactions. However, prolonged reliance on virtual gratification within games may negatively impact their ability to form and maintain healthy emotional relationships in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reality-pressure&#34;&gt;Reality pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games offer a virtual world where players can temporarily escape the pressures, challenges, or unpleasant emotions of reality. This is particularly true for young people facing academic stress, family issues, or relationship difficulties, for whom games may be a way to seek comfort and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are often designed to provide players with a sense of accomplishment and recognition for completing tasks, leveling up, or defeating opponents. Young people may become addicted to games because they offer a feeling of being appreciated and acknowledged, which they may lack in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-getting-older-they-dont-like-playing-anymore&#34;&gt;After getting older, they don&amp;rsquo;t like playing anymore
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young, individuals face fewer social responsibilities and pressures, allowing more time and energy for gaming. As they enter the workforce and start families, increased responsibilities make time and energy more valuable, potentially leading to gaming being seen as a time sink rather than a preferred leisure activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, their cognitive abilities and interests evolve. What might appeal to someone in their youth—fast-paced, visually impressive games—may later give way to a preference for strategic, story-driven, or more complex experiences. If the market fails to meet these changing needs, interest will naturally decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Renminbi exchange rate has seen significant volatility, breaking through 7.26</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/renminbi-exchange-rate-volatility/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 00:31:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/renminbi-exchange-rate-volatility/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fluctuations in the Renminbi exchange rate and the broader market decline are likely linked to global central bank policies, the Swiss National Bank&amp;rsquo;s surprise interest rate cut, US economic data performance, and adjustments in market expectations regarding inflation and interest rate cuts. These factors collectively impacted the foreign exchange and stock markets, leading to Renminbi volatility and A-share declines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the link provided, the Renminbi exchange rate experienced a significant fluctuation on March 22, 2024. Here are the details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yuan weakened at opening, with the dollar exceeding 7.24 against the offshore RMB to 7.24926 and surpassing 7.22 against the onshore RMB to 7.22360, both breaking highs seen since November 17, 2023. At the time of this report, the dollar has broken past 7.26, reaching a low of 7.2639, and the trend continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 22, the central bank set the midpoint of the yuan against the dollar at 7.1004, a decrease of 62 basis points, with an expanded adjustment range&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affected by multiple factors, China&amp;rsquo;s three major A-share indices opened and closed lower, with declines exceeding 1%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A senior currency trader at a Hong Kong investment firm stated that foreign exchange market volatility is primarily due to the Swiss National Bank&amp;rsquo;s unexpected rate cut boosting the dollar, combined with a strong US economy and persistent inflation potentially delaying interest rate cuts, leading to an increase in the dollar index&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week is a &amp;ldquo;super central bank week&amp;rdquo; for global markets, with interest rate decisions to be announced by central banks in the US, Japan, UK, Australia, and more. The Swiss National Bank&amp;rsquo;s surprise rate cut marks the first such action among G10 central banks since the pandemic began, disrupting market equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guangda Bank financial market researcher Zhou Maohua stated that despite recent RMB fluctuations, the overall magnitude is significantly smaller than that of major currencies like the US dollar, and short-term volatility will not alter the year&amp;rsquo;s upward trend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Storing Custom Objects in Python Dictionaries: The Importance of References vs. Deep Copies</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/python-dictionary-custom-objects-reference-vs-deepcopy/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 01:08:05 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In Python programming, dictionaries are a powerful data structure that allows us to associate key-value pairs and efficiently find and manipulate this data. When storing custom objects in a dictionary, we encounter a crucial concept: object assignment in Python is actually reference assignment, not a deep copy of the object itself. This means that when a custom object is placed into a dictionary, the dictionary stores a reference to that object, rather than a brand new copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storing-custom-objects---basic-example&#34;&gt;Storing Custom Objects - Basic Example
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have a simple ____ class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# 创建一个 Person 对象
p1 = Person(&amp;quot;Alice&amp;quot;, 30)

# 将对象存储到字典中
people_dict = {}
people_dict[&amp;quot;alice&amp;quot;] = p1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the attributes of &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; 字典现在包含一个键为 &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_1&lt;/strong&gt; 的项，其值是对 &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_2&lt;/strong&gt; 类型的 &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt; 对象的引用。如果我们修改 &lt;code&gt;p1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;p1.age = 31
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When accessing this object through the dictionary, we find that its age has also been updated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;print(people_dict[&amp;quot;alice&amp;quot;].age)  # 输出：31
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because the dictionary stores references to the same memory address, not independent copies of the objects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-difference-between-deep-copy-and-shallow-copy&#34;&gt;The difference between deep copy and shallow copy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This referencing behavior can lead to unexpected results when dealing with nested data structures or custom objects. For example, modifying an object directly stored in a dictionary—especially if it contains mutable attributes like lists or other custom objects—will affect the object retrieved through the dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;class Address:
    def __init__(self, street, city):
        self.street = street
        self.city = city

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age, address):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.address = address

address = Address(&amp;quot;Main St.&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Springfield&amp;quot;)
p1 = Person(&amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;, 40, address)
people_dict[&amp;quot;bob&amp;quot;] = p1

# 修改原始地址对象
address.city = &amp;quot;Shelbyville&amp;quot;

# 字典中的人的地址也变了
print(people_dict[&amp;quot;bob&amp;quot;].address.city)  # 输出：Shelbyville
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid problems caused by this shared state, sometimes we need to ensure that the dictionary stores a complete copy of an object, rather than a reference. Python provides the &lt;code&gt;copy()&lt;/code&gt; function to achieve this goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import copy

# 使用深拷贝存储对象
people_dict[&amp;quot;bob_deepcopy&amp;quot;] = copy.deepcopy(p1)

# 此时即使修改原始地址对象，深拷贝的对象不会受影响
address.city = &amp;quot;Capital City&amp;quot;
print(people_dict[&amp;quot;bob&amp;quot;].address.city)  # 输出：Capital City
print(people_dict[&amp;quot;bob_deepcopy&amp;quot;].address.city)  # 输出：Shelbyville
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using dictionaries to store custom objects in Python, be mindful that object references are stored by default. For situations requiring independent state, use deep copying to avoid unexpected data changes due to shared references.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Starch-Wrapped Meat Snacks and Street Vendors: The New Influence of Capital</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In reality, 3/15 did not report on &amp;ldquo;chicken bone gel,&amp;rdquo; and this issue is confusing the CCTV 3/15 Gala&amp;rsquo;s official exposure with other simultaneous food safety incidents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-just-paste-the-text-here&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are! Just paste the text here.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 315 Gala highlighted nine manufacturers, but none were starch-filled sausages (淀粉肠). Now, the nominated brands have lost their buzz, while this focus on starch-filled sausages—a popular snack widely available across China—feels like a scapegoat. I traced the online news source to a CCTV report published on 3/15 investigating ham sausages, which simply listed ingredients from several manufacturers without issue. Then, a reporter claimed, based on hearsay from a factory employee, that chicken bone meal was sometimes used as a substitute for chicken meat. She then asked pet food retailers selling chicken bone meal if it&amp;rsquo;s safe for human consumption—a ridiculous question! A pet food vendor wouldn’t advise someone to eat it. This led to rumors claiming starch-filled sausages contained chicken bone meal, which is unsafe for humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, many factories are likely facing closure, and hundreds of thousands of small vendors across the country are on the brink of losing their livelihoods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reality-of-the-world&#34;&gt;Reality of the world
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a report by the Xiaoxiang Morning News on March 17th, on March 16th in Sanmenxia, Henan, the day after the &amp;ldquo;starch-tube collapse&amp;rdquo; incident, a vendor set up a stall selling starch tubes, but after two hours with no customers, she quietly ate them herself. The person filming said he normally eats four or five starch tubes at a time, but has stopped eating them entirely since learning about the chicken bone powder found inside. He was curious to see if anyone would still buy starch tubes after the exposure, and witnessed the vendor selling nothing in two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auntie has no idea about this tapioca sausage incident; she just knows that suddenly, nobody is buying her grilled sausages today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The older woman isn&amp;rsquo;t wrong; she’s just trying to support her family. She doesn’t even know if the product is faulty or qualified, nor does she understand what &amp;ldquo;bone glue&amp;rdquo; is. They are simply people at the bottom, struggling to survive without knowledge of the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The starch sausage collapsed, but those paying the bill are individual grassroots vendors. It&amp;rsquo;s a painful process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, one afternoon, a colleague who had moved from out of town and I went for lunch, passing by a street vendor selling grilled sausages and sliced steak on a hot plate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blurted out, &amp;ldquo;Do people even eat this kind of high-tech sausage and sirloin anymore?&amp;rdquo; Because in my mind, it had been nearly fifteen years since I last ate a processed meat stick like that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague hesitated, then gently said, &amp;ldquo;Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because you live in a big city. In my hometown, preserved vegetables, instant noodles, and sausage are everyday staples.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in school, my dad would only buy me a grilled sausage if I got a perfect score on my test. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t because they were unhealthy; it’s just that a sausage cost 1.5 yuan – enough to buy two pounds of vegetables instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard about calling instant noodles, carbonated drinks, and spicy-flavored fish snacks &amp;ldquo;junk food&amp;rdquo; after I started studying in Beijing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized the arrogance in my careless words and fell silent. However, this experience left a deep impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this is the daily life of most ordinary people in China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lives lacked fancy trends like the &amp;ldquo;Mediterranean diet,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;organic vegetables,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;non-GMO soybeans.&amp;rdquo; They only cared about whether they could afford some cheap and tasty vegetables, meat, and snacks, allowing their whole family to enjoy a few moments of happiness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the items on the shelves, their composition, whether they could harm their health, and if they contain any unusual chemical ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was never something they should concern themselves with or understand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after watching the 315 gala, everyone realized that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market electronics scales and gas pumps at filling stations can be rigged with modified circuit boards, requiring content creators to risk physical harm filming evidence before authorities finally take notice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;health tonic&amp;rdquo; alcohol heavily promoted on TV channels and airport advertisements was abruptly removed and disappeared from public view after a video exposed its deceptive practices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is once a year enough to eliminate five or six products that have been sold for a long time through a lottery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where else would they go, those consumers who have already bought from us?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Why is the speed only 100 Mbps despite having newly installed gigabit fiber?</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Want lightning-fast home internet? It all comes down to choosing the right network cable, configuring your ONT and router, and paying attention to those subtle details. This blog will guide you through creating a gigabit network with Cat6 cables and how to ensure optimal speed through simple device checks and configurations. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore together and boost your home internet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-in-depth-analysis-of-network-transmission-media&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: In-depth Analysis of Network Transmission Media
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When discussing achieving gigabit network access, the carrier—network cables—plays a crucial role in transmitting high-speed information. The following provides a detailed explanation of Cat 5, Cat 6, and Cat 7 cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-provided-text-is-empty-please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate&#34;&gt;The provided text is empty. Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate.
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Category 5 Ethernet cable, also known as CAT5, is an early type of twisted-pair cabling that uses a precise spiral structure to reduce crosstalk. It&amp;rsquo;s primarily suitable for 10/100Mbps Fast Ethernet with a maximum transmission frequency of approximately 100MHz. While widely used in the past, it cannot meet current demands for gigabit and higher speeds due to physical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With technological advancements, Cat6 cabling emerged. Compared to Cat5 cabling, Cat6 utilizes stricter manufacturing standards and more advanced structural designs, significantly improving interference resistance and transmission efficiency. It supports transfer rates up to 1Gbps and can achieve a distance of 100 meters under ideal conditions – perfectly meeting the access requirements for Gigabit networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Category 7 cabling represents the pinnacle of current twisted-pair technology. It offers a significant increase in transmission rates, theoretically supporting up to 10Gbps, and incorporates a complete shielding system—shielding for each pair of wires as well as overall outer shielding—to greatly reduce external electromagnetic interference and near-end crosstalk, ensuring data transmission stability and accuracy. However, Category 7 cabling is primarily intended for future 10 Gigabit Ethernet or specific high-demand applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building a Gigabit home network, using Cat6 cabling is the most economical and efficient choice to fully leverage the potential of Gigabit fiber. Ensuring all connection cables are of qualified quality and strictly following standard wiring practices are also crucial for network performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-delving-into-network-core-devices--the-impact-of-optical-network-terminal-ont-and-router-lan-port-bandwidth&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: Delving into Network Core Devices – The Impact of Optical Network Terminal (ONT) and Router LAN Port Bandwidth
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-importance-of-the-optical-network-terminal-ont-and-its-lan-port-bandwidth&#34;&gt;The importance of the optical network terminal (ONT) and its LAN port bandwidth
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Optical Network Terminal (ONT), also known as an optical modem, is the core device for home broadband access. Its function is to convert the light signal from fiber optic cables into digital signals for use by home network devices. For gigabit fiber users, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial that the ONT supports gigabit transmission. If the ONT’s WAN port only supports 100 Mbps, even with a higher-speed fiber connection, the speed will be limited to 100 Mbps due to this bottleneck. Similarly, the ONT’s LAN port also needs to have gigabit output capabilities; otherwise, routers or other connected devices won&amp;rsquo;t achieve true gigabit speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-role-of-bandwidth-for-router-lan-ports&#34;&gt;The role of bandwidth for router LAN ports
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The router&amp;rsquo;s LAN port distributes received data to terminal devices. When the LAN port is limited to Gigabit, even with well-configured devices, network communication will be restricted to a 100Mbps speed. Therefore, when building a Gigabit home network, ensure the router’s WAN port can receive Gigabit data and that its LAN port also offers Gigabit output capabilities so all smart devices can enjoy a smooth experience thanks to high-speed networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that some older or lower-end routers may have a LAN port auto-negotiation mechanism. This means they might operate in 100Mbps mode instead of Gigabit, even if the router itself supports it, due to factors like cabling or device compatibility. Therefore, correctly configuring router parameters, enabling forced Gigabit mode, and using a Gigabit switch or direct connection are crucial steps for achieving a full Gigabit network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After upgrading to fiber optic internet, be sure to check and replace your optical network terminal (ONT) and router with gigabit-compatible devices to ensure all interfaces meet the gigabit standard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-the-hidden-mystery--how-a-broken-sub-thread-impacts-gigabit-network-speed&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: The Hidden Mystery – How a Broken Sub-Thread Impacts Gigabit Network Speed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;subnet-cable-failure-and-network-performance-degradation&#34;&gt;Subnet cable failure and network performance degradation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network remained connected throughout the speed test, with no apparent disconnections. As this is a newly installed broadband connection, the utility box is cluttered and adjustments to the optical network terminal&amp;rsquo;s cabling and power outlet placement occasionally result in speeds reaching gigabit levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on previous data, we analyzed and eliminated potential issues such as network cable model and optical modem LAN port speed, ultimately discovering that a broken brown internal wire within the network cable was the culprit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cable broke because the installer pulled on it too hard when installing the crystal head, partially severing a wire. Subsequent movement while adjusting the optical network terminal&amp;rsquo;s location eventually caused it to break completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;functionality-of-eight-wires-in-six-categories-of-network-cables&#34;&gt;Functionality of Eight Wires in Six Categories of Network Cables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six-category network cables follow the TIA/EIA-568-B standard, consisting of eight twisted pairs with the following color coding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Orange / Orange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White-green / Green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue / Light Blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Gigabit Ethernet (1000BASE-T) standards, these eight wires operate with four pairs working simultaneously, each with a specific function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These wires (1 &amp;amp; 2), labeled white-orange and orange, are used for data transmission (Tx+/–)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These wires (3 &amp;amp; 6) – white/green and green – are used for data reception (Rx+/–)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These pairs of wires—white-blue and blue (4&amp;amp;5) and white-brown and brown (7&amp;amp;8)—are not typically used in Gigabit Ethernet, but may be enabled in certain advanced applications like partial PoE power or future technology extensions. In traditional 100Mbps networks, only the four wires 1, 2, 3, and 6 are required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-impact-of-broken-chains-on-network-speed&#34;&gt;The impact of broken chains on network speed
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the described scenario, if a brown sub-line (brown or brown-white) is broken, it can theoretically reduce speed in a Gigabit network because Gigabit networks require simultaneous bidirectional transmission on all four pairs of wires to achieve full speed. However, due to the auto-negotiation feature often found in home network devices, when a cable issue is detected, they will revert to a lower, functional rate – typically 100Mbps. This explains why the connection remains active and operates at 100Mbps even with one sub-line broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, while a single broken brown fiber strand doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect basic gigabit network operation, it can be a key factor limiting speed in a terabit environment. Only through thorough diagnosis and repair can the full potential of the terabit fiber be realized. This serves as a reminder that we shouldn’t overlook any potential network infrastructure issues, even seemingly minor faults that don&amp;rsquo;t impact basic connectivity, as they may become hidden obstacles to high-speed network performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>UI Thread Issues and Solutions in WPF</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/wpf-ui-thread-and-freezing-issues-solutions/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 07:12:21 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/wpf-ui-thread-and-freezing-issues-solutions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Correctly handling the user interface (UI) thread is crucial for ensuring application smoothness and responsiveness, especially when developing desktop applications and building rich client applications using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework. The UI thread, also known as the main thread, is the core thread responsible for processing window and control events, layout calculations, and rendering the interface. All interactions with UI elements should be performed on the UI thread; this is a fundamental principle followed by WPF and most other GUI frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-ui-thread&#34;&gt;What is the UI thread?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UI thread is created and initialized by the operating system when a WPF application starts, and it&amp;rsquo;s the only thread that can directly access and modify the state of UI components. All user interactions—such as button clicks, text box input, and window resizing—are handled within this thread’s context. Furthermore, WPF’s dependency property system, data binding mechanism, and layout logic all execute synchronously on the UI thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lag-and-its-causes&#34;&gt;Lag and its causes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the UI thread is occupied or blocked for an extended period—for example, due to lengthy calculations, large data loads, database queries, or other I/O-intensive tasks—it can fail to respond promptly to user interactions, resulting in a frozen interface (freeze), commonly known as &amp;ldquo;lag.&amp;rdquo; This causes noticeable application latency and sluggishness; severe cases may trigger an “Application Not Responding” (ANR) warning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;two-basic-rules-of-the-ui-thread&#34;&gt;Two basic rules of the UI thread
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid these situations, WPF developers should follow two key rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any operation that may cause the UI thread to hang should be moved to a background thread as much as possible to ensure the UI thread can promptly respond to user input and render screen changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to WPF&amp;rsquo;s security mechanism, only the UI thread is authorized to modify UI elements. Attempting to directly change the UI state from another thread will result in an exception. Therefore, even after background threads complete calculations or data preparation, results must be displayed on the UI through appropriate cross-thread communication mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution-asynchronous-programming-and-thread-safe-updates&#34;&gt;Solution: Asynchronous Programming and Thread-Safe Updates
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WPF offers various asynchronous programming models and tools to help developers achieve this while maintaining a smooth UI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The WPF Dispatcher class allows you to schedule work items for execution in the UI thread&amp;rsquo;s task queue. You can use the &lt;code&gt;Invoke&lt;/code&gt; method to safely update the UI from background threads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By leveraging C#&amp;rsquo;s asynchronous features, you can write asynchronous methods and use the &lt;code&gt;__INLINE_CODE_0__&lt;/code&gt; keyword to wait for background tasks to complete, automatically returning to the UI thread to execute subsequent UI update code upon completion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-study&#34;&gt;Case study
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-ui-using-the-__inline_code_0__-method&#34;&gt;Update UI using the &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; method
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    // 假设这是一个耗时操作
    Task.Run(() =&amp;gt;
    {
        var result = LongRunningOperation(); // 这里是模拟一个耗时计算的方法
        
        // 当耗时操作完成后，在UI线程上更新UI
        Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(() =&amp;gt;
        {
            LabelStatus.Text = $&amp;quot;计算结果: {result}&amp;quot;;
        });
    });
}

private string LongRunningOperation()
{
    // 模拟耗时操作
    Thread.Sleep(5000);
    return &amp;quot;已完成&amp;quot;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-__inline_code_0__bold_2taskrun&#34;&gt;Use __INLINE_CODE_0__BOLD_2&lt;code&gt;Task.Run&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-csharp&#34;&gt;private async void Button_ClickAsync(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    Button button = sender as Button;
    button.IsEnabled = false; // 防止用户重复点击

    try
    {
        // 开启后台任务
        var result = await Task.Run(() =&amp;gt; LongRunningOperation());

        // 在后台任务完成后，自动切换回UI线程更新UI
        LabelStatus.Text = $&amp;quot;计算结果: {result}&amp;quot;;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        MessageBox.Show($&amp;quot;发生错误: {ex.Message}&amp;quot;);
    }
    finally
    {
        button.IsEnabled = true; // 重新启用按钮
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The program compiled and ran normally in the CentOS 7 environment, but crashed when switched to CentOS 8 and compiled with a newer version of GCC. Notably, this issue only occurred under &lt;strong&gt;Release 模式&lt;/strong&gt;, while &lt;strong&gt;Debug 模式&lt;/strong&gt; was unaffected. This was the first time we encountered such a situation, and after three days of troubleshooting, we finally found the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The root cause of the problem lies in &lt;strong&gt;函数缺少返回值&lt;/strong&gt;. The increased optimization performed by newer versions of GCC in Release mode has introduced unknown logic into functions without explicit return values, leading to crashes. Our conclusion is that &lt;strong&gt;编译器的警告不容忽视，尤其是在老项目中，部分警告可能被无视，但也应当避免屏蔽所有警告&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crash-phenomenon&#34;&gt;Crash phenomenon
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When analyzing the program crash stack, we observed the following stack information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;[New LWP 1385902]
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Using host libthread_db library &amp;quot;/lib64/libthread_db.so.1&amp;quot;.
Core was generated by `./pstack_main`.
Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x00007ffe894b4420 in ?? ()
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007ffe894b4420 in ?? ()
#1  0x00000000004008e9 in main ()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stack trace isn&amp;rsquo;t intuitive; the crash information shows as a &lt;code&gt;__INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/code&gt;, making debugging more difficult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;code-example&#34;&gt;Code example
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the issue, here&amp;rsquo;s a minimal code example to reproduce the crash:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;map&amp;gt;

int test() {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
}

int main() {
    test();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a ``test()&lt;code&gt; 函数显然没有显式返回一个值，而它的返回类型是 __INLINE_CODE_1__。根据 C++ 规范，当一个函数声明为 __INLINE_CODE_2__&lt;/code&gt; type is used, it must have a return value; otherwise, undefined behavior may occur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compilation-warning&#34;&gt;Compilation warning
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our project, CMake scripts suppress many compile-time warnings, including the following message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;/root/pstack/main.cpp: In function ‘int test()’:
/root/pstack/main.cpp:7:1: warning: no return statement in function returning non-void [-Wreturn-type]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This warning indicates that the &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; function has no return value, which is the root of the problem. High-version GCC (such as 8.5.0) may perform unstable optimizations on this undefined behavior during code optimization, leading to program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;assembly-code-differences&#34;&gt;Assembly code differences
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain the differences in GCC compiler optimization behavior, we compared assembly code generated by different versions of GCC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assembly code is lengthy and includes excessive optimizations for issues like the missing return value in functions such as __INLINE_CODE_0__BOLD_2&lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt;, which may have prevented a crash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new version of GCC includes more optimizations that reduce code size. However, these optimizations can lead to undefined behavior when executing functions lacking return values, potentially causing program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This troubleshooting has highlighted the importance of carefully addressing warnings in C++, particularly when functions are declared inline. It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to selectively handle these warnings, especially those related to function return values and type matching, rather than suppressing them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue was resolved by adding a return value to the &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; function, and the program returned to normal operation&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>VMware virtual machine CPU resource usage anomaly</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-machine-cpu-resource-usage-anomaly/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 22:14:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-machine-cpu-resource-usage-anomaly/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The local machine runs a Windows-based business system with approximately 5% CPU usage. A Linux-based business system deployed in VMware&amp;rsquo;s CentOS8 experiences abnormal resource utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-description&#34;&gt;Problem description
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host machine: Windows 10 Enterprise Edition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vmware：17.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual machine: CentOS 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual machine resource allocation is &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling the business system. The business system is deployed in a virtual machine Linux environment. Observing system resource usage within the VM using the top command shows low CPU utilization. However, the outer Windows system&amp;rsquo;s Task Manager indicates high CPU usage; investigating processes reveals that the VMware process consumes significant CPU resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;+
|         Windows           |
|                           |
|   +&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;+  |
|   |      VMware        |  |
|   |      Program       |  |
|   +&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;+  |
|                           |
+&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;+&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-points&#34;&gt;Key points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting this issue proved difficult, as the root cause wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the business system itself but rather a problem with the virtual machine. This article will first explain relevant concepts, then provide a solution, detailing how to shift focus from typical business code to system load, identify anomalies in load data, pinpoint soft interrupts, and ultimately determine what factors impact VMware soft interrupt efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hyper-v&#34;&gt;hyper-v
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtualization technology for Windows has undergone a significant change. When Microsoft first released WSL, enabling the Hyper-V service would prevent the simultaneous use of VMware virtual machines. Compatibility between VMware and Hyper-V services wasn&amp;rsquo;t achieved until later versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;system-load&#34;&gt;System load
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Linux system, &amp;ldquo;load&amp;rdquo; refers to the number of processes running or waiting to execute. It&amp;rsquo;s typically represented by three numbers indicating the average number of processes in the run queue over 1, 5, and 15-minute intervals. These figures can be viewed using commands like &amp;ldquo;uptime&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;top.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, these three numbers represent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average number of processes in the system&amp;rsquo;s run queue over the past minute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average number of processes in the running queue over the past 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average number of processes in the running queue over the past 15 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load refers to the number of processes waiting to run in a system. If this number exceeds the logical CPU count, it indicates high system load, meaning many processes are competing for processor resources. This can lead to sluggishness or unresponsiveness, depending on the severity of the load and the system&amp;rsquo;s configuration and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the load should remain within the logical CPU count of the system to optimize performance. If the load consistently exceeds the CPU count, further analysis of processes is needed to identify the cause and take appropriate measures to adjust resource allocation or optimize process execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analyzing-load-with-mpstat&#34;&gt;Analyzing load with mpstat
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steps for conducting a load analysis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;安装 sysstat&lt;/strong&gt;:
If it is not installed on your system, you can install it using a package management tool suitable for your system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;运行 mpstat&lt;/strong&gt;:
Indicates resource consumption&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;01:32:33 PM  CPU    %usr   %nice    %sys %iowait    %irq   %soft  %steal  %guest  %gnice   %idle
01:32:35 PM  all    0.00    0.00    0.26    0.00    3.73    0.26    0.00    0.00    0.00   95.76
01:32:35 PM    0    0.00    0.00    0.51    0.00    3.57    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00   95.92
01:32:35 PM    1    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    3.59    0.51    0.00    0.00    0.00   95.90
01:32:35 PM    2    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    4.15    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00   95.85
01:32:35 PM    3    0.00    0.00    0.52    0.00    3.61    0.52    0.00    0.00    0.00   95.36
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;分析输出&lt;/strong&gt;:
The output includes the utilization rate of each CPU and the system&amp;rsquo;s average load. Monitoring the average load and individual CPU utilization can help you understand system load. High loads warrant further analysis to identify contributing processes and potential performance bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;结合其他工具&lt;/strong&gt;:
In addition to tools like these, we can comprehensively analyze system performance. Combining the outputs of various tools allows for a more thorough understanding of system load and helps identify the root causes of performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interruption&#34;&gt;Interruption
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t elaborate on the details here
Recommended: [LINK_0]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequent triggering of soft interrupts will be reflected in system load&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting&#34;&gt;troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that analyzing the issue solely from a CPU perspective is insufficient, should we suspect a system anomaly? It could be due to excessive load on the Linux operating system, causing VMware to consume an excessive amount of CPU resources. The utilization percentage should be approximately 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His CentOS 7 deployment on VMware in the team&amp;rsquo;s development environment shows normal resource usage. However, in the Shanghai development environment, although also using VMware, we cannot directly observe the host CPU resources. This presents multiple variables: the VMware virtual machine, the Linux operating system, and the GCC version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shifting focus to the testing environment, Shenzhen&amp;rsquo;s testing environment is deployed on physical machines running a low-version GCC compilation service and operating on CentOS 8. Interestingly, in the Shenzhen environment, &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; usage is normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate issues introduced by newer GCC versions, we deployed programs compiled with a higher version of GCC to the Shenzhen environment for testing, and the results were all normal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue appears to be becoming clearer; we&amp;rsquo;re starting to suspect a problem with the operating system. After all, CentOS 8 is no longer officially supported. However, even after redeploying clean installations of both CentOS 7 and CentOS 8, the problem persists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we began to suspect the sole uncertainty: VMware virtualization software. Then it occurred to us – Hyper-V technology. Could Hyper-V have been previously enabled but not fully shut down, causing this issue? After all, soft interrupts are implemented through virtualization software. Are there bugs in different virtualization technologies? These questions warrant further consideration and investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s official documentation, we completely shut down the local Hyper-V service and found that VMware then functioned normally on the host. This resolved the issue. As mentioned earlier, this experience was complex and arduous, requiring comprehensive analysis and judgment. It also marked our first time troubleshooting a problem and identifying it at the virtual machine level.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Traps in C&#43;&#43; Programming: Detailed Explanation of Program Crashes Due to Misusing `std::map`</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-programming-traps-std-map-crash-details/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 22:03:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/cpp-programming-traps-std-map-crash-details/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This article aims to reveal how improper use of C++ containers can lead to program crashes. Attempting to access a non-existent key using the bracket operator automatically adds an empty element. We will analyze this misunderstanding and demonstrate its potential risks with example code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing simple values is fine, but problems arise when storing pointers. Since a pointer is an address, if it&amp;rsquo;s not initialized, the address is undefined, which can lead to program crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the C++ standard library, &lt;code&gt;_ITERATOR_categories&lt;/code&gt; inserts a new key-value pair, and the default constructor will be used to initialize the value type corresponding to that key&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;map&amp;gt;

int main() {
    std::map&amp;lt;std::string, int&amp;gt; myMap;
    
    // 错误的用法：假设这里试图访问一个不存在的键并认为会得到0
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Value for &#39;nonexistent_key&#39;: &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; myMap[&amp;quot;nonexistent_key&amp;quot;] &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;

    // 实际上，上述行代码创建了一个新的键值对，其中值被默认初始化为int的默认值（通常是0）
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this code doesn&amp;rsquo;t directly cause the program to crash, such implicit insertion behavior can potentially lead to unexpected side effects in certain situations, like resource leaks or state changes that don&amp;rsquo;t meet expectations. Worse still, concurrent access to uninitialized memory regions in a multithreaded environment could even trigger a program crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent such issues, it is recommended to explicitly insert elements using ____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-cpp&#34;&gt;std::map&amp;lt;std::string, int&amp;gt; safeMap;
if (safeMap.count(&amp;quot;nonexistent_key&amp;quot;) == 0) {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Key does not exist.&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Value for existing key: &amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; safeMap[&amp;quot;nonexistent_key&amp;quot;] &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;
}

// 或者明确插入一个键值对，指定初始值
safeMap.insert({ &amp;quot;new_key&amp;quot;, 0 });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the objects stored in a &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; container are of pointer type, the automatic insertion behavior will save an uninitialized pointer, and any operation on this pointer will lead to program crashes&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Troubleshooting process hangs using pstack</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/pstack-troubleshooting-process-hang/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2024 23:55:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/pstack-troubleshooting-process-hang/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In software development and operations, process freezes are frequently encountered, leading to system performance degradation or service unavailability. This article introduces the use of the &lt;code&gt;pstack&lt;/code&gt; tool to troubleshoot frozen processes by analyzing stack information to identify and resolve root causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk control system&amp;rsquo;s sub-service experienced a freeze, rendering the risk control service unavailable. Due to a lack of service availability monitoring, the frozen process was not detected promptly, leading to system unavailability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hung process is a state where the process stops responding but does not exit. This can be caused by various factors, such as deadlocks, resource exhaustion, or exceptions. To resolve these issues, we can use the pstack tool to analyze the process&amp;rsquo;s stack information and identify the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps&#34;&gt;Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;pstack is a commonly used tool, typically provided with gdb (the GNU debugger). You can install it using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo apt-get install gdb
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain the process ID: First, we need to get the process ID (PID) of the frozen process. You can use the &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; command to list all processes and find the PID you want to troubleshoot.
Use the pstack tool to analyze process stacks. Once you have obtained the process ID, you can use pstack to retrieve stack information for that process. Run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;pstack &amp;lt;PID&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will output the process&amp;rsquo;s stack information, displaying the current sequence of function calls. Analyzing this information can reveal where the process is stalled and help locate the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing stack information can help identify the cause of process freezes. This may reveal deadlocks, infinite loops, or other anomalies. Take appropriate measures based on the specific situation, such as releasing locks or fixing code logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-study&#34;&gt;Case study
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple demo where, after the main function starts, a new sub-thread is created. The actual execution function enters an infinite loop, causing the program to fail to terminate normally and enter a frozen state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0.0)
project(pstack_main VERSION 0.1.0 LANGUAGES C CXX)

include(CTest)

set(CPACK_PROJECT_NAME ${PROJECT_NAME})
set(CPACK_PROJECT_VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION})
include(CPack)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;thread&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;chrono&amp;gt;

void infiniteLoop() {
    while (true) {
        // 主线程进入死循环
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread thread(infiniteLoop); // 创建一个线程，执行死循环函数
    thread.join(); // 等待线程结束
    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If I had followed my family&amp;rsquo;s plans and stuck with studying electrical engineering instead of writing code, I probably would have been a typical obedient son&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dusting off memories, sparked by the approaching Spring Festival and a conversation with my roommate, prompting a review of these past years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-one&#34;&gt;Chapter One
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gaokao results weren&amp;rsquo;t particularly good or bad. I graduated from a 211 university, but according to my father’s original plan, I should have studied power grids and returned to work at the local electricity bureau. As mentioned earlier, I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly touch on how I ended up in IT—I forgot to mention one key factor: my values and self-discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still in a rural school during my first year of junior high, my family arranged for me to transfer to a city school by my second year. It felt like Liu姥姥 visiting the Grand View Garden – I struggled to adapt to the city&amp;rsquo;s vibrancy. I hadn’t gone to the cinema many times as a child, certainly not with my parents; relatives had taken me occasionally. Fortunately, I made friends with several like-minded guys. Though we don&amp;rsquo;t keep in touch much now, those youthful days were still good. After tutoring on weekends, we would collect plastic bottles from the classroom, expertly crushing them with our feet and packing them into bags to take home for my mom to save. Once we had enough, we’d find someone to recycle them. We played chess, badminton, and Dou Di Zhu (a card game), and the losers had to do push-ups. I was even a little grateful then that my dad had been getting me involved in various sports since I was young. That&amp;rsquo;s when my perspective on money started to shift, and I felt slightly inferior. But these minor misfortunes were fleeting. My family wasn’t wealthy; we didn’t have much pocket money, and sometimes I couldn’t play with the other kids, especially on weekends. My parents’ hard work was visible – we moved from the village to the city. The seeds had been planted, waiting to sprout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being a simple person, I was generally very happy during my studies—a feeling many don&amp;rsquo;t experience until after graduation. Studying isn’t particularly difficult; the conversion of effort to results is relatively straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining childhood memories of the imperial era with university life, encountering a laptop felt like opening Pandora&amp;rsquo;s Box. I was introduced to games and connected with the role of a game merchant. Initially, I was a low-level salesperson, purchasing goods upstream and selling them through my own network, earning small sums. Gradually, I understood the entire operational logic of the chain. The goods we sold were essentially batch-incubated by upstream programs with near-zero costs. At this point, things started to veer off course. My major had specialized branches – electrical grids on one side, and automation (a broad field including chip programming and factory electrical automation) on the other. Realizing that programming could make significant money, and seeing how much profit was made upstream, combined with my existing programming background, I began experimenting and earning small amounts of money. During major selection, I naturally chose automation. I skipped many required courses in my junior year, constantly thinking about writing code to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year&amp;rsquo;s article mentioned that, driven by a romanticized view of hackers and with the kindness of IT experience, I delved into assembly, penetration testing, game hacks, DLL hijacking, and account theft, becoming familiar with various black and gray industries. My parents taught me ethics, and the law still guided me; I didn&amp;rsquo;t go completely astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous article link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During university, I had one relationship. Looking back, it was more about longing for the kind of love seen in TV dramas. At that time, my emotional maturity wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready to understand how to truly love someone, let alone build a family and establish a career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-two&#34;&gt;Chapter Two
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been fortunate. My university years didn&amp;rsquo;t lead to graduate school; I started working right after graduation and benefited from the boom in the IT industry. It’s been eight years now, but the hype has faded and the era is coming to a close. Sometimes I wonder if I made the wrong choice, perhaps entering the power grid as my father suggested would have been better. That thought lingered for the first five years, but gradually disappeared. Joining HSBC through campus recruitment, I didn’t switch companies for five years – this left gaps in my technical understanding, industry knowledge, and self-awareness. Following instructions from headquarters in Hangzhou, I went to Shenzhen, experienced a workplace power struggle (which I later realized was a loss for everyone involved, with the board ultimately winning), and returned to Hangzhou fueled by a passion for technology. With a touch of youthful naivete, I left Hangzhou and moved to Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally planned to settle, register residency, and buy a home in Hangzhou. With interest rates at their peak and housing prices at their highest, entering the market would likely lead to being stuck with a mortgage; my family savings are too thin to handle it. The thought of marrying under that kind of financial pressure, compounded by industry downturns, makes me emotionally unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-three&#34;&gt;Chapter Three
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After so many years, witnessing so much, experiencing my own foolishness and recklessness, I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing well. Through experiences and encounters with people, I’ve gradually matured. Staying at home would have left those personality flaws to erupt in some unknown way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We conducted a time-consuming test of the design quote SDK, implementing different callback function approaches.

        <title>Why do computers commonly use little-endian storage?</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/little-endian-storage-why/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;An Explanation of Byte Order&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some design habits formed due to historical reasons in computer science are like the principle that the width of a horse&amp;rsquo;s rear end determines the width of a rocket engine – there’s no need to analyze their “advantages” or “disadvantages”; they’re simply historical conventions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current endianness situation is a result of historical habits and commercialization, not inherently related to the technology itself. ARM can be configured as either big-endian or little-endian. The TCP/IP header still uses big-endian (network byte order). Many storage protocols/specifications in the storage field also save data in big-endian format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, regarding the three questions posed by the original poster:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorrect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficiency is not higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguing these three issues based on current technology is like drawing a target before shooting an arrow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the choice between big-endian and little-endian, there were objective factors in computer history: Little-endian (host byte order) advantages: Implementing adders is easier. For an 8-bit * 4 adder, a single 8-bit adder suffices, with sequential addition from low to high bytes; the carry circuit is simple. Big-endian would require loading 32 bits at once, otherwise calculation is impossible. While the difference between loading 8 or 32 bits isn&amp;rsquo;t significant now, decades ago when memory was expensive, simplicity was key. Therefore, little-endian was chosen based on cost considerations. Big-endian (network byte order) advantages: Early devices had small caches; receiving high bytes allowed for quick determination of packet information – buffer size and address range (IP addresses are matched from front to back). Early network device caches operated on a byte basis, so retrieving the high byte was faster. Thus, big-endian was used in network devices, also based on cost considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, byte order selection was primarily driven by application scenarios and cost (e.g., PPC/MIPS being better suited for network devices). Later, due to compatibility reasons, the endian configuration has been retained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These advantages no longer exist; they&amp;rsquo;re merely historical habits&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>How to bypass debugging</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/program-how-to-anti-debug/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:46:36 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;On a whim, I&amp;rsquo;m looking for new wallpaper. I usually go with black backgrounds, with some colored accents. Since there will be icons on the desktop, other color schemes would make them unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After pondering the assembly code, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand it. I tried asking &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; for an explanation of the instructions, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t explain the context. It must be a specific scenario where these instructions are used; this isn&amp;rsquo;t typical code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search engine is better now; my assembly knowledge is lacking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wallpaper&#34;&gt;Wallpaper
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;assembly-code&#34;&gt;Assembly code
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;PUSHFD
MOV DWORD PTR [ESP],0X100
POPFD
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical application scenarios&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;bool IsDebugged()
{
    __try
    {
        __asm
        {
            pushfd
            mov dword ptr [esp], 0x100
            popfd
            nop
        }
        return true;
    }
    __except(GetExceptionCode() == EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP
        ? EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER
        : EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION)
    {
        return false;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanation&#34;&gt;Explanation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because if we track the code, this flag will be cleared by the debugger, so we won&amp;rsquo;t see this exception&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical testing, skipping the detection and debugging functions results in undetected debugging; it is only detected when entering the execution of the detection function. (Information gathered, not yet practically verified.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The related Chinese materials are translations of website drafts, which explain various anti-debugging techniques&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to download Focus Interviews/CCTV video files</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-download-focus-interview-cctv-video-files/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:23:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/how-to-download-focus-interview-cctv-video-files/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, someone asked how to download videos from &amp;ldquo;Focus Interviews.&amp;rdquo; I immediately thought it would be some form of encryption, but it was easily resolved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;downloader&#34;&gt;Downloader
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-CLI&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-CLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An open-source command-line m3u8/HLS/DASH downloader supporting standard AES-128-CBC decryption, multi-threading, and custom request headers. Supports Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;browser-extension&#34;&gt;Browser extension
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ngjclnbcdbahekojpkhancmiobdahemb&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Live Stream Downloader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;honey-glazed-confidence&#34;&gt;Honey-glazed confidence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I had the address, I thought it was resolved, but it turned out to be nothing. Unable to parse the segmented content properly, research revealed that the official download address has been handled and requires manual replacement—copying the &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; identified by the plugin and pasting it into the link below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;https://newcntv.qcloudcdn.com/asp/hls/2000/0303000a/3/default/***********************/2000.m3u8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of January 2024, address testing is valid. Any subsequent changes require self-analysis of the webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Batch modification of SQL Server database disk file permissions</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-modify-sqlserver-database-disk-file-permissions/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 19:06:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-modify-sqlserver-database-disk-file-permissions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Company security policy adjustments have been made. Due to irregular activation methods, it seems fine without activating for personal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activation through unconventional means triggered Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s detection. The server ran for half a month before automatically shutting down after one hour of startup. Examining the system logs revealed it was due to piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no way around it; another system reinstall is needed, &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; faces a reinstall too. Each time is quite troublesome due to strict file permission controls, preventing normal database appending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;error-message&#34;&gt;Error message
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After system reinstallation, 5120 errors and operating system access denials may occur in the supplemental database&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-script&#34;&gt;Process script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-repository-and-legacy-permission-issues/&#34; &gt;批量更新本地Git仓库&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s this familiar script again, modified to traverse folders while also changing file permissions – currently granting full editing access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most online tutorials require manual modification – do they only need to change a few files each time? I have to handle batches of files, all manually. It&amp;rsquo;s enough to make you feel depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;$currentUserName = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$rootDirectory = &amp;quot;D:\data\2013_RujiaInfo&amp;quot;

Get-ChildItem -Path $rootDirectory -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    $itemPath = $_.FullName

    if ($_ -is [System.IO.DirectoryInfo]) {
        $icaclsResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {

            Write-Host &amp;quot;已授予 $currentUserName 编辑文件夹的权限&amp;quot;
        } else {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;无法更改文件夹 $itemPath 的所有者。错误信息: $icaclsResult&amp;quot;
        }
    } else {
        $takeownResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            # 授予当前用户写入权限
            Invoke-Expression &amp;quot;icacls `&amp;quot;$itemPath`&amp;quot; /grant `&amp;quot;$($currentUserName):(F)`&amp;quot;&amp;quot;

        <title>Linux system benchmark testing</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/linux-system-benchmark-test/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 10:56:23 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/linux-system-benchmark-test/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Windows platform has &amp;ldquo;Ruluzishi&amp;rdquo; (Entertainment Master), which isn&amp;rsquo;t entirely accurate but provides a reference. There are also other professional benchmarking tools, but suitable ones are lacking on the Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sysbench is a versatile benchmarking tool that can be used to test CPU, memory, file I/O, and thread performance. You can use Sysbench to perform various performance testing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently have three machines available for testing: Mecha-Debug Mini local host, Alibaba Cloud Dev development cloud server, and Huawei Cloud development server&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-sysbench&#34;&gt;Installing Sysbench
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most Linux distributions, you can use a package management tool to install Sysbench. For example, on CentOS 8, you can use the following command for installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo dnf install sysbench
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sysbench-usage-examples&#34;&gt;Sysbench Usage Examples
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing CPU performance:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing memory read performance: &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing file I/O performance:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sysbench --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw prepare
sysbench --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw run
sysbench --test=fileio --file-test-mode=rndrw cleanup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing multi-threaded performance: &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing MySQL database performance (requires adjusting the maximum number of connections)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=yourusername --mysql-password=yourpassword --oltp-table-size=1000000 prepare
sysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=yourusername --mysql-password=yourpassword --max-time=60 --oltp-read-only=off --oltp-test-mode=complex --max-requests=0 run
sysbench --test=oltp --db-driver=mysql --mysql-db=test --mysql-user=yourusername --mysql-password=yourpassword cleanup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without proper formatting, the display will be very poor. The custom theme limits the maximum page width, and I&amp;rsquo;ve adjusted the page configuration to use percentage-based width restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple methods include using online tools like TablesGenerator to create HTML tables (unsuitable for complex content)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or use Google Docs, write there, then download as an HTML document and directly copy it into your blog (simple and direct, this is our final approach)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure the config is enabled with the unsafe option, and configure the width separately for each page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hugo, you can set the width for individual pages. This can be achieved by adding a custom parameter in the page&amp;rsquo;s Front Matter. Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a custom parameter, such as &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;, in the Front Matter section of your Markdown page (typically at the beginning of the file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;---
title: &amp;quot;我的页面&amp;quot;
date: 2024-01-09
custom_width: &amp;quot;800px&amp;quot;  # 设置宽度为 800 像素
---

正文内容...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your Hugo theme, locate or create the corresponding single-page template file (e.g., &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check if the page&amp;rsquo;s Front Matter contains &lt;code&gt;custom_width&lt;/code&gt; 参数，并将其应用到相应的 HTML 元素上，例如 &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; in single-page templates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34;&gt;{{ define &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; }}
  &amp;lt;div style=&amp;quot;max-width: {{ with .Params.custom_width }}{{ . }}{{ else }}100%{{ end }}; margin: 0 auto;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    {{ .Content }}
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we used inline styles to center the elements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that in practical applications, you may need to adjust the above examples according to your theme structure and CSS styles. Ensure consistency and readability when adjusting styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site&amp;rsquo;s custom &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; configuration was adjusted due to slight differences in the enabled theme&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>git-disable-http-repositories</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/git-disable-http-repositories/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 21:22:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/git-disable-http-repositories/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Accustomed to updating software versions, unsure which version&amp;rsquo;s repository to pull code from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;fatal: Unencrypted HTTP is not supported for GitLab. Ensure the repository remote URL is using HTTPS
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-introduction&#34;&gt;Background introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environment: Windows platform, consistently using TortoiseGit for Git operations, including configuring SSH keys. Previously attempted a script to batch update local repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous article link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When updating the code today, I encountered the previous error and the repository failed to update properly. I thought of updating the repository using &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0__应该提供了配置，让我继续使用__INLINE_CODE_1&lt;/strong&gt;, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the corresponding configuration item after searching around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest solution is, of course, to switch to the &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;协议来更新仓库，公司配置的&lt;code&gt;gitlab&lt;/code&gt;短期内不会提供&lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt;protocol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;outstanding-issues&#34;&gt;Outstanding issues
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When writing the batch update script for the local repository, I initially intended to use the &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0__的方式拉取仓库，也没细查是因为什么，通过小乌龟配置的__INLINE_CODE_1&lt;/strong&gt; configuration information, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t synchronized to the config, resulting in issues when executing via command line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git pull #提示没有权限，无法正常更新仓库
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking the key configuration via command is also correct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can successfully pull code using TortoiseGit but receive a &amp;ldquo;key incorrect&amp;rdquo; error when using the &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; command in the command line, this is likely because TortoiseGit uses PuTTY&amp;rsquo;s SSH key while the command line uses OpenSSH&amp;rsquo;s SSH key&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small turtle&amp;rsquo;s key configuration doesn&amp;rsquo;t read key file information from the system .ssh folder; instead, it configures the key file path separately when configuring the interface repository. A useful tip: configuring a key for the first repository being pulled allows other repositories to reuse this key file. After PuTTY loads the key, it doesn’t immediately exit but starts an agent service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adjusting the global configuration and not using the system default &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; setting, Git Bash will use TortoisePlink for SSH operations. This configuration is suitable when using the PuTTY tool that comes with TortoiseGit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git config --global core.sshCommand &amp;quot;&#39;C:/Program Files/TortoiseGit/bin/TortoisePlink.exe&#39; -batch -ssh&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modify the file path of the executable as needed to match your Little Turtle installation directory. Due to the full path configuration, no need to add it to system environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>AI programming and task decomposition</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/ai-programming-and-task-decomposition/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 08:44:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/ai-programming-and-task-decomposition/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I added a copy function for the site&amp;rsquo;s code area. It took nearly half a day, and the final rendering effect was not ideal. As an amateur front-end developer, I didn’t bother to improve it; as long as it worked, that was fine. This year, using &lt;strong&gt;INLIN_ITALIC_1&lt;/strong&gt;__, I developed a mini program and became more familiar with front-end development. So, I rebuilt it (AI redesign).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the Dao: Break down tasks into many smaller ones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;previous-text&#34;&gt;Previous text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are! Just paste the text here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design CSS and JavaScript code to locate webpage elements with the class &amp;ldquo;highlight&amp;rdquo;. Within the container of these elements, add a copy button that implements the functionality to copy the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial draft of the code had issues. A revised draft was generated, which is now basically functional, but contains incorrect copied content and redundant text. Further optimization is needed, including manual specification of core color design and effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand you have specific requirements for button size and color. We can redesign the button style to accommodate these needs. Here&amp;rsquo;s an adjusted CSS style, incorporating your provided color scheme and optimizing the button dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-css&#34;&gt;.copy-btn {
  position: absolute;
  top: 2px; /* 调整位置 */
  right: 2px;
  padding: 3px 6px; /* 缩小尺寸 */
  font-size: 12px; /* 减小字体大小 */
  background-color: #8FD1E1; /* 按钮背景色 */
  color: #272822; /* 文字颜色 */
  border: 1px solid #272822; /* 边框颜色 */
  border-radius: 3px; /* 圆角 */
  cursor: pointer;
  opacity: 0.7; /* 默认半透明 */
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease, background-color 0.3s ease; /* 平滑过渡效果 */
}

.copy-btn:hover {
  opacity: 1; /* 鼠标悬停时不透明 */
  background-color: #A3D4E5; /* 鼠标悬停时的背景色 */
}

.highlight {
  position: relative;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this style, I’ve reduced the button size and font to make it more refined. The default state is semi-transparent; hovering over the button makes it opaque with a slightly brighter background for visual feedback. This design meets your color requirements while maintaining a modern, user-friendly feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simpler version was provided accordingly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-JavaScript&#34;&gt;document.addEventListener(&#39;DOMContentLoaded&#39;, function() {
  // 查找所有 .highlight 元素
  const highlights = document.querySelectorAll(&#39;.highlight&#39;);

  highlights.forEach(function(highlight) {
    // 创建复制按钮
    const copyBtn = document.createElement(&#39;button&#39;);
    copyBtn.textContent = &#39;复制&#39;;
    copyBtn.classList.add(&#39;copy-btn&#39;);

    // 将按钮添加到每个 .highlight 元素中
    highlight.appendChild(copyBtn);

    // 添加点击事件监听器
    copyBtn.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function() {
      // 假设 .highlight 下的第一个 &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; 元素包含要复制的代码
      const code = highlight.querySelector(&#39;code&#39;) ? highlight.querySelector(&#39;code&#39;).textContent : &#39;&#39;;

      navigator.clipboard.writeText(code).then(() =&amp;gt; {
        // 显示复制成功信息
        copyBtn.textContent = &#39;已复制!&#39;;
        setTimeout(() =&amp;gt; {
          copyBtn.textContent = &#39;复制&#39;;
        }, 2000);
      }).catch(err =&amp;gt; {
        console.error(&#39;复制失败: &#39;, err);
      });
    });
  });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;d prefer a copy button added to the top right of the code area, due to my limited frontend knowledge, I haven’t been able to accurately describe the functionality with keywords, and several attempts have not yielded the desired result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s uncertain what impact &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; will have on program development as time progresses&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>East Meets West Controversy: A Clash of Culture and Commerce</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/dongfang-zhenxuan-essay-controversy-culture-vs-commerce/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 18:57:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/dongfang-zhenxuan-essay-controversy-culture-vs-commerce/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Select &amp;ldquo;Short Essay Incident&amp;rdquo; is a network controversy triggered by the company&amp;rsquo;s denial that Dong Yuhui was the author of all the short essays. The truth is now impossible to verify, and corporate power struggles have pushed this matter into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;seven-second memory&amp;rdquo; of fish is now entrusted to two options: the former provides more complete information, and search engines retrieve even more; however, the resulting blog posts are incomplete with a rigid format. The latter obtains content through keywords, which isn&amp;rsquo;t entirely comprehensive, but can generate complete blog post content. Providing reference URLs allows for optimization of the generated draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dong Yuhui/Oriental Selection incident is a dispute over copyright and authorship, beginning on December 5, 2023, involving interactions between the livestreamer Dong Yuhui and Oriental Selection. This controversy reveals the complexity of business operations and prompts deep reflection on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-5-2023-event-start&#34;&gt;December 5, 2023: Event Start
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Selection released a teaser video, and host Dong Yuhui&amp;rsquo;s recitation of a &amp;ldquo;short essay&amp;rdquo; quickly went viral&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongfang Zhenxuan stated in video comments that these short essays were mostly created by the copywriting team and not entirely written by Dong Yuhui&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-13-2023-dong-yu-huis-response&#34;&gt;December 13, 2023: Dong Yu Hui&amp;rsquo;s Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Yuhui published a lengthy article defending against stigmatizing anyone under the guise of &amp;ldquo;fancams&amp;rdquo; and clarifying his position on the matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-14-2023-managements-response&#34;&gt;December 14, 2023: Management&amp;rsquo;s Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Selection CEO Sun Dongxue released an apology video, admitting flaws in company management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Yuhui also received an apology from Dongfang Zhenxuan Chairman Yu Minhong, who responded to the incident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-16-2023-major-decision&#34;&gt;December 16, 2023: Major Decision
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongfang Zhenxuan has announced that Sun Dongxu is no longer CEO, with Yu Minhong assuming the role concurrently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the same day, Yu Minhong issued an apology letter stating that blacklisted viewers would be unblocked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dong-yu-huis-new-role&#34;&gt;Dong Yu Hui&amp;rsquo;s New Role
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XDF Education &amp;amp; Technology Group has appointed Dong Yuhui as Cultural Assistant to the Chairman of XDF Education &amp;amp; Technology Group, and concurrently Vice President of XDF Tourism Group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yu Minhong revealed that he will partner with Dong Yuhui to establish a studio and launch new live streaming accounts and rooms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-and-reflection&#34;&gt;Conclusion and Reflection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This controversy is not only a dispute over copyright and authorship but also reflects the clash between culture and commerce. In this era of digitization and fragmentation, the ownership of content creation has become a topic worthy of deep consideration. The Oriental Select &amp;ldquo;short essay&amp;rdquo; incident is more than just a media storm; it&amp;rsquo;s a profound reflection on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As observers, how should we view this collision of culture and commerce? While pursuing commercial interests, how can we protect and respect the creators&amp;rsquo; labor? These are questions worthy of deep reflection for each of us&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Game Psychology: Competitive Games</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-esports/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 10:26:22 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-esports/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pay-to-win games are not discussed here. Within the gaming community, they&amp;rsquo;re commonly called &amp;ldquo;money warriors.&amp;rdquo; It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require understanding game mechanics, just a thick wallet. Their enjoyment comes from being surrounded by sycophants and the thrill of dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular competitive games like League of Legends, Dota 2, Honor of Kings, and PlayerUnknown&amp;rsquo;s Battlegrounds have established complete world-building and thriving esports ecosystems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In game design, psychology is a crucial field, and social psychology particularly so. Understanding people&amp;rsquo;s behavior, needs, and motivations can help create more engaging game experiences. Regarding the relationship between &amp;ldquo;showing off&amp;rdquo; (装逼) and social psychology, we can consider it from several perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often seek a sense of belonging within social groups. In games, if the design allows players to feel exceptional in some way and attract attention from others, it can enhance their social identity. This may manifest as showing off skills or displaying earned rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some games incorporate social competition elements, encouraging players to showcase their achievements on social networks. This can be achieved through leaderboards, achievement systems, or multiplayer battles. Such designs stimulate a competitive spirit among players and may lead some to perform exceptionally well for social recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some games allow players to express themselves through customized characters and virtual items. This self-expression is not just about showing off; it can also be a way to communicate individuality and socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some games emphasize teamwork, achieving game objectives through social interaction. In these contexts, showing off is often discouraged, with a focus on collaboration and mutual support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game design can incorporate psychological reward systems to encourage players&amp;rsquo; positive social behavior. For example, offering rewards or privileges to incentivize active participation in social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, social psychology in game design can be used to shape player interactions and social experiences. While &amp;ldquo;showing off&amp;rdquo; behavior may exist in certain situations, game designers typically strive to balance it to ensure a positive and engaging experience for all players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing as I think of things, without a complete outline—a bit messy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author frequently plays League of Legends, a game that represents the shared memories of our generation. Most parents disapprove of their children playing, often due to a lack of understanding and experience with this type of game – partly attributable to the game&amp;rsquo;s design, which offers a fresh start each match. For many children, it’s a self-directed exploration without excessive thought. Success or failure in this mode largely depends on the child&amp;rsquo;s innate gaming talent. Based on my own observations, a significant portion of players fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost isn&amp;rsquo;t money, it&amp;rsquo;s time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game also features an entertainment mode to cater to casual players&amp;rsquo; needs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, League of Legends is more about fulfilling a long-held wish and experiencing the joy of comebacks. There are also many &amp;ldquo;armchair gamers&amp;rdquo; who don&amp;rsquo;t play the game anymore but still watch the World Championship every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unavoidable to mention &lt;strong&gt;。指的不是单局游戏的时间，而是你上号的时间，周末的下午、每天工作日的晚上七点到晚上十点之间，你会发现和队友大部分情况都能正常沟通，你发出去的信号，队友能理解，能收到回应。换到其他时间，比如说通宵游戏，你碰到的更多就是&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;，顺风的情况，无事发生，逆风的情况下，他们能问候你的全家，隔着屏幕你都能感受到那股子&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in the IT industry, I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to and played a lot of games across various genres. When it comes to competitive gaming, I’ve always relied on strategy rather than raw reflexes; my natural aptitude is there. Compared to professionals or younger players, my reaction time is slower. My preference is to lead teams—taking control and directing the game. I started playing back in school, when we were guided by the older members of our guild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gaming environment now is quite restless, lacking the purity of before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After advancing to a higher grade, playing high-level matches is truly exhausting. It requires constant intense focus, analyzing your opponent&amp;rsquo;s strategies and figuring out how to counter their traps – it’s the kind of experience where you don’t want to play another game afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being truly good at gaming isn&amp;rsquo;t impactful for life’s trajectory unless you pursue it professionally. It can serve as a social tool, but won&amp;rsquo;t provide a livelihood or allow you to establish yourself in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-player games and online games are two distinct types of games with significant differences in gameplay, experience, and technology. Here are some key aspects to understand the distinctions between them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This game is played locally on your device and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require an internet connection. Players can enjoy the experience without a network connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These games typically require an internet connection as players interact with each other in real-time. Online games can be cooperative or competitive, involving online socializing and competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players primarily interact with in-game AI, preset missions, or adversarial elements. The gaming experience is typically more personalized and influenced by the game&amp;rsquo;s design and narrative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players can interact with other real players from around the world. This may include cooperating on tasks, competing against or alongside each other, and social elements like chat and guild systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game design emphasizes providing a complete, self-contained narrative and game experience. Game content is typically pre-designed, with players exploring, solving puzzles, or engaging in combat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game design must consider real-time interaction and competition or collaboration among players. Game content may be more dynamic, including regular updates, online events, and social interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It typically runs offline and has relatively low requirements for device performance and internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires a strong internet connection and high demands on server and network performance to ensure smooth real-time interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typically employs a one-time purchase or download commercial model, allowing players to fully play the game on their local device after purchasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game may adopt various commercial models such as free play, advertising, in-app purchases, or subscriptions to maintain server operations and continuously update game content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these distinctions helps players clarify their preferences when choosing a game, and enables game designers to better meet player expectations&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Cloud server and script kiddie</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/cloud-servers-and-script-kids/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 15:08:53 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/cloud-servers-and-script-kids/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of the Double Eleven promotion, Alibaba Cloud recently acquired a server: an economical version for 99 yuan per year. The configuration isn&amp;rsquo;t high-end, but it’s suitable as a jump server proxying services for home use. The promotion lasts until 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I specifically chose a Shanghai server and proxied my home machine. It&amp;rsquo;s Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 (the server version was deployed later). When I tried to use it, I suddenly received an &amp;ldquo;access denied&amp;rdquo; message. I initially thought it was a server update that would resolve itself shortly. After five minutes, the login was still rejected. Searching for related errors indicated someone was attempting to log in and, due to too many incorrect password attempts, access is now disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered security attack scripts before, and immediately thought these logins are likely not legitimate – someone is attacking the service, attempting to brute-force the login server. The firewall configuration was convenient but lacked whitelisting; it proxied the 3389 ports of two machines, exposing them on the public network—like bait in a fishpond. Now that I know it&amp;rsquo;s a script kiddie attack, the next steps are simple: set up a firewall whitelist allowing access to the proxy service only from company and home IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proxy server previously lacked logging. Enabling it revealed a lot – proxy IPs from all over the country were attempting to log into my home server. Luckily, one was a server version, which alerted me to the issue. Otherwise, that Windows 11 machine would have been compromised eventually; the password was set too simply.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Batch update of local Git repository and legacy permission issues</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-repository-and-legacy-permission-issues/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 14:16:22 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-repository-and-legacy-permission-issues/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Projects within the team have dependencies; due to historical reasons and a lack of dependency management using &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;, developers must manually update repository code sequentially, or they may encounter various issues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referencing online resources, the structure is generally similar. Maintain a local repository directory: &lt;strong&gt;git_list.txt&lt;/strong&gt;. Write a script to traverse the directory and perform an update in one go; run the script before starting work each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;linux&#34;&gt;linux
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;create new file: batch_pull.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;#!/bin/bash

echo &amp;quot;============ 更新仓库 ===================&amp;quot;

# 检查 git_list.txt 是否存在
if [ ! -f &amp;quot;git_list.txt&amp;quot; ]; then
  echo &amp;quot;git_list.txt 文件不存在！请创建并添加要拉取的 git 仓库 URL。&amp;quot;
  exit 1
else
  echo &amp;quot;============ 检测到了 git 仓库清单文件 ====&amp;quot;
fi

# 逐行读取 git_list.txt 中的 URL，并执行拉取操作
while read -r url; do
  if [ -d &amp;quot;$url&amp;quot; ]; then
    cd &amp;quot;$url&amp;quot; || continue
    git pull
    cd ..
    echo &amp;quot;Pull $url 完成！&amp;quot;
    echo &amp;quot;========================================&amp;quot;
  else
    echo &amp;quot;目录 $url 不存在，跳过拉取。&amp;quot;
  fi
done &amp;lt; &amp;quot;git_list.txt&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;windows&#34;&gt;windows
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;create a new file: batch_pull.bat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dealing with a &lt;strong&gt;Fatal error&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Unsafe repository (&amp;rsquo;/home/repon&amp;rsquo; is owned by someone else)&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; after reinstalling the system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most online advice originates from &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding trusted directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manually modify the configuration file &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; to add a trusted directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;[safe]
    directory = /home/repon
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After addressing the issue, warehouse updates are now normal. However, each execution of __INLINE_CODE_0 console displays numerous warning messages indicating an owner error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reinstalling-windows-on-a-desktop-computer&#34;&gt;Reinstalling Windows on a desktop computer
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development machine hadn&amp;rsquo;t been reinstalled in a long time, resulting in a system disk overrun with junk files. I had to reinstall the system. Now I’m encountering this permission issue again; old scripts won&amp;rsquo;t run and the permissions are incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the new scheme, directly adding &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;，这样__INLINE_CODE_1__ will automatically trust all directories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;git config --global --add safe.directory &amp;quot;*&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s a user permissions issue or that people aren&amp;rsquo;t accustomed to the command, but I changed the folder owner. If you don’t have many directories, manually changing owners is also an option. However, this work computer has domain information added, so I’m not sure whether there’s an anomaly in the company’s deployed domain or a local system configuration issue. The user used for login couldn&amp;rsquo;t be found in the user list; ultimately, I resolved it using the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administrator privileges, run __INLINE_CODE_0__脚本__INLINE_CODE_1__BOLD_4&lt;code&gt;gbk&lt;/code&gt;, a Chinese operating system to avoid garbled characters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-powershell&#34;&gt;# 获取当前用户的用户名
$currentUserName = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name

# 设置 PowerShell 的字符编码为 UTF-8
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8

# 要更改所有者的根目录路径
$rootDirectory = &amp;quot;G:\workspace&amp;quot;  # 替换为实际的目录路径

# 递归遍历目录并更改文件和文件夹的所有者
Get-ChildItem -Path $rootDirectory -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    $itemPath = $_.FullName

    # 检查是文件还是文件夹
    if ($_ -is [System.IO.DirectoryInfo]) {
        # 如果是文件夹，使用 icacls 更改所有者权限
        $icaclsResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;已更改文件夹 $itemPath 的所有者为 $currentUserName&amp;quot;
        } else {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;无法更改文件夹 $itemPath 的所有者。错误信息: $icaclsResult&amp;quot;
        }
    } else {

        $takeownResult = icacls $itemPath /setowner &amp;quot;$currentUserName&amp;quot; 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            # Write-Host &amp;quot;已更改文件 $itemPath 的所有者为 $currentUserName&amp;quot;
        } else {
            Write-Host &amp;quot;无法更改文件 $itemPath 的所有者。错误信息: $takeownResult&amp;quot;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, something unexpected happened. The Chinese output from the script was garbled. I tried setting the console character encoding and adjusting the script&amp;rsquo;s encoding, but it remained gibberish. My thinking must have been off. I then tried enabling the beta feature in Control Panel - Region - Language settings and globally enabled Unicode encoding. The script ran normally, but several development software programs stopped working properly. Later, reviewing my notes, I realized I needed to adjust the script file&amp;rsquo;s encoding to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The bugs in the mini-program development weren&amp;rsquo;t fixed before a new one appeared. Recent company instability and inefficient communication during cross-location collaboration led to me taking on front-end development work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having grasped the fundamental framework, the path ahead will be less prone to deviation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously there was a [article/essay] suitable for experienced readers planning their learning path&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended reading for readers with no prior knowledge: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.wpfsoft.com/introduction&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WPF 中文网&lt;/a&gt;. It introduces fundamental concepts, historical development, and the cognitive logic of underlying classes from scratch. Interestingly, this website was just launched by the author in August this year, coinciding perfectly with our timeline. If it were any later, we likely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had a chance to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most authentic learning materials, of course it&amp;rsquo;s Microsoft’s official documentation. It can be dry, so new readers need to be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also many classic e-books, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really recommend them. With so much to handle in my daily work, I don’t have a lot of time for reading, and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get into the right mindset. Practicing with projects is more suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;c-and-net-release-history&#34;&gt;C# and .NET release history
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, there have been quite a few new features released, and the language&amp;rsquo;s version undergoes annual iteration&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The curtain-raising of financial anti-corruption</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Central Committee of the Communist Party: Efforts to combat corruption in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector must be intensified, and addressing the &amp;ldquo;four vices&amp;rdquo; should be deepened&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-politburo-of-the-communist-party-of-china&#34;&gt;The Politburo of the Communist Party of China
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held a meeting on September 27 to review a comprehensive report on the first round of inspections during the CPC’s 20th Central Committee term. General Secretary Xi Jinping presided over the meeting. The meeting emphasized leveraging the outcomes of the inspections to further strengthen the Party&amp;rsquo;s overall leadership, urging inspected organizations to enhance their political awareness and diligently fulfill responsibilities entrusted by the CPC Central Committee. It also stressed continuously strengthening the core functions and competitiveness of state-owned enterprises, solidifying the essential material and political foundations of socialism with Chinese characteristics, increasing the efforts of financial institutions in serving the real economy and national strategies, and promoting high-quality development. The meeting called for balancing development and security, establishing a baseline and extreme mindset, taking effective measures to prevent and resolve major risks, and firmly safeguarding the safety bottom line. It urged advancing the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party, tightening responsibility for Party committee secretaries as primary responsible persons, implementing “one post, two responsibilities” for members of leadership bodies, strengthening oversight responsibilities of disciplinary and supervisory organs, and intensifying supervision over leading figures at all levels. Efforts should be increased to combat corruption in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector, address issues related to &amp;ldquo;formality over substance,&amp;rdquo; and promote integrated prevention and cure through case-driven reform. The meeting also emphasized implementing the Party’s organizational principles for a new era, strengthening leadership team construction, cadre and talent development, and grassroots party organization building. It called for comprehensively utilizing the results of inspections to deepen reforms, improve systems, advance source governance, and achieve both fundamental and immediate improvements. (Xinhua)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Bank, Liu Liange, Expelled from the Party Amidst Significant Financial Risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and National Supervisory Commission, with the approval of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, Liu Liange, former party secretary and chairman of Bank of China, is under investigation for serious violations of discipline and law
After investigation, Liu Liange lost his ideals and beliefs, abandoned his original aspirations and mission, failed to resolutely implement the decisions and plans of the Party Central Committee, neglected his responsibilities in financial risk prevention and control, extensively interfered with credit projects in violation of regulations, illegally disbursed loans, creating major financial risks. He performed poorly in fulfilling the principal responsibility for strict governance on all fronts, severely damaged the political environment within his unit, secretly brought prohibited publications into the country, and deliberately resisted organizational inspections. He disregarded the spirit of the Central Eight-Point Regulation, accepting gifts and cash, entering private clubs, and receiving ski and travel arrangements; he long-term borrowed vehicles belonging to those he managed. He failed to report personal matters as required, provided false information during organizational inquiries, and improperly appointed, adjusted, or promoted cadres. He engaged in commercial activities illegally, intervened in lending and borrowing against regulations, and retained classified materials. His morals were corrupt, his family conduct was improper, and he failed to properly guide and educate his relatives. Demonstrating no legal bottom line, he abused his power for personal gain, “profiting from the financial sector,” using his position to seek benefits for others in areas such as loan financing and project cooperation, and illegally accepting large sums of money and property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu Liange seriously violated political, organizational, integrity, work, and lifestyle discipline. His actions constituted serious official misconduct and involved suspected bribery and illegal loan disbursement crimes. He showed no signs of restraint or correction after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, demonstrating a severe nature and detrimental impact. In accordance with regulations including the &amp;ldquo;Disciplinary Action Regulations of the Communist Party of China,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;Law on Supervision of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China,&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Regulations on Administrative Punishment of Civil Servants,&amp;rdquo; following deliberation by the Standing Committee of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and approval by the Communist Party of China Central Committee, it was decided to impose the disciplinary action of expulsion from the Party. His entitled benefits will be revoked; his delegate status for the 20th National Congress of the CPC is terminated; all gains from his violations and crimes will be confiscated; and the suspected criminal cases have been transferred to the procuratorial organ for legal review and prosecution, along with related assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Xiaopeng, former Party Secretary and Chairman of China CITIC Group, has been removed from his party membership and public office due to serious violations of discipline and law. (CCTV News)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Zhi, former Party Secretary and Chairman of Guizhou Bank, is currently under disciplinary review and investigation by the Guizhou Provincial Supervisory Commission due to suspected serious violations of discipline and law&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;huijin-increases-its-stake-in-the-four-largest-banks-after-eight-years&#34;&gt;Huijin increases its stake in the four largest banks after eight years
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 11th, China&amp;rsquo;s four largest state-owned commercial banks – Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and Construction Bank – announced that Huijin Capital increased their holdings by 27.61 million shares, 37.27 million shares, 24.89 million shares, and 18.38 million shares respectively; Huijin Capital plans to continue increasing its stake in the four banks on the secondary market within the next six months&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Monetization Model: Raffles/Sweepstakes</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/traffic-monetization-business-models-lottery/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 07:04:35 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Host giveaways of iPhones? Mini-program ranking rewards? Various live streaming platform gift lotteries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seemingly unrelated things are, in essence, different monetization models for free traffic, with a hint of financial engineering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;win-gifts-through-platform-lottery&#34;&gt;Win gifts through platform lottery
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typical scenarios, users obtain platform currency to purchase gifts for their favorite streamers. Platforms also offer another approach: instead of directly gifting, users can spend the acquired currency to enter raffles and win exclusive, high-value gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s already a problem – online lotteries are essentially platforms running casinos. With enough participants, they’re guaranteed to be profitable. &lt;strong&gt;屌丝&lt;/strong&gt; Users participate hoping for a big win, intending to show off and gain status!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gift-from-streamer-physical-item&#34;&gt;Gift from streamer (physical item)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform&amp;rsquo;s lottery focuses on user content. Hosts have monthly activity and popularity tasks. Enabling the gifting lottery allows fans who send designated gifts or amounts to participate, with prizes like high-end phones or cash rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For popular streamers, this event is quite profitable – essentially a zero-cost purchase with enough participants to generate income. It tests the streamer&amp;rsquo;s operational skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s another way to play—with high rewards (cash value)—and many outdoor streamers use this method, essentially a form of online gambling. People don’t care about the content; users only care if they can win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from show-focused hosts, ordinary game streamers struggle to drive player spending through PK mode. Gaming and watching streams are leisure activities; people don&amp;rsquo;t typically want to spend extra money. Especially lotteries can cultivate users’ charging habits and consumption habits, occasionally leading to impulse purchases (with generous prizes, creating a desire to win).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mini-program-ranking-rewards&#34;&gt;Mini-program ranking rewards
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design a mini-program with trivial processes or offer limited gaming support. These are all cover tactics to pass Tencent&amp;rsquo;s review; the gameplay should include a ranking system. Users earn points by viewing incentivized ads and completing tasks, and the backend uses these points to determine rankings. High-ranking users receive designated rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core logic: Advertising revenue &amp;gt; Operating costs + Reward expenses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even small programs can operate effectively, providing reasonable services and earning income through appropriate advertising. The earnings may not be substantial, but a steady trickle can still work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ZeroTier for Remote Local Area Networks</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/zero-tier-remote-lan/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 04:58:03 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Acquired a new __INLINE_CODE_0__主机，想着配置配置环境方便，在家偶尔也有访问的需求，临时部署内网穿透。按照以往的经验，部署__INLINE_CODE_1__服务，指定端口转发，需要一台公网的服务器，连接的质量取决于公网服务器的宽带质量。折腾一点新鲜的__INLINE_CODE_2__虚拟机局域网，类似于&lt;code&gt;VPN&lt;/code&gt; in the office, created a virtual network card locally, and added all machines to a virtual network&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-zerotier&#34;&gt;What is ZeroTier?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can easily connect multiple computers, servers, and devices to a virtual, encrypted network as if they were on the same local area network. This allows programmers and IT professionals to securely share data and resources between different locations without complex network setups or VPN configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZeroTier Network is a virtual, global local area network that allows different devices to connect together over the internet as if they were on the same physical network. This network can include multiple subnets, with all devices connected through ZeroTier&amp;rsquo;s technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planet servers are key components of the ZeroTier network. They are global in scope, responsible for maintaining and managing the entire ZeroTier network&amp;rsquo;s topology, routing information, and network status. Planet servers act as a global network control center but do not directly transmit data. User devices need to connect to at least one planet server to participate in the ZeroTier network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relay servers are auxiliary nodes in the Zerotier network, helping devices establish direct communication channels. When devices cannot connect directly, they can transmit data through a relay server, improving network reachability and performance. Relay servers are typically located worldwide, acting as data transfer hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Zerotier creates virtual local area networks globally, enabling secure and fast communication between devices through planetary and relay servers. Planetary servers manage the global network, while relay servers help establish connections when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation-deployment&#34;&gt;Installation Deployment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the ZeroTier official website (link) for installation files and documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install the ZeroTier One client for your operating system. It supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and many other platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch the ZeroTier One client after installation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a ZeroTier account if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have one. You can create an account within the client.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in to your ZeroTier account and create a new network. The network will have a unique 16-character ID that you need to remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join this network on your device. You can enter the network ID in the client or use the QR code scanning function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devices installed with and configured with the ZeroTier client will be added to the same virtual network. These devices can now communicate directly, as if they were on the same local area network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can manage network settings, add devices, and monitor network traffic through ZeroTier&amp;rsquo;s control panel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-deployment-moon&#34;&gt;Install deployment moon
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many domestic carriers prohibit this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;curl -s https://install.zerotier.com/ | sudo bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify installation success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;zerotier-cli info
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join local network&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;zerotier-cli join network-id
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;cd /var/lib/zerotier-one &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo zerotier-idtool initmoon identity.public &amp;gt; moon.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit the configuration file, adjust the __INLINE_CODE_0 node, &amp;ldquo;public server IP/9993&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate signature configuration, create &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; folder, move existing files here, and restart the service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo zerotier-idtool genmoon moon.json
mkdir moons.d &amp;amp;&amp;amp; mv 000000eb444ec0d8.moon moons.d/
systemctl restart zerotier-one.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client nodes join the Moon server; their ID is taken from the ID field in the preceding JSON configuration file&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;peers&lt;/code&gt; subcommand displays connections, and &lt;code&gt;listpeers&lt;/code&gt; shows all nodes. Nodes marked as &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; indicate successful joining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, everything was already uninstalled. When the server arrived, there were no suitable service agents available. To boost sales, Alibaba Cloud offered a developer-exclusive server with modest specs and an affordable price of $99 per year.

        <title>VMware virtual machine disk space optimization</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-disk-space-optimization/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 18:35:41 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/vmware-virtual-disk-space-optimization/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When installing a development system on a virtual machine, it&amp;rsquo;s common to reserve extra disk space. Over time, the local storage consumed far exceeds the actual content of the virtual machine files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scene-description&#34;&gt;Scene description
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The command showed the disk usage was 60GB. After deleting all snapshots and clones, the local virtual machine still occupies significantly more than 60GB, exacerbating the already limited disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34;&gt;Prerequisites
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The virtual machine installation did not select pre-allocated disk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The local disk where the virtual machine is stored has more free space than the virtual machine currently occupies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining space is insufficient; consider temporarily moving the virtual machine to an external drive, then migrating it back after disk optimization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An official package is provided, which can be installed via yum or a VMware Tools image package&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;orders&#34;&gt;Orders
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;vmware-toolbox-cmd disk shrink /
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After execution, the virtual machine will automatically shut down, and the VMware host program will perform disk compression. The execution time depends on the size of the virtual machine and the speed of the disk access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The execution effect is still very good; the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s disk space usage essentially matches the disk information of &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Stable Diffusion – A Saga of Installation Troubles</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/stable-diffusion-zero-install-saga/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Domestic resources generally recommend &lt;strong&gt;秋叶&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s one-click deployment package. Assuming they are based on &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; open-source projects, the deployment shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too complex; let&amp;rsquo;s try starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After messing around with AI-generated images, I specially replaced my graphics card, only to have it gloriously shut down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core encryption remains inactive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pending&#34;&gt;Pending
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restructure the article, first introducing PyTorch, version compatibility, and how to check versions
How to create a new virtual environment from scratch and deploy PyTorch locally

&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps&#34;&gt;Steps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not find a step-by-step installation tutorial by searching in Chinese. Then, you just download the repository and run the script with a double click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For detailed usage instructions and FAQs, please refer to &lt;code&gt;issues&lt;/code&gt;，&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why no one explained what this repository is for. Actually, it’s not hard to tell from the name—it&amp;rsquo;s an interface console that makes it more convenient to use. In fact, during installation, it will download the official repository content and obtain the actual &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warehouse also includes an installation startup script that automatically detects the presence of &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;虚拟环境。如果有的话默认使用当前路径的的&lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; in the current folder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a complete beginner, it is recommended that you check out: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://stable-diffusion-art.com/install-windows/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://stable-diffusion-art.com/install-windows/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pytorch&#34;&gt;pytorch
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I wanted to say today: First, don&amp;rsquo;t just run the script directly based on their instructions. Python installs dependencies through requirement files – that’s a minor issue. The core thing is your graphics card driver version needs to correspond with PyTorch. Many resources online explain this relationship; you can easily find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40660408/article/details/129896700&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40660408/article/details/129896700&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a virtual environment first—an empty one—allows you to directly run the script from the official website to install PyTorch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;python -c &amp;quot;import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;python -c &amp;quot;import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available())&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two scripts can check your CUDA version and whether the installation was successful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not recommended to use complicated operations here. Just copy the logic from the official page and install it directly. Installing via pip may result in failure or CUDA activation issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important: Ensure the folder path is clean; otherwise, PyTorch may not work properly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It involved numerous installations and attempts to manually install the official files. The goal was to upgrade to version 2.0, as the official documentation states it offers improved speed. However, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the software and unsure if the Python version or other factors were influencing performance. I also consulted the official manual, which recommends using version 3.8. This created a conflict since a previous one-click deployment package used version 3.10. Ultimately, I started from scratch: creating a new folder, establishing a virtual environment, and ensuring torch was successfully installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then move this installed virtual environment into the web UI folder. Starting the installation script again at this point should resolve most dependency issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After moving, you need to run: python -m pip install &amp;ndash;upgrade &amp;ndash;force-reinstall pip to fix it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might seem odd, but I spent a while troubleshooting this. It couldn&amp;rsquo;t correctly identify my torch, so to eliminate all potential interference, I decided to install it first, before installing other dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;xformers&#34;&gt;Xformers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommended to enable; accelerates image generation and reduces current usage. Side effect: same parameter group, &lt;strong&gt;生成的图像相对不是那么稳定&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s better to recommend the one-click deployment package. However, that package contains some custom settings from the author, which differ from the official, original version. If you’re a beginner, you might not understand why it’s best to start with the official parameters. As you gain experience, refer to the official documentation to learn which parameters need adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the cryptocurrency mining boom, graphics card prices are relatively lower now. For ordinary entry-level players, the amount of VRAM is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;strong&gt;高清放大&lt;/strong&gt; options require more detailed implementation, enriching screen details and demanding more video memory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months, I intended to review the installation steps and explain more basic concepts. However, it turns out that for ordinary people using AI image generation, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly about adjusting parameters based on images provided by experts or re-rendering existing images in a formatted way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried using AI to generate UI assets for a mini-program, but after all that effort, the results were unsatisfactory. It&amp;rsquo;s better to just pull resources directly from the official mini-program.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Optimize your code; dont fight the hardware</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/program-optimization-dont-fight-hardware/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the microsecond level, replacing the server reduced packet backlog from a maximum of 60,000 to almost none&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In single-threaded data processing, CPU performance depends on factors such as clock speed, cache size, and instruction set architecture. Generally, CPUs with higher clock speeds, larger caches, and more advanced instruction set architectures offer better performance in single-threaded scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;single-threaded&#34;&gt;Single-threaded
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance improvements don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily require increasing threads. Streamline project workflows, identify bottlenecks, and determine if single-threading is sufficient. Single-threading also involves fewer considerations and is less prone to issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting off by talking about adding threads, there&amp;rsquo;s definitely something wrong with that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked overtime all night, released a new optimized version. Local interface stripping tests are okay, with a TPS of 42,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployed to the server, TPS plummeted: 21,000. Tried on my desktop at home, TPS: 79,000. Starting to suspect there might be an issue with the group&amp;rsquo;s service virtual machines, likely related to CPU frequency. The biggest difference between my desktop and the server &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; is the CPU frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding core count and clock speed, the Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4807 @ 1.87GHz has 6 physical cores and 12 logical cores with a clock speed of 1.87GHz; while the Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 v3 @ 2.60GHz has 8 physical cores and 16 logical cores with a clock speed of 2.60GHz. Therefore, in terms of core count and clock speed, the E5-2640 v3 should have an advantage over the E7-4807 when processing data on a single thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding cache size, the E7-4807 has 12MB compared to the E5-2640 v3&amp;rsquo;s 20MB. Consequently, the E5-2640 v3 offers greater cache space, potentially improving data access speed and cache hit rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, regarding architecture, the E5-2640 v3 uses the more advanced Haswell architecture, while the E7-4807 utilizes the older Nehalem architecture. The Haswell architecture offers performance improvements over Nehalem, which may positively impact the E5-2640 v3&amp;rsquo;s single-thread data processing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, considering all factors, in a single-threaded data processing scenario, the E5-2640 v3 should offer better performance than the E7-4807. However, specific performance differences will be influenced by various factors such as data processing algorithms, memory bandwidth, and system load; analysis must be tailored to each situation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as we learned techniques for using search engines, we also need to learn communication skills – providing reasonable and sufficient constraints to efficiently obtain the answers we need&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at it from a different angle, the current situation will generate the desired result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;science-communication&#34;&gt;Science communication
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a deep learning model trained on publicly available internet data, used for tasks like question answering, text summarization, machine translation, classification, code generation, and conversational AI. There are currently various versions of GPT, including GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4, each larger and more powerful than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-intelligence-truly-exist&#34;&gt;Does intelligence truly exist?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The higher the similarity, the greater the accuracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic, repetitive tasks no longer require human intervention after specific training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is a technology that utilizes existing data such as text, audio, and images to create new content. It can be applied to various tasks including text generation, speech synthesis, image generation, and conversational systems. The logic of generative AI depends on its training data and model structure. Generally, it can follow grammar, logic, and common sense to a certain extent, but may also produce errors, biases, or inaccurate information. Therefore, the output of generative AI requires human judgment and verification; it should not be blindly trusted or used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt-engineer&#34;&gt;prompt-engineer
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river of time doesn&amp;rsquo;t flow backward; people need to learn to adapt to the trend. You can consider &lt;em&gt;[INLIN]&lt;/em&gt; as unintelligent and lacking logic, often producing unusable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at it from a different angle, the current situation will generate the desired result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dialogue-mode&#34;&gt;Dialogue mode
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, [something] dramatically emerged, allowing humanity to recognize the capabilities of large language models&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;strong&gt;基于注释的编程&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;基于对话的编程&lt;/strong&gt;, the interactive logic is completely different; the dialogue pattern offers a user-friendly experience for novice users. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to mention &lt;code&gt;NewBing&lt;/code&gt;在每个问题之后，给出的追问提示，微软在尝试引导用户，获取&lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; within the knowledge base, with more content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;for-example&#34;&gt;For example
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long journey on high-speed rail; coding is a good option. With limited data, processing a few images and obtaining image resources is manageable, but downloading software to process them is a bit of a luxury given the network conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A batch of image assets with transparent backgrounds are needed for a mini-program navigation bar. Selected states should be colored, unselected states black and white. The assets are currently in color and require preprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a Python code snippet that reads all images from a folder, converts them to grayscale, preserves transparency, optimizes image quality and reduces file size upon saving, and displays the comparison of file sizes before and after optimization in the console&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# 导入必要的库
import os
import PIL
from PIL import Image

# 定义一个函数，将图片转换成黑白，维持透明背景，保存图片，并返回文件体积
def convert_and_save(image_file):
    # 打开图片
    image = Image.open(image_file)
    # 获取图片的模式，如果是 RGBA 模式，说明有透明背景
    mode = image.mode
    if mode == &amp;quot;RGBA&amp;quot;:
        # 创建一个和图片大小一致的白色背景图片
        background = Image.new(&amp;quot;RGB&amp;quot;, image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        # 将原图片粘贴到白色背景上，忽略透明像素
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
        # 将合成的图片转换成灰度模式
        gray_image = background.convert(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
        # 将灰度图片再转换成 RGBA 模式，以便保留透明背景
        final_image = gray_image.convert(&amp;quot;RGBA&amp;quot;)
    else:
        # 如果不是 RGBA 模式，直接将图片转换成灰度模式
        final_image = image.convert(&amp;quot;L&amp;quot;)
    # 获取原图片的文件名和扩展名
    file_name, file_ext = os.path.splitext(image_file)
    # 定义新图片的文件名，添加 _bw 后缀表示黑白
    new_file_name = file_name + &amp;quot;_bw&amp;quot; + file_ext
    # 保存新图片，并优化质量，减少文件体积
    final_image.save(new_file_name, optimize=True)
    # 获取原图片和新图片的文件体积，并返回
    old_size = os.path.getsize(image_file)
    new_size = os.path.getsize(new_file_name)
    return old_size, new_size

# 定义一个文件夹路径，存放所有的图片
folder_path = &amp;quot;images&amp;quot;
# 遍历文件夹中的所有文件
for file in os.listdir(folder_path):
    # 拼接完整的文件路径
    file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file)
    # 判断是否是图片文件，根据扩展名判断，可以根据需要添加或修改扩展名
    if file_path.endswith((&amp;quot;.png&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.jpg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.jpeg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.gif&amp;quot;)):
        # 调用函数，转换并保存图片，并获取文件体积
        old_size, new_size = convert_and_save(file_path)
        # 在控制台展示优化前后的文件体积大小对比
        print(f&amp;quot;{file}: {old_size} bytes -&amp;gt; {new_size} bytes&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly provided an answer, looks good, and works fine. Experienced programmers will find the code lacks generality and isn&amp;rsquo;t suitable for production environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parameters fixed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No log files; information is printed to the console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image processing tasks are well-suited for multithreaded models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there any improvements that can be made to this code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This answer, frankly, far exceeded expectations. It provides suggestions for optimizations that even a typical programmer would consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;这段代码可能还有一些可以改进的地方，比如：

可以使用 argparse 库，让用户可以通过命令行参数指定文件夹路径和扩展名，而不是写死在代码里。
可以使用 logging 库，记录程序的运行情况，而不是直接打印到控制台。
可以使用 try-except 语句，捕获可能出现的异常，比如文件打开失败，图片转换失败等，并做相应的处理。
可以使用 multiprocessing 库，利用多核处理器，加速图片的转换和保存过程。
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friendly response, considering deployment environments may vary, supporting only single-process execution is permitted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;当然，我很乐意帮你修改一下代码。我尝试添加了 argparse, logging 和 try-except 语句，但没有添加 multiprocessing 库，因为我不确定你的电脑是否支持多核处理。修改后的代码如下：
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>WeChat Mini Program Background and Development Environment</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/wechat-mini-program-background-and-development-environment/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 21:59:11 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/wechat-mini-program-background-and-development-environment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction to and Preparation for WeChat Mini Programs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-wechat-mini-programs-exist&#34;&gt;Why do WeChat mini programs exist?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved experience: Slow loading of embedded webpages, blank screens; Native app experiences offer faster loading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standards and Management: For WeChat, accessing and managing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the release of mini-programs, WeChat launched a &lt;em&gt;bold_italicized&lt;/em&gt; feature exposing its native capabilities—WeChat Pay and Wechat Cards. However, developers used web development languages, allowing them to bypass some of WeChat&amp;rsquo;s regulations. Mini-programs have their own descriptive language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-mini-program&#34;&gt;What is a mini program?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mini-programs are applications that can be used without needing to be downloaded or installed, realizing the dream of app &lt;strong&gt;触手可及&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can open the application by scanning a QR code or searching, which also embodies the &lt;strong&gt;用完即走&lt;/strong&gt; concept&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;unobtrusive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-difference-between-mini-programs-and-mobile-apps&#34;&gt;The difference between mini-programs and mobile apps
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No installation, no memory usage, easy sharing: Scan code, mini-program card, search&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-mini-programs-do&#34;&gt;What can mini programs do?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content Tools: Zhihu Trending, Weibo Hot Topics, Mobike, Jinri Toutiao, Tencent Map, Tencent Translate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retail: Pinduoduo, JD Shopping, Mogujie, Meili Fresh, Xiaomi Mall, Watson&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games: Jump, Happy Landlord, Happy Mahjong, Douyu Live Streaming, YY Live Streaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course content is from 2018, and some of the applications mentioned have since closed down&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;development-preparation&#34;&gt;Development preparation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register for a mini-program account: Fill in the information as required, then click the activation link in your email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in to the Mini Program Management Console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete mini-program information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binding Developer: Individual developers – the WeChat account used for login is the administrator account, no additional binding is required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email addresses have limitations, so a new one is needed. However, &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; email allows for aliases, and WeChat&amp;rsquo;s backend doesn’t verify them. I tried it out; the mini-program name was tricky, but anything involving trademarks easily fails review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service categories can be selected or customized, with up to five categories per mini-program&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view information about the mini-program and enable message push within settings. Enabling message push allows you to use message templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;developer-tools-a-personal-account&#34;&gt;Developer Tools (A Personal Account)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal download and installation, no special notes. Briefly understand, enter directly in visitor mode. To enable phone debugging (viewing the development version of the mini-program), log in to the mini-program developer account and then click settings, switching to the specified mini-program within project details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-structure&#34;&gt;Code structure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JS: Interaction logic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON: Data Configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

        <title>Office relocation, servers are inaccessible</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/office-migration-server-unavailable/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 01:42:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/office-migration-server-unavailable/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Office relocation notice: Moving from the second floor to the fifteenth floor, a routine desk move&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;design-sense&#34;&gt;Design sense
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;migration&#34;&gt;Migration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packing up and moving on, setting up my new workstation – adjusting cables and finding a comfortable posture before starting work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no! The internet connection is up, but I can&amp;rsquo;t access the usual servers in our group. Switching to Wi-Fi works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought it was a server network segment issue. The new workstation&amp;rsquo;s wired network wasn’t in the firewall configuration, so I figured an IT colleague could adjust it. However, this network segment hosts multiple servers, and accessing others worked fine, which raised my suspicions. Professional matters should be handled by professionals; eventually, the operations team identified the problem: the server deployed &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt;，服务的默认网络__INLINE_CODE_1__和办公室有线网络配置的网段冲突了，导致发过去的数据包，都收不到应答，被路由给了__INLINE_CODE_2__ services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not unusual for addresses starting with &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0__服务，也就这台，我比较常用，偶尔用容器部署一些测试服务，没想到还能碰到这个场景。后来细想想，由于整个集团都在一个办公大楼里面，IT部门的同事划分网段，用到了__INLINE_CODE_1&lt;/strong&gt; to not be deployed on other servers&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Embedded Systems: Introduction 1 - Professional Terminology</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/embedded-introduction-professional-terms/</link>

        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/embedded-introduction-professional-terms/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mentioning embedded systems, I still think of the 51 microcontroller and Freescale from my school lab days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LPA3399Pro is a visual host system developed on the Rockchip RK3399Pro platform, designed for portable computing in scenarios requiring extensive vision processing. It features an integrated NPU unit with 3.0 TOPS of computing power and supports various algorithm models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RV1109 is a SoC from Realtek Semiconductor&amp;rsquo;s AI-driven machine vision branch, featuring an integrated NPU. It offers 1 TOPS of computing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;system-on-chip&#34;&gt;System on Chip
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoC is an abbreviation for &amp;ldquo;System on a Chip,&amp;rdquo; referring to a technology that integrates multiple electronic systems onto a single chip. This reduces the size and weight of electronic products while improving performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoCs (System on a Chip) and CPUs (Central Processing Units) are both important components of computer systems, but they have some differences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPU is the core processor in a computer system, responsible for executing program instructions. It typically consists of basic components such as an arithmetic unit, control unit, and registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System-on-a-Chip (SoC) integrates multiple electronic systems onto a single chip, including components like CPU, memory, graphics processors, and input/output interfaces. This reduces the size and weight of electronic products while improving performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the CPU is a component of the SoC, while the SoC is a more complex and highly integrated electronic system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;microcontroller-unit&#34;&gt;Microcontroller Unit
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both SoCs (Systems on a Chip) and MCUs (Microcontrollers) integrate multiple electronic systems onto a single chip, but they differ in several ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MCU (Microcontroller Unit) typically includes basic components such as a CPU, memory, and input/output interfaces. It is commonly used to control other electronic devices like home appliances and automotive electronics systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System-on-Chip (SoC) integrates more electronic systems onto a single chip, including basic MCU components and additional elements like graphics processors and wireless communication modules. This significantly reduces the size and weight of electronic products while improving performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, an MCU is a simple microcontroller, while a SoC is a more complex, highly integrated electronic system&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>AI-assisted programming, an evolution of productivity</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/ai-assisted-programming-productivity-evolution/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 17:05:17 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/ai-assisted-programming-productivity-evolution/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; 发布也不到两年时间，&lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_1&lt;/strong&gt; was released, and I don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand the underlying principles, but I’ve been using them for a while. The two tools offer completely different levels of assistance, but both significantly improve productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For overly complex matters, the effect can only be about nine-tenths successful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-copilot&#34;&gt;github copilot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it was released, the website description &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t seem very smart, and after trying it out, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very usable, so I gave up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before 2022, out of boredom, I switched to the new version for a try. The results are already pretty good, though the speed is slow in China, likely due to network issues. Code generated based on comments like &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt; is quite decent and much faster than researching and writing it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chatgpt&#34;&gt;ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still designing products from a programmer&amp;rsquo;s, or development, perspective. You need to understand how to code and gradually guide AI-assisted programming through comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let non-experts quickly get started. The conversational, interactive design allows you to ask questions, describe your needs, and continue asking if anything is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you understand the concept of tokenization but don&amp;rsquo;t know how to code it, and want to calculate string similarity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;Python 分词计算 維天運通 LOGORY 和 合肥維天運通信息科技股份有限公司 两个字符串的相似度；
比较前，统一处理字符串，英文转换为小写；
第二个字符中如果能找到第一个字符的首字符，将第二个字符串截位，截位的长度为第一个字符串的长度
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, this is Bing. 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to online information, Python tokenization can be implemented using the jieba library. Jieba supports three modes: precise mode, full mode, and search engine mode. You can choose the appropriate mode based on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare the similarity of two strings, you first need to tokenize them and then calculate indicators such as word vectors or edit distance. You can use libraries like NumPy or SciPy for mathematical operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To uniformly handle strings, converting them to lowercase can be achieved using Python&amp;rsquo;s built-in &lt;code&gt;lower()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extract the second string, you can use Python&amp;rsquo;s slicing operator []&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a possible code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import jieba
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

# 定义两个字符串
str1 = &amp;quot;維天運通 LOGORY&amp;quot;
str2 = &amp;quot;合肥維天運通信息科技股份有限公司&amp;quot;

# 统一处理字符串，英文转换为小写
str1 = str1.lower()
str2 = str2.lower()

# 找到第二个字符串中第一个字符的位置
index = str2.find(str1[0])

# 如果找到了，截取第二个字符串
if index != -1:
    str2 = str2[index:index+len(str1)]

# 使用 jieba 库进行分词
words1 = list(jieba.cut(str1))
words2 = list(jieba.cut(str2))

# 计算两个字符串的词向量（以词频作为权重）
vector1 = np.zeros(len(words1))
vector2 = np.zeros(len(words1))

for i, word in enumerate(words1):
    vector1[i] += 1 # 统计第一个字符串中每个词出现的次数
    if word in words2:
        vector2[i] += 1 # 统计第二个字符串中每个词出现的次数

# 计算两个字符串的相似度（以余弦距离作为指标）
similarity = 1 - cosine(vector1, vector2)

print(&amp;quot;两个字符串的相似度是：&amp;quot;, similarity)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chestnut&#34;&gt;Chestnut
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find all records from the product code table where the product codes are within the range of 80000-89999&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;你好，这是 Bing。😊

根据搜索结果12，你可以使用 SQL BETWEEN 运算符来选择给定区间内的值。BETWEEN 运算符包含了开始和结束的值。

你需要先指定要查询的表名和列名，然后在 WHERE 子句中使用 BETWEEN 运算符和区间值。

例如，如果你要查询产品代码表中，产品代码在 80000 到 89999 之间的记录，你可以使用以下语句：

SELECT * FROM product_code
WHERE code BETWEEN 80000 AND 89999;
这里，* 表示选择所有列3。如果你只想选择特定的列，比如产品名称和价格，你可以用逗号分隔它们，如下：

SELECT name, price FROM product_code
WHERE code BETWEEN 80000 AND 89999;
希望这能帮助到你。
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep asking, deny it: The product code is a string, your code is wrong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;抱歉，我没有注意到产品代码是字符串。如果是这样的话，你需要在区间值两边加上单引号，如下：

SELECT * FROM product_code
WHERE code BETWEEN &#39;80000&#39; AND &#39;89999&#39;;
请原谅我的错误。🙏
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, it will be wrong&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Hong Kong dollar and Renminbi dual counter service</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/hk-rmb-dual-counter-mode/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 20:25:47 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/hk-rmb-dual-counter-mode/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing announced on December 13th that its securities market will launch a &amp;ldquo;dual currency trading model&amp;rdquo; (hereinafter referred to as the “dual counter model”) and a dual counter designated participant mechanism, further supporting Renminbi counter listings, trading, and settlement in Hong Kong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dual-counter-model-and-dual-counter-bookmaker-mechanism&#34;&gt;Dual counter model and dual counter bookmaker mechanism
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) stated that, pending regulatory approval and market readiness, the registration process for new measures is expected to begin in the first half of 2023. Under the dual-counter model, HKEX will optimize trading and settlement arrangements to allow investors to switch between Hong Kong dollar and Renminbi counter securities issued by the same entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enhance liquidity and narrow the spread in its Renminbi trading counters, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing will introduce a dual counter dealing mechanism. Following legislative approval, market makers engaging in volume supply activities may be exempt from stamp duty on specific transactions. These measures also aim to prepare for future Mainland investors pricing securities via Stock Connect with RMB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of a Hong Kong dollar-RMB dual counter model and dual counter market maker mechanism is an important step in our market development. Coupled with other market initiatives, this arrangement will help attract more dual-counter securities to list in Hong Kong and create good synergy with existing mainland products offered by the Exchange. &amp;ldquo;Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing is committed to actively promoting the internationalization of RMB and continuously enhancing Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s position as a leading offshore Renminbi center,&amp;rdquo; said Head of Equities and Market Supervision, Calmer Yao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s existing listing, trading, clearing and settlement arrangements will generally apply to RMB counter securities under the dual-counter model. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange will announce the implementation date and a list of eligible dual-counter securities for inclusion in the designated participant mechanism in due course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-identify-hong-kong-dollar-rmb-exchange-counters&#34;&gt;How to identify Hong Kong dollar-RMB exchange counters
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Hong Kong Exchange documents, the dual currency (Hong Kong dollar-Renminbi) trading arrangement will largely follow the existing stock code allocation plan: stocks on the Hong Kong dollar counter will begin with &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; followed by a five-digit number, while those on the Renminbi counter will begin with &amp;ldquo;8.&amp;rdquo; The last four digits of the stock codes for both counters will be identical. Stock short names on the Renminbi counter will have &amp;ldquo;-R&amp;rdquo; appended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding trading arrangements, securities with the same category and convertible between Renminbi and Hong Kong dollar counters can be designated for short selling. If one counter (e.g., Hong Kong dollar) is designated, the other (e.g., Renminbi) may also be included according to exchange rules, and both will appear on the exchange&amp;rsquo;s list of securities approved for short sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks listed on both counters belong to the same category and are interchangeable. Buying with Hong Kong dollars and selling in Renminbi, or vice versa, will be considered &amp;ldquo;round-trip trading.&amp;rdquo; Settlement time between the two counters is T+2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short selling of specified stocks, such as borrowing Hong Kong dollars to sell them on the RMB counter, and vice versa, will be considered secured short selling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that under the dual-currency counter model, physical stock deposits and withdrawals are not available at the RMB counters as they are solely for trading and settlement. Physical stocks must first be deposited at the HKD counters before being converted to the RMB counters. Similarly, physical stocks can only be withdrawn after conversion from the RMB counters to the HKD counters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transaction settlement and delivery fees, including all Hong Kong clearing fees, are calculated and charged in Hong Kong dollars, except for dividend collection fees and interest collection fees, which are calculated based on the currency of the relevant securities&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Compiler, callback function, performance testing</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/compiler-callback-function-performance-testing/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 13:59:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/compiler-callback-function-performance-testing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, we designed a module responsible for handling event encapsulation and providing a class interface. During service initialization, the caller implements the corresponding class and passes the object pointer to the module.
Using function object callbacks offers greater flexibility compared to defining interfaces with pure virtual functions
The question arose: which grammar is faster in terms of performance? Without understanding compiler principles, let&amp;rsquo;s just try some code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An online URL that allows you to select different compilers, compilation parameters, and run code on a specified platform, or view the corresponding assembly code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, doing technical validations with small code snippets on webpages is very convenient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using different colors to distinguish code associated with different assemblies makes debugging easier than using a local debugger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standards committee defines the grammar rules; how to implement them at the compilation level depends on each compiler. Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s compilers are quite impressive. Syntax sugar isn&amp;rsquo;t all-powerful, and with fewer callback interfaces, using &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; is more convenient and eliminates the need for empty callback function interfaces. When there are many types of callback interfaces, traditional virtual functions are better suited for unifying business interface definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The platforms have similar performance with little difference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison, increased by 1.35 ns per cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In typical business system development, this level of performance loss is negligible. Signals and slots, logging, monitoring, business logic 1, and business logic 2 are completely decoupled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are two new modes: ordinary functions and emulated functions. There&amp;rsquo;s a significant performance difference—on the order of magnitude—between using interface callbacks and direct calls. Emulated function performance is close to that of regular functions, sometimes even better. This area (compiler principles) is a knowledge gap for me; my guess is that it’s due to variables and functions being located adjacent in memory, which benefits &lt;strong&gt;INLINE&lt;/strong&gt; processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attached is the execution result&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Host order, network order, observe directly through the debugger</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/host-order-network-order-debugger-observation/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 14:18:12 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/host-order-network-order-debugger-observation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the history of computer development, there has been no unified standard for data storage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two common rules for byte ordering. For example, little-endian refers to arranging the lower digits of a multi-digit number at smaller addresses and the higher digits at larger addresses; conversely, big-endian is when this arrangement is reversed. Byte order is a factor that must be considered in network applications because different machine types may use different standards, so they are all converted according to the network standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big-endian byte order aligns better with the left-to-right reading habit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-just-paste-the-text-here&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are! Just paste the text here.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processors such as x86, MOS Technology 6502, Z80, VAX, and PDP-11 are little-endian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processors such as Motorola 6800, Motorola 68000, and PowerPC 970 use big-endian order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The byte order for ARM, PowerPC (excluding PowerPC 970), DEC Alpha, SPARC V9, MIPS, PA-RISC, and IA64 is configurable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;network-preface&#34;&gt;Network Preface
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network transmission generally uses big-endian order, also known as network byte order or network order. Big-endian is defined as the network byte order in the IP protocol.
Socket definitions specify a set of conversion functions for transforming 16- and 32-bit integers between network byte order and host byte order&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;arpa/inet.h&amp;gt;

uint32_t htonl(uint32_t hostlong); //把uint32_t类型从主机序转换到网络序
uint16_t htons(uint16_t hostshort); //把uint16_t类型从主机序转换到网络序
uint32_t ntohl(uint32_t netlong); //把uint32_t类型从网络序转换到主机序
uint16_t ntohs(uint16_t netshort); //把uint16_t类型从网络序转换到主机序
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;strong&gt;INLIN_ITALIC_1&lt;/strong&gt;__ is chosen as the network library, the built-in namespace contains cross-platform adapted function names&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::host_to_network_long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::host_to_network_short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;visual-studio-debugger&#34;&gt;Visual Studio debugger
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In debug mode, select the Debug menu, then Window, and check Memory Window&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;INLIN_ITALIC_1&lt;/strong&gt;__, you can view data in memory directly within the debugger, as shown in the figure below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prints the variable name and jumps to its address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the variable is already a pointer, select it by double-clicking, drag it to the memory window, and display the contents at that address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the variable is not a pointer, add it to the calculation window, obtain its address, then manually copy it to the memory window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;bool NetworkMessage::decode_header()
{
    // 网络序转成主机序
    body_length_ = boost::asio::detail::socket_ops::network_to_host_long(*(int *)buffer_.data());
    return auto_reserve(body_length_);

        <title>At that time, he was young; perhaps he had talent, but not much</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/then-boy-talent-not-much/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 13:45:09 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my seventh year of working, the positive feedback from coding isn&amp;rsquo;t as frequent anymore. Looking back on how I ended up down this path.
The choices we make, especially in childhood, tend to follow positive feedback – proactively avoiding harm and seeking benefit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;one-childhood&#34;&gt;One, Childhood
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving downtown, encountering computer books? Hacker resources? Becoming familiar with Windows systems? Those are later stories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother&amp;rsquo;s uncle runs a shop in the computer market
We started using computers early on, so we developed a basic understanding of them. Later, in school and during computer classes, I remained quite interested.
I heard about the computer competitions in junior high, thought they were really cool, but then after transferring schools, I put that idea aside
During my first year of junior high, I was familiar with basic computer operations and often stood out in computer class
If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with it – yes, you read that right, not proficient, but familiar – with Microsoft Office suite, that would be even better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;moving&#34;&gt;Moving
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the move, once I got into the city, I ended up frequenting the library due to my neighbors. While I read a lot of novels, I also looked at many magazines.
Computer News, Popular Software
Increasingly interested in computers, with childhood admiration for hackers and actively learning related knowledge at school
Understanding the basics of operating systems: Control Panel, CMD commands, VBS scripts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This magazine is quite suitable for beginners; it explains operations systematically using case studies
software reviews, industry news, and more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;high-school&#34;&gt;High school
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my second year of high school, [this competition], the school leaders also paid it considerable attention
There&amp;rsquo;s also a foundational hardware aspect – an alumnus donated a building to the university, including a new library and computer lab. It’s all so coincidental.
With Bo&amp;rsquo;s explanations, he would be considered a computer expert in the class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic whiz + computer expert, knows how to hack computers and disable classroom surveillance software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition, despite its challenges, reached the finals. While I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully grasp everything, the questions focused on basic algorithms, but I did gain some valuable insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s still just half a bucket, like taking a trip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-college&#34;&gt;Four. College
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came time to choose a major in college, I followed my family&amp;rsquo;s suggestion and chose automation. I actually wanted to study high-voltage electricity, hoping to work for the power company after graduation, but I didn’t learn much of the coursework.
Self-directed learning is scarce in professional courses, but computer science courses within those programs come naturally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipping required courses, studying computer science diligently, and spending time daily on forums like &amp;ldquo;Jingyi Forum&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;52PoP.&amp;rdquo;
Combining knowledge of assembly language and C++,
Ultimately, Xiao Zheng&amp;rsquo;s choice was to write code for chips, and my family didn&amp;rsquo;t interfere; they let me choose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, [name redacted], with a high level of education, joined Baidu
My older sister understands me; she knows I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a state to think or research, so she told me to talk it over with my cousin
Finalize the future development path; skip going home for summer vacation, stay with the mentor, work on projects, and gain experience
Entered Hengan Electronic based on a still-acceptable academic record&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;graduation&#34;&gt;Graduation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the key – I took courses in information retrieval, knowing how to quickly find and locate materials and issues
A helpful mentor appeared at work, gave me time to learn independently, troubleshoot issues thoroughly, and introduced me to experts at the R&amp;amp;D center
This laid the groundwork, and now Shenzhen branch believes I&amp;rsquo;m impressive – I successfully took charge of the trading channel team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here lies a problem; my foundational knowledge of computer operating systems, algorithms, and software engineering design…
Without systematic study, it&amp;rsquo;s all based on personal experience
Frequently redesigning code, lacking a consistent approach to module design – after seven years, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to feel burnt out&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Chinas COVID-19 lifting of restrictions</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/china-coronavirus-unlocking/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 19:22:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/china-coronavirus-unlocking/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The policy was announced suddenly and implemented swiftly; travel codes are now defunct, and green health codes are no longer checked at public venues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browsing the New York Times Chinese website, the entire page is discussing China&amp;rsquo;s reopening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record the surroundings, without evaluating policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing never actually had zero-COVID policies. With restrictions lifted, the virus spread rapidly, resulting in widespread infections, but none of my friends have experienced severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shenzhen, neighboring Guangzhou, is also developing rapidly; while living in Shanghai, due to my company&amp;rsquo;s location near the suburbs, there hasn’t been widespread infection yet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insufficient protective measures, followed by widespread spread&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt roughly the same, with sudden shifts – a new policy every week until full reopening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s undeniable that the three-year zero-COVID policy had an effect; adapting to whatever comes&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>C11: sleep for vs yield</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/c11-sleep-for-vs-yield/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 20:54:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/c11-sleep-for-vs-yield/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It was the first time I saw this, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed it before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without checking the manual, my first thought was whether it&amp;rsquo;s related to asynchronicity. The term __INLINE_CODE_0__appears in the Boost library&amp;rsquo;s coroutine implementation, but it certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t related to coroutines here; the control logic is likely related to ordinary threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;document&#34;&gt;Document
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;yield&#34;&gt;yield
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accuracy of this function depends on the implementation, particularly the OS scheduler mechanism and system state. For example, a first-in, first-out real-time scheduler (such as Linux&amp;rsquo;s SCHED_FIFO) will suspend the current thread and place it at the tail of the queue of threads with the same priority (and yield has no effect if there are no other threads at that priority).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sleep_for&#34;&gt;sleep_for
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocks the current thread&amp;rsquo;s execution for at least the specified sleep_duration
This function may block for longer than sleep_duration due to scheduling or resource contention
The standard library recommends measuring duration using a stable clock. If implemented with system time, wait times may also be sensitive to clock adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analysis&#34;&gt;Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both functions release the current thread, and their effects depend on the platform. Still a bit unclear here; let&amp;rsquo;s run the code to see the execution results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThinkPad laptop (Visual Studio Community 2022), Tencent Cloud S2 standard server (gcc8.5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Runtime Platform&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Function&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;First/μs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Second/μs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Third/μs&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Windows&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;sleep_for&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9872&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1884&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11302&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Windows&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yield&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;119&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Linux&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;sleep_for&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;171&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;168&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;167&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Linux&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yield&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;101&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;102&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;101&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the operating system implementation, &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0__稳定性差异巨大，如果想要高精度的休眠，使用__INLINE_CODE_1&lt;/strong&gt; is more suitable for high-precision sleep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference is not significant when time accuracy is improved to &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c++&#34;&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;chrono&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;thread&amp;gt;
 
// 建议其他线程运行一小段时间的“忙睡眠”
void little_sleep(std::chrono::microseconds us)
{
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    auto end = start + us;
    do {
        std::this_thread::yield();
    } while (std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now() &amp;lt; end);
}
 
int main()
{
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
 
    little_sleep(std::chrono::microseconds(100));
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(100));

              &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot; microseconds\n&amp;quot;;

        <title>Resetting MySQL password on a Linux server</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/linux-server-reset-mysql-password/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 14:27:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/linux-server-reset-mysql-password/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have an idle Tencent Cloud server that&amp;rsquo;s expiring at year-end, and I didn’t plan to renew it. I deployed a MySQL database for development purposes. When reinstalling the system, I chose a third-party image from Tencent Cloud for convenience—it already had MySQL installed. I assumed there would be a Readme file or something similar explaining the password and deployment path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It quickly reinstalled the system on Tencent Cloud, notifying me it was ready in about a minute. Logging in, the service had already started. I searched for the password but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it and slowly began to feel defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having gained access to the server with those privileges, there must be a way to reset the password. I checked the documentation and found a post on the Alibaba Cloud forum; time to keep troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reset-password&#34;&gt;Reset password
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit configuration file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuse the existing user password, while enabling remote login&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;USE mysql;
UPDATE user SET authentication_string = password (&#39;pass&#39;) WHERE User = &#39;root&#39;;
grant all privileges on *.* to &#39;root&#39;@&#39;%&#39; identified by &#39;pass&#39; with grant option;
flush privileges;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reverted the configuration file, restarted the database, all done&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the vast system of Chinese characters, the character for &amp;ldquo;fate&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;life,&amp;rdquo; 命, stands alone – it has no homonyms. Perhaps this subtly suggests that each person&amp;rsquo;s life is unique and unrepeatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flipping through the rankings on Qidian Chinese, &amp;ldquo;Night&amp;rsquo;s Naming Technique&amp;rdquo; is dominating with its monthly votes, far ahead of second place by a huge margin – practically unattainable. I’ve mostly read works from established authors like Tang Jia San Shao and Er Gen in the past, but this time I decided to try a new author and experience a different kind of reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of early August, &amp;ldquo;Night&amp;rsquo;s Naming&amp;rdquo; had reached two million monthly tickets, significantly surpassing the second-place novel with only eighty thousand, a remarkable difference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lack the expertise to evaluate the writing of this book. However, having read through more than ten chapters, the plot is tightly paced and intricately connected, captivating the reader. The high number of votes it received is well-deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, like the character for &amp;ldquo;destiny&amp;rdquo; (命), the character for &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; (死) also has no homophones in Chinese. Does this perhaps suggest that the end of life is equally unique and irreplaceable?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A Brief Discussion on Automated Testing</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/shallow-discussion-on-automation-testing/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Testing investment for financial trading systems far exceeds that of other systems, with repetitive and cumbersome testing steps yielding too little value. As projects and personnel change, uncontrollable factors are inevitably introduced; a common scenario involves modifying a field in interface A, which unexpectedly impacts the results of interface B. With each version release, risks accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;theoretical-knowledge&#34;&gt;Theoretical knowledge
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ROI of an automated test case = (Manual Execution Time) * (Number of Runs) / (Development Cost + Maintenance Cost)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on automating tests for frequently used, stable features – this yields the greatest return&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not suitable now, as it&amp;rsquo;s like fetching water from afar to quench a thirst. Automation is a long-term benefit model. The project is already live and entering a stable release cycle; this is the best time for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;framework-selection&#34;&gt;Framework Selection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being assigned an automation testing task without relevant practical experience often leads to this: opening a search engine, looking for tools and frameworks compatible with the current system, reviewing user manuals, and starting off on what seems like a good note. If you can quickly find a suitable tool, congratulations, you&amp;rsquo;re lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize; it&amp;rsquo;s not that the resources don&amp;rsquo;t exist, but rather that the framework itself is too complex and consumes excessive resources. What beginners need is something small and streamlined. Consulting with colleagues on the testing team suggested building a custom framework—essentially, encapsulating existing unit testing frameworks into an automated testing framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refer to the design concept of this project: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/wintests/pytestDemo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/wintests/pytestDemo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-we-need-frameworks&#34;&gt;Why do we need frameworks?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service has multiple deployment environments – development, testing, and pre-production – with the framework&amp;rsquo;s role being to provide a layer of abstraction, separating test cases and data. It supports environment-specific configurations for case data while also allowing shared data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying logic is to improve automation utilization. For more complex scenarios where data varies across different environments and has no inherent relationship, simply add a &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; tag when configuring the case data to specify the supported environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Why learn other programming languages after more than ten years of experience with [this/it]?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of experience in elegant module design, grammar is flexible, and learning other languages can guide the creation of more elegant designs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often find myself using these tools when writing code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the underlying library design or the business module implementation, the design principles are consistent&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is so&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding encoding, __INLINE_CODE_0__BOLD_3&lt;code&gt;/source-charset&lt;/code&gt;BOLD_4&lt;code&gt;/execution-charset&lt;/code&gt; addresses the file&amp;rsquo;s original encoding and the encoding of bytes within the character array after compilation. These two options generally resolve encoding issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Chinese characters are displayed normally on the console&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Without understanding politics or offering commentary, documenting this &amp;ldquo;carnival&amp;rdquo; on the internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;random-thoughts&#34;&gt;Random thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent &lt;strong&gt;唐山打人事件&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;人教小学教材文化入侵事件&lt;/strong&gt;, I wonder how many still remember. These hot topics in the news have become numbing; there&amp;rsquo;s little feeling, just watching shows as usual after work, a mere spectacle. The economic situation is already like this—an outbreak of war won’t make things better. No political commentary, just recording this &amp;ldquo;celebration&amp;rdquo; online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-just-paste-the-text-here&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are! Just paste the text here.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, often referred to as Pelosi&amp;rsquo;s trip to Taiwan, was part of a larger tour of Asian countries undertaken by the then-Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese side strongly protested, dispatching naval destroyer formations to the northeast waters of the Taiwan Strait and mobilizing two carrier strike groups – Shandong and Liaoning – while the Eastern Theater Command and Southern Theater Command conducted large-scale live-fire exercises in the East China Sea and South China Sea respectively. The U.S. responded by deploying the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group to the waters near Taiwan to protect a potential visit by Pelosi, and has also deployed multiple reconnaissance aircraft and aerial refueling tankers to Marine Corps Air Station Kadena in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden held a video conference prior to the visit, discussing the Taiwan issue. Reports indicate that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a congressional delegation are expected to arrive at Taipei Songshan Airport on August 2nd, spend the night, and meet with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and other high-ranking government officials on August 3rd. Some observers believe Pelosi’s visit could trigger a new Taiwan Strait crisis, the first since the 1996 missile crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;08-11&#34;&gt;08-11
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s essentially settled now. Headlines have been dominated by naval exercises, and Zhihu has been working hard to update its trending topics daily—all about this subject. The editor appreciates the effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Quickly calculate folder size on Windows platform</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/windows-platform-quick-folder-size-statistics/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;What to do? With many disks and files, the system&amp;rsquo;s built-in File Explorer is too slow when trying to calculate folder sizes, making you want to give up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;everything&#34;&gt;Everything
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should also have heard of it from friends. Its search speed far surpasses the system&amp;rsquo;s built-in File Explorer. Since the system supports fast file indexing, there must be similar tools available that can establish a file index and simultaneously calculate file sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wiztree&#34;&gt;WizTree
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Website: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.diskanalyzer.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.diskanalyzer.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extract and run the standard installation or green version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast speed, diverse data display types – a tree diagram on the left, file types on the right, and graphical visualizations in the software&amp;rsquo;s bottom bar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spacesniffer-no-longer-maintained-as-of-update-2023&#34;&gt;SpaceSniffer (no longer maintained as of update 2023)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software website: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation is simple: select the corresponding disk, and the software will graphically display folder sizes. Larger volumes correspond to larger matrices in the image. Other operations are self-explanatory with a few clicks. It supports filtering files by input conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File size filtering&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>How to Copy Webpage Style Sheets (CSS): Element Inspection</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Static blog themes predominantly rely on foreign templates with minor modifications, without much consideration for typesetting Chinese content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About two weeks ago, I made some adjustments to my blog&amp;rsquo;s stylesheet. Having worked in backend service development for many years, I’m a complete novice when it comes to frontend. After fiddling with it all day, the design still wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite right. Then I had an idea – inspired by technical blogs like InfoQ and Open Source China, whose layouts are excellent. Could I borrow some of their techniques? I looked at the source code for a while, trying to locate the relevant elements, but ended up completely confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontend developers seeing this might be laughing&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t understand how to locate specific elements. No worries, I have plenty of time on the weekend; thinking back, I seem to have used something similar when writing crawlers before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;elemental-review&#34;&gt;Elemental Review
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it&amp;rsquo;s the browser&amp;rsquo;s built-in element inspection tool—copying style sheets and locating specific elements are quick tasks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy element&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai National Security database incident has been buzzing around the hacker circles, though it&amp;rsquo;s unclear if it’s true or not. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we remember it in a couple of years and revisit then. Based on past experience, after updating local social engineering (SOC) databases, I saw a massive SQL file: 17.9GB. Even previewing it is problematic with standard text editors, let alone opening it. Chatting online with some users, someone mentioned EmEditor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body

    &gt;https://www.emeditor.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried it out during my weekend free time – it&amp;rsquo;s quite convenient. The design supports editing large files, and with sufficient memory, the entire file loads into memory, making searching and editing fast. It also supports splitting files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Shanghai Hot Pot Lockdown</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-closure/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 23:03:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-closure/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The leadership insisted Shanghai wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be locked down, citing its importance. But facing the current situation—or to protect their own reputations—they took a piecemeal approach: first sealing off the area across from Huangpu River, then sealing this side as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lockdown&#34;&gt;Lockdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have vague memories of SARS from childhood; it ended relatively quickly due to its short incubation period, before a nationwide outbreak occurred. I remember being in elementary school then, dismissed early each day, and the classroom always smelled of disinfectant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the end of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing for nearly three years. People working outside their hometowns have become accustomed to wearing masks when necessary. This wave of the outbreak in Shanghai initially originated from Hong Kong, spreading through cross-border checkpoints to Shenzhen. The situation in Shanghai was also caused by imported cases from Hong Kong. Authorities later announced that the spread was due to inadequate protective measures at quarantine hotels, allowing a variant with weakened toxicity but faster transmission—spread via the hotel&amp;rsquo;s ventilation system—to proliferate. Initially, it wasn’t severe and could have been contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are always confident. The leaders in Shanghai are the same. They chose a risk control system we can implement with grid-based management and precise monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are clear – the new cases have exceeded 20,000. Faced with this situation, a lockdown was implemented, but it&amp;rsquo;s being referred to using different terminology to avoid using the word &amp;ldquo;lockdown,&amp;rdquo; as that contradicts earlier statements claiming Shanghai did not need one, preserving face for the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grocery-shopping&#34;&gt;Grocery shopping
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food delivery industry is a new sector spurred by the internet. Its core requirement is someone to deliver your order, but due to widespread lockdowns, businesses could operate, yet lacked delivery personnel – essentially missing a crucial link in the process. Outsiders might find it puzzling that people in a global city like Shanghai would rush to buy groceries en masse. However, it&amp;rsquo;s quite understandable; most residents are migrant workers living in rented apartments and typically rely on company canteens or restaurants instead of cooking at home. When these options were unavailable, those who could afford it started buying groceries. Because the lockdown announcement was unexpected, people lacked substantial food and vegetable reserves. This led to the rush seen in videos, which in turn caused gatherings that directly contributed to renewed spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;industry&#34;&gt;Industry
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone I know works in the IT industry. The pandemic gave me a taste of working from home – back in 2019, I was stuck at home for almost a month, rescheduling train tickets countless times, unable to determine when I could return to Shenzhen. It&amp;rsquo;s unimaginable what people in the food, tourism, and service industries have been through these past few years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ordinary people are social creatures, that&amp;rsquo;s right – you are a person, and also an upright-walking animal with strong social attributes; possessing feelings of inferiority and vanity. Society is constantly changing and eroding your essence. We won’t discuss the great individuals who willingly sacrifice themselves for society or for their country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;right-now&#34;&gt;Right now
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering average wages, or even those in my hometown, my current income is already significantly above average. What more could I possibly want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you earn ten thousand, you&amp;rsquo;ll think of earning a million; once you earn a million, you&amp;rsquo;ll think of earning ten million. This is human nature, and one must confront their own inner desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s causing all the envy? It’s the easy money of short videos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone understands that entering this industry isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. What you see is this short video, but you don’t see the scriptwriting and filming behind it. Yet, everyone dreams of being a genius, believing they are naturally suited for that field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching so many videos, a little analysis reveals clear professional editing and a strong cinematic feel. This suggests they have formal training. While there&amp;rsquo;s logic to grassroots success stories, it doesn’t apply to most people, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Douyin, you&amp;rsquo;ll find countless videos teaching you how to make videos. That’s when reality sinks in: if this could really make money, why wouldn’t they do it themselves instead of teaching others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anti-human-recommendation-algorithms&#34;&gt;Anti-human recommendation algorithms
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, Douyin&amp;rsquo;s algorithm would recommend movie clips and anime edits, which were enjoyable to watch. But when I started looking into how to make money on Douyin, it began relentlessly recommending instructional videos, flooding my feed. As someone in the IT industry myself, I couldn’t help but wonder if the team behind the algorithm had lost their minds. Is this recommendation strategy meant to imply that users are foolish? And the fact that they keep suggesting ways to earn money through Douyin, from various angles and types… This piece is being written at 3 AM, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t even intend to write it. I just question how long this business model can last and how much time it will consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understand-life&#34;&gt;Understand life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preaching one thing when instructing others, but failing to control oneself – that&amp;rsquo;s a joke. Not a pure technical blog writer, so I haven’t published much domestically. Here, I’m just casually complaining. If this gets shut down someday, I guess I’ll find another place. I can’t say Douyin hasn’t done anything; at least currently, it actively assists with the spread of real-time news and the promotion of state policies. After all, in China, you can&amp;rsquo;t go against the Party, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back to my school days now. When you truly can&amp;rsquo;t find the meaning of life, quietly reading a book is enough. In today’s era, how many people can still sit down and read quietly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also want to thank the advancements in science and technology. If you can see this line, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice the entire draft is very conversational. Honestly, I just read it aloud and wrote it down. I used Sogou Input Method for years, but when it comes to voice input, iFlytek is undoubtedly more professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article number for 2022 was changed to 002. Why are there two extra zeros? It&amp;rsquo;s a dream that the number of entries this year could exceed one hundred – it really is a dream. They aren’t exactly articles, more like records. I examine myself three times a day; you surely can think of something, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Add a code copy button for what seems like a simple thing</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/add-code-copy-button/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 01:23:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/add-code-copy-button/</guid>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working on it for four hours, seeing that sentence made me laugh—how could it possibly take so long? Then I checked the time: three hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first draft of 2022. It&amp;rsquo;s not a complicated project, just as the title states (I was quite young then). I thought simply saving &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ouuan.github.io/post/from-hexo-to-hugo/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;作业&lt;/a&gt; would be enough, so I put it in my favorites and waited over a month before remembering this task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving to &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;, I always felt there were too few plugins. The inability to copy code snippets made migrating notes from Notion a hassle, as copying code became cumbersome and significantly dampened my motivation to update my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prologue&#34;&gt;Prologue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s carefully review the original author&amp;rsquo;s manuscript, read it through and check their introduction. Wow, I’ve stumbled upon a big shot – a current undergraduate student at Tsinghua who started with computers early on. Hmm, just browsing this blog now; completely forgot what I was supposed to do. By the way, let&amp;rsquo;s also check out the author&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;__INLINE_CODE_0__BOLD_2&lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; theme – it’s much better than the current one and has more features. Let&amp;rsquo;s get it running; first merge the relevant code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.ttf248.life/p/add-code-copy-button/2022-02-25-02-08-19.png&#34;
	width=&#34;215&#34;
	height=&#34;150&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;1&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;143&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;344px&#34;
	
&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.ttf248.life/p/add-code-copy-button/2022-02-25-02-08-40.png&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;311px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-feature-view-article-history-related-submission-records&#34;&gt;New feature: View article history, related submission records
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect is pretty good; you can experience it by reading to the end of the article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really look at the author&amp;rsquo;s repository history before starting, assuming a simple merge would fix it. Ended up merging a lot of code, with conflicts and numerous iterations. I just overwrote everything blindly, prioritizing my own code for frontend and rendering templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warehouse address: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TianlongXiang/hugo-theme-even&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/TianlongXiang/hugo-theme-even&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pitfall in Chinese, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;italicized text&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, leads to the failure of historical link generation; generating a complete article history also requires modifying the auto-integration script. Remember to pull all historical records from the current repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are! Just paste the text here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are! Just paste the text here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;name: Build Github
run: git config --global core.quotePath false &amp;amp;&amp;amp; hugo -b &amp;quot;https://www.xiangtianlong.com/&amp;quot; -d &amp;quot;github_public&amp;quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ls
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;style-adjustments&#34;&gt;Style adjustments
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjusted the site content width. The previous design was suitable for both mobile and desktop, but in reality, no one views it on their phone; I mostly use it on my computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The directory bar supports auto-sizing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent over half an hour looking at the code record for &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;, but still couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to add the copy button&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time passes, and after a month, I thought of it again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don&amp;rsquo;t understand this assignment, I might as well copy another one; eventually, I’ll figure it out. The search results were surprisingly __INLINE_CODE_0__官方的论坛里面就有个帖子提到了如何增加复制按钮，跑过去一看，逻辑清晰。懵逼的事情来了，回到的站点一看__INLINE_CODE_1__revealing a difference in the code block styling and the description in the materials—this part is quite tedious, so I&amp;rsquo;m just noting it briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I barely understand front-end development, I kept the browser open &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;，对着代码分析、靠着右边的样式器信息，慢慢也分析懂了逻辑；__INLINE_CODE_1__and couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand it, so I checked the console for logs. There were many things I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand, but I calmed down and slowly sorted out and broke down the logic; eventually, I could find a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple nodes exist; here, this refers to a single code block. The theme generated line numbers, resulting in two copy buttons appearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want code highlighting, but I&amp;rsquo;m not familiar with how to set it up in this theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settings to control code highlighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjusting the configuration file, it&amp;rsquo;s consistently wrong; the rendering doesn&amp;rsquo;t match expectations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding these settings, I&amp;rsquo;ll continue reviewing materials and adjusting them—let’s remove line numbers first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure custom &lt;code&gt;css&lt;/code&gt;BOLD_2&lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt;scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten things to this point, it suddenly occurred to me that I saw a nice color scheme recently – let’s update the button styles with a Chinese-style celadon blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;special-img-class&#34; style=&#34;width:20%&#34; src=&#34;2022-02-25-02-01-22.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took four hours, and when I saw that sentence, I thought it was funny – how could it take so long? Then I looked at the time: three hours&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is it that we spend our whole lives pursuing?</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/we-exhaust-ourselves-chasing/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 21:09:58 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/we-exhaust-ourselves-chasing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person&amp;rsquo;s interactions with their spouse can last a lifetime—sometimes arising from shared ideals and understanding within the home, sometimes stemming from entrusting one’s fate and wandering beyond societal constraints&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person&amp;rsquo;s life is like a fleeting moment; like grass and trees, flourishing in spring and withering in autumn; like the rising and setting of the sun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, I have so many desires in this life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lying by the stream as a child, peeling lotus pods, while eagerly releasing kites in the east wind, chasing after yellow butterflies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He leaned against mulberry trees to learn about melons, returned with a full meal after dusk, and slept under the bright moon without taking off his raincoat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I hope to achieve great success, have a beautiful partner, enjoy abundant wealth, rise through the ranks, host lavish gatherings, and celebrate every night with music and revelry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging, yet desiring health and longevity – welcome servants, await children, a game of chess, a close friend, a pot of wine, a courtyard, and the enjoyment of family life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People rush about, chasing after a few coins. Yet those very coins can ease all sorts of worldly sorrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are struggling just to make ends meet; who has time to pursue meaning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, life is merely an experience—like grass, trees, the sun, and moon—a cycle of desires&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not understanding life leads to the feeling that we are like mayflies adrift in the universe, a grain of sand in the vast ocean. We lament our fleeting existence and envy the endless flow of the Yangtze River. Understanding life brings joy in what is encountered, satisfaction with what one gains, contentment without seeking more, unaware of approaching old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pursue wealth and fame, or poetry, wine, and tea; you can chase the clear breeze on the river, or the bright moon in the mountains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be overly concerned with the outcome; results are fleeting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To exhaust a lifetime, arriving in this world to experience as much joy and sorrow, birth and death as possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this line from Big Fish &amp;amp; Begonia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lives are short, and we will inevitably lose them, so let&amp;rsquo;s be bold – love someone, climb a mountain, chase a dream. There are many things in life with no answers, so let’s be bold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like &amp;ldquo;The Pavilion of Prince Shaobo&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Ode to the Red Cliffs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The causes of grief over the passing of others are like a binding agreement; I have never faced literature without lamenting, unable to contain it within my heart. Indeed, knowing that life and death are illusory and that equating ages is futile. Those who come after will view us as we now view those gone before. Alas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rare, but eventually you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter it given enough time. Associated stock code: Berkshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When submitting stock codes with names containing certain formatting, adjustments to the code name are required for Interactive Brokers (IB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRK/B -&amp;gt; BRK B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Interactive Brokers, it can be analyzed to determine that the conversion rules are fixed and can be implemented through coding. When the rules are not fixed, the system generally needs to store corresponding mappings, which business operation personnel update periodically.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/lost-and-confused/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Often, at some point in life, people fall into a state of confusion, unsure of what they truly want. Amidst the mundane routines of work, they gradually lose sight of their pursuit of meaning. Remembering when I first graduated, my heart was filled with fervent aspirations; back then, I would have confidently said that I longed to write code—remarkable, exceptional code. However, in my current role, I’ve primarily dealt with operational matters, largely benefiting from the dividends of industry growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding my outlook on life, I haven&amp;rsquo;t considered marriage, having children, or establishing a career. My mind is mostly blank, and I just want to enjoy the present moment. On weekends, I like to play games quietly and often spend the whole day at home, immersed in my own world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs something they love and wholeheartedly dedicate themselves to in life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buy-house&#34;&gt;Buy house
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I was determined to save enough money to buy my own home and meticulously planned every expense. However, seeing house prices continually rise, I went from anxiety and resentment to numbness. Eventually, I realized that even if I bought a property, it would just be another heavy burden, so I gave up on the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;save-money&#34;&gt;Save money
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, saving money was about achieving small goals – like building a powerful desktop computer, buying a camera I&amp;rsquo;d long wanted, or taking an impromptu trip. Now, I approach saving with a more relaxed attitude, worry less about daily expenses, indulge in what I want to eat, and boldly try new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;go-home&#34;&gt;Go home
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I realized that what I truly longed for was simply to go home. No special occasion needed, just returning to a familiar place and feeling the warmth and tranquility of home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Hong Kong stock futures basics</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-futures-basics/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 10:54:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-futures-basics/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As financial markets evolve, investors are seeking more effective investment tools to enhance returns. To meet this demand, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has launched a series of stock futures contracts representing stocks listed on its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hong Kong Joint Stock Exchange Limited (Joint Stock). These contracts offer high liquidity and active trading, allowing investors to participate in the performance of individual companies while benefiting from features like short selling and leverage available in derivative markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors can choose to invest in stock futures representing specific industries if they believe that industry&amp;rsquo;s performance will outperform or underperform the overall stock market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-definition&#34;&gt;Basic Definition
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stock futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a financial instrument equivalent to a specified quantity of stock at a predetermined price on a future date&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contract-expires&#34;&gt;Contract expires
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The profit or loss amount, calculated as the difference between the initial agreement price and the final settlement price, multiplied by the contract multiplier, will be deducted from the account of the contract holder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final settlement price is the official closing price reported on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on the last trading day for the relevant stock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If stock futures investors wish to close their positions before expiration, short sellers only need to buy back a futures contract, while long position holders sell a futures contract&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;security-deposit&#34;&gt;Security deposit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When trading futures, both buyers and sellers must first pay an initial margin as a guarantee of fulfilling the contract. The clearing house calculates daily profits and losses on all open contracts at the closing market price, which serves as the basis for debiting or crediting investor accounts. If adverse market conditions result in losses that reduce the margin below the required level, the exchange will require investors to replenish their funds within a specified timeframe to maintain the initial margin level (i.e., topping up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advantages&#34;&gt;Advantages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low transaction fees: Each stock futures contract represents the value of thousands of shares, and commissions for buying or selling contracts depend on the number of contracts traded, resulting in very low costs relative to the contract&amp;rsquo;s value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short selling stocks is now easier: Investors can profit in a downturn by short selling stock futures, as this process is readily available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market makers are required by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to simultaneously provide bid and ask prices within a specified range to ensure market liquidity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage allows investors to buy or sell stock futures contracts by paying only a small portion of the contract&amp;rsquo;s face value, making hedging and trading more cost-effective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing foreign exchange risk for overseas investors: Stock futures contracts provide a way for foreign investors to invest in high-quality local stocks, as trading them requires margin rather than the full contract value, significantly reducing their exposure to foreign exchange risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading is conducted through an electronic trading system: stock futures contracts are bought and sold using the exchange&amp;rsquo;s electronic system. Orders are executed based on price and time priority, with real-time display of bid prices, ask prices, and transaction prices, achieving the highest level of market transparency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The clearing house provides performance guarantees: stock futures contracts will be registered, cleared, and guaranteed by Hong Kong Futures Clearing Company Limited (the Clearing House), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the exchange. As the Clearing House acts as counterparty to all open positions, participants are relieved from counterparty risk. However, this guarantee does not cover clearing members&amp;rsquo; financial obligations to their clients; investors should carefully select their brokers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dealer-system&#34;&gt;Dealer system
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market participants may register as market makers for individual stock futures, providing both bid and ask prices within a specified maximum spread. Exchange participants and their clients should note that individual stock futures may not have market maker registrations offering bid-ask spreads, and trading will be based on market order units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;risks-of-trading-stocks-and-futures&#34;&gt;Risks of trading stocks and futures
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading stock futures involves high risk. Losses can exceed the initial margin deposit, potentially requiring you to pay additional funds in a short period. Failure to do so may result in forced liquidation of your positions, with all losses borne by you. Therefore, it is essential that you understand the risks of trading stock futures and assess whether they are suitable for you. Before trading, consult a broker or financial advisor based on your financial situation and investment goals to determine if trading futures and options contracts is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes to a company&amp;rsquo;s equity structure through share offerings or bonus shares can affect the stock price at net asset value or effective date, potentially impacting open positions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all other factors remain the same, the value of a shareholder&amp;rsquo;s holdings will not change on the net asset value date. However, this is different for buyers or holders of stock futures unless appropriate adjustments are made to the futures contract. Without adjusting the settlement price and if the multiplier of the stock futures contract remains unchanged, an adjustment in the underlying stock price would create unreasonable and unfair effects on the value of the stock futures position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clearing house adjusts rates to maintain fair value for futures contracts, making changes only when significant alterations occur. The Hong Kong Exchange will announce the details of these adjustments, and exchange participants must inform their clients about them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Decline of Capital Monopoly and the Online Education Industry</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:59:08 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The stock market has fallen sharply over the past two trading days, giving new investors a taste of market risk. Our country is about to enter an aging phase, and birth rate data is grim—the decline significantly exceeded expert estimates. Industries hindering birth rates will be cracked down on by the Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-student-workload&#34;&gt;Reducing student workload
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We, born in the 90s, didn&amp;rsquo;t have so many extracurricular classes or tutoring sessions. After school, we’d just run wild and play – partly due to family circumstances and partly because tutoring hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet established a brand reputation to convince parents. Twenty years have passed. Starting in 2019, K12 education began its capitalization trend, with companies like Yuanfudao emerging as leading online tutoring platforms. Fueled by capital, they concentrated resources to create various prestigious tutoring programs, and even exorbitant fees couldn&amp;rsquo;t contain parental enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst urbanization, many parents have escaped poverty and achieved upward mobility through education. As working professionals with limited time, they are highly driven themselves and want their children to keep up with their peers. With few alternative paths for families without strong educational backgrounds to maintain or advance their social standing, pursuing vocational high school is often seen as a step down – something most parents cannot accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do extracurricular tutoring exist, and why do parents need it? Textbook knowledge and example problems are easily understood, but many subjects cover a broad range of topics, albeit superficially. Talent selection requires differentiation, creating a contradiction: textbook-based questions alone cannot effectively filter candidates and require horizontal and vertical expansion. These areas are impossible for teachers to fully cover in class, and this gap fosters the growth of extracurricular tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document contains extensive content, with thirty detailed provisions regulating various aspects. Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the guiding document outline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce overall homework volume and duration, easing students&amp;rsquo; excessive workload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve school after-school services to meet diverse student needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strictly regulate after-school tutoring activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significantly improve education and teaching quality, ensuring students learn well while at school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen supporting measures and enhance capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully organized and implemented, aiming for practical results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;elite-education&#34;&gt;Elite education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the education sector, a growing trend is the increasing number of private schools, while public schools are struggling to provide sufficient quality resources (leading to the rise of desirable school districts). Various educational groups attract talented teachers with high salaries and establish excellent learning environments, gradually building their brands. A well-known example is &lt;strong&gt;衡水模式&lt;/strong&gt;. The average annual cost at a reputable private elementary school can range from nine thousand to ten thousand dollars. These education groups create a positive cycle: higher tuition fees are justified by skilled teachers, good student results, and continued parental enrollment. Consequently, talented public school teachers are drawn to the private sector, ultimately leading to a decline in the quality of public education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;algorithm-exploitation&#34;&gt;Algorithm exploitation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data indicates that Meituan has nearly four million signed riders, with 400,000 to 500,000 active. Many depend on this work to support their families. Relentless algorithmic pressure squeezes delivery time, reducing people to measurable units and feeding them into calculations, constantly pushing riders to the point of collapse. It seems clever, but it is. The market is here; let&amp;rsquo;s play a good game—a sustainable one—rather than a destructive one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility&#34;&gt;Stock market volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 2021, education stocks, led by New Oriental, performed a dazzling dive, followed shortly thereafter by U.S.-listed companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our country is gradually entering an aging population phase. Various social phenomena affecting family planning will be addressed; internet companies with monopolistic practices and excessive overtime have been fined, and the education industry where capital has concentrated has also been regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education should not be capitalized; any attempt at listing for financing is immediately rejected, leading to widespread outcry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;li&gt;New Oriental&amp;rsquo;s Severed Waist&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A method for disrupting systems, used for system stability testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s internet industry always likes to create something new; sometimes you hear a term and have no idea what it refers to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the definition of Chaos Engineering&amp;rsquo;s early stages most relatable after reviewing some articles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early explorations of chaos engineering have existed within the industry, previously appearing as fault testing and disaster recovery drills. With the continuous development of microservice architectures and the increasing scale of distributed systems, chaos engineering has begun to emerge and gain increasing attention. Following Netflix&amp;rsquo;s formal introduction of the concept, related theories rapidly expanded. Their practices have demonstrated the significant value of chaos engineering in ensuring stability.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/kubernetes-pause-pod/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Deployment controllers implement a crucial function in Kubernetes clusters: horizontal pod scaling (expansion and contraction). This capability is essential for modern cloud platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When encountering a business scenario requiring database modifications and Pod restarts, we need to temporarily pause the application&amp;rsquo;s updates to the table while data is being adjusted, then resume the Pod after the adjustments are complete&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there other ways to achieve a similar effect to pausing, besides forcefully deleting Deployments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;kubectl scale --replicas=0 deployment/&amp;lt;your-deployment&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before seeing the answer, many people probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have thought of it. Once they see it, a smile comes to mind – their thinking hasn’t caught up, still stuck in an era focused on directly manipulating processes and wanting to operate business processes that way.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fund and fixed income wealth management</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/fund-and-fixed-income-wealth-management/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 11:27:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/fund-and-fixed-income-wealth-management/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of us born in the 90s, we didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel the impact of the 2008 financial crisis because we were young and not yet focused on investing. The bull market of 2015 was dramatic, with a significant correction before government intervention stabilized it. This brought the concept of investment funds into the view of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ant-financial-and-alipay&#34;&gt;Ant Financial and Alipay
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alipay, as a natural traffic entry point under Ant Group, was initially positioned as a payment tool. Most people chose Alipay for buying funds compared to WeChat. Alipay successfully transformed fund sales into ordinary shopping. The bull market starting in 2019 and the mutual support among fund managers were ultimately driven by pandemic-induced monetary easing. Those who entered (the market) profited, while those who watched became envious and rushed to enter. The speed at which new funds surpass 10 billion yuan is accelerating. With even older generations now buying funds, trillion-dollar funds are within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the rise of Ant Group&amp;rsquo;s internet-based fund sales platform, ordinary people typically encountered fund sales only when depositing money at banks, where branch managers would enthusiastically promote various financial products. The packaging and promotional information on the internet, along with the exorbitant advertising fees paid by fund sales institutions, have made Alipay’s fund advertisements completely detached from reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provided growth data only shows the returns for the past three years on the table, and only the annualized average return for legacy funds. Why don&amp;rsquo;t they publish the annual average return separately? Is it difficult to calculate? No, it’s because the data is unfavorable and doesn&amp;rsquo;t easily encourage customers to buy the fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fixed-income-investments&#34;&gt;Fixed income investments
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has not yet entered the era of negative interest rates. Bank deposits and government bonds are the most reliable fixed-income products; pure bond funds are also a good option. You can easily find China&amp;rsquo;s average salary by checking data released by local statistical bureaus. Here’s a simple scenario: with 2 million yuan in assets, an annualized return of 4% would generate annual income exceeding the average salary in most cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s largely based on my personal experiences, and there’s a lot I could write. If you want to learn more, I recommend reading books on economics; don&amp;rsquo;t blindly follow trends. For ordinary families, the core of financial management is preservation of value, not chasing get-rich-quick schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle often says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing the right thing at the right time yields the greatest value. Studying diligently and obtaining a good education is better than earning pocket money distributing flyers. Working hard after graduation brings substantial returns in salary increases. When starting a family, learn to care for your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those interested can check out this speech: Regarding time, you need to read many books to find the answer; the full text is available on this site&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Trading Interrupted</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A trade disruption refers to when a trade has been executed and IB has received execution information from the exchange. Then, the exchange realizes that an error has occurred (such as pricing, electronic processing issues, obvious errors, etc.) and decides to disrupt (cancel) the trade. This process is entirely determined and controlled by the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A busted traderefers to a situation where an execution occurs and IB receives the execution messagefrom the exchange. The exchange then realizes some type of error (Pricing,electronic, obvious error, etc) and rules to bust (cancel) the trade. Theexchange makes these rulings entirely on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a trading perspective, it is equivalent to trade cancellation and trade correction on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Recently, while handling ChinaConnect business, I reviewed materials from the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;After working for many years, I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered numerous users, and some content is not applicable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installation can refer to the manual from Tsinghua University: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/docker-ce/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install&#34;&gt;Install
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to an unknown mysterious force, it is recommended to use cloud vendor-provided repository addresses for Docker installations within China; here, we recommend &lt;strong&gt;阿里云&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;set-repository-source-address&#34;&gt;Set repository source address
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;yum install yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo http://mirrors.aliyun.com/docker-ce/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deploy-the-latest-version&#34;&gt;Deploy the latest version
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Docker, as a commonly used background service, is recommended to be set up for startup on boot. This command applies to CentOS 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;sudo yum install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io &amp;amp;&amp;amp; systemctl enable --now docker

        <title>Setting up a JMeter Testing Environment on Linux</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/linux-setup-jmeter-testing-environment/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 10:12:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/linux-setup-jmeter-testing-environment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The author, with a strong interest in hardware, conducted performance testing using JMeter and documented the deployment process of JMeter, InfluxDB, and Grafana on CentOS 7. They shared details on JMeter installation and command usage, InfluxDB features and Docker installation, as well as simple Grafana deployment and configuration. The document summarizes experiences and references for high-performance programming patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What use is a web panel in addition to data display?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t understand until you try it yourself
Don&amp;rsquo;t use GUI mode for load testing! only for Test creation and Test debuggin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official recommendation is to obtain the load test report via command line and display it with a GUI, which may introduce data errors? I don&amp;rsquo;t have a deep understanding of JMeter, but at least this gives me a reason to experiment with the console panel in version &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deployment method of Open Source China&amp;rsquo;s posts is not user-friendly, and the required files for installation also need to be downloaded via a public account. As a new generation, I naturally chose an alternative. Ultimately, it’s still slow accessing cross-border sources due to servers being located domestically; at least mirror services offer acceleration, like the free one from Alibaba Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installation deployment of &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; is not detailed here; please refer to previous articles for guidance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following content is divided into two parts: building basic testing environment components and a brief introduction to each component&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jmeter&#34;&gt;Jmeter
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apache JMeter is a load testing tool developed by the Apache organization, based on Java. It was initially designed for web application testing but has since been extended to other testing areas. It can be used to test static and dynamic resources such as static files, Java microservices, CGI scripts, Java objects, databases, FTP servers, etc. JMeter can simulate a large load on servers, networks, or objects to test their strength and analyze overall performance under different stress categories. Additionally, JMeter can perform functional/regression testing by creating scripts with assertions to verify that your program returns the expected results. For maximum flexibility, JMeter allows the use of regular expressions for creating assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache JMeter can be used to test the performance of static and dynamic resources (files, Servlets, Perl scripts, Java objects, databases and queries, FTP servers, etc.). It can simulate heavy loads on servers, networks, or objects to test their resilience or analyze overall performance under different types of stress. You can use it for graphical analysis of performance or to load test your servers/scripts/objects with high concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-deployment-on-centos-7&#34;&gt;JMeter deployment on CentOS 7
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installation package&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
wget https://mirrors.bfsu.edu.cn/apache//jmeter/binaries/apache-jmeter-5.4.tgz &amp;amp;&amp;amp; tar -xf apache-jmeter-5.4.tgz
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configure environment variables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;export JMETER_HOME=$HOME/jmeter/apache-jmeter-5.4
export PATH=$JMETER_HOME/bin:$PATH
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-commands&#34;&gt;JMeter commands
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, observe data on the control panel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;jmeter -n -t /tmp/order-500-10s.jmx -l /tmp/jmeter-order-report-20200109/order-500-10s.jtl
# 一般不用测试结果和测试报告，简化命令
jmeter -n -t /tmp/order-500-10s.jmx
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;influxdb&#34;&gt;InfluxDB
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;InfluxDB is an open-source distributed time series, event, and metrics database written in Go, requiring no external dependencies. It&amp;rsquo;s now primarily used to store large volumes of timestamped data, such as DevOps monitoring data, app metrics, IoT sensor data, and real-time analytics data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;influxdb-features&#34;&gt;InfluxDB Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The features of InfluxDB can be summarized into 9 aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unstructured (no pattern): Can have an arbitrary number of columns;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The retention period for metrics can be configured&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports time-related functions (e.g., min, max, sum, count, mean, median) for statistical analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports storage policies: Can be used for data deletion and modification (InfluxDB does not provide methods for deleting or modifying data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous queries are a set of statements that automatically start on a schedule in the database, and when paired with storage policies, can reduce InfluxDB system resource usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Native HTTP support, built-in HTTP API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports SQL-like syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows configuring the number of data replicas within the cluster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports periodic sampling data, writing it to another measurement for granular storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;installing-influxdb-docker&#34;&gt;Installing InfluxDB Docker
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;mkdir influxdb &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd influxdb &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \
docker run -p 8086:8086 -d --name influxdb -v $PWD:/var/lib/influxdb influxdb:1.7
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter container, execute command, manually create database&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;root@bce0a55bbc72:/# influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.7.10
InfluxDB shell version: 1.7.10
&amp;gt; 交互面板执行命令
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;creating-databases-and-users-in-influxdb&#34;&gt;Creating databases and users in InfluxDB
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create database jmeter_t2
View databases
Switch database: use jmeter_t2
Create user &amp;ldquo;admin&amp;rdquo; with password &amp;lsquo;admin&amp;rsquo; and all privileges
View Users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; show users
user  admin
----  -----
admin true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If user permissions are displayed, database preparation is complete&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grafana&#34;&gt;Grafana
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for chart display is not essential; the &lt;strong&gt;INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/strong&gt; data from the interface can already be observed when executed in the command line, and it&amp;rsquo;s more about understanding the program&amp;rsquo;s internal execution time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple deployment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The console supports filtering test results by tag, and typically only requires configuring one database&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application Name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Case Name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.ttf248.life/p/linux-setup-jmeter-testing-environment/Snipaste_2021-03-09_19-44-22.png&#34;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web version calculations are affected by sampler interval&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document also describes how to customize __INLINE_CODE_0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-performance programming inherently relies on a single loop thread; any locks, queuing (for entry and exit), will cause unnecessary performance loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time spent on core business logic exceeds the time spent on introducing other code; concurrency is effective only when this core processing time is sufficiently small, and otherwise, introducing additional code should be approached cautiously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Red Hat and CentOS are popular choices for online production environment operating systems. Links to the official lifecycle information for both systems are provided, along with experience upgrading from CentOS 8 to CentOS 8 Stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In online production environments, Red Hat and CentOS are currently the mainstream choices in China. Following the retirement of Red Hat 6 in recent years, here are links to the official life cycle websites for both systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are! Just paste the text here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS are popular choices for enterprise server operating systems. RHEL offers stable support and update cycles, suitable for enterprise applications. CentOS, as a community version of RHEL, provides similar functionality and stability but lacks official support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chase-for-more&#34;&gt;Chase for more
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When publishing this article, I never thought I would update it again after two years. Just the other day, I upgraded my daily-use virtual machine from CentOS 8 to CentOS 8 Stream. I won&amp;rsquo;t elaborate on production choices, but I still prefer the latest versions for local environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CentOS 8 Stream is a rolling release offering faster updates and new features compared to traditional CentOS, making it suitable for development and testing environments&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a tangent: the differences between socialism with Chinese characteristics and capitalism. Older generations often say, &amp;ldquo;To get rich, first build roads.&amp;rdquo; Infrastructure construction in China is funded by the state; in a capitalist society, these projects would be contracted out. In remote areas where there’s no profit to be made, companies wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be willing to take on such work. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to stray too far from the article&amp;rsquo;s main topic, but ordinary people may not feel much impact from the trade war. However, China&amp;rsquo;s high-end manufacturing has consistently been relatively weak. In my IT industry, memory, hard drives, CPUs, and graphics cards – the core components of a computer – all come from foreign factories. These parts account for 50% of the total cost of a machine. The development of high-end manufacturing is essential. A collision between China and the United States is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sino-American trade war (also known as the China–United States trade war, or Sino-American trade dispute/friction/dispute) was a trade war between the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China and the United States&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade dispute originated when U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on March 22, 2018, claiming &amp;ldquo;China steals American intellectual property and business secrets&amp;rdquo; and directing the United States Trade Representative to impose tariffs on goods imported from China under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, involving an estimated total value of $60 billion. On July 6, 2018, the U.S. imposed a 25% tariff on Chinese goods exported to the U.S., valued at $340 billion. The Ministry of Commerce of China responded with retaliatory measures, imposing a 25% tariff on U.S. goods exported to China, valued at $340 billion, including soybeans, a major U.S. export.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China previously reached a consensus in May 2018 to suspend the trade war, issuing a joint statement seeking resolution. However, the USTR subsequently announced the first batch of tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese goods on June 16, raising the original 10% rate to 25%. In response, China’s State Council Tariff Commission implemented retaliatory measures, and the Ministry of Commerce restarted anti-dumping investigations on multiple US products. On July 6, the Trump administration formally imposed a 25% tariff on $340 billion worth of Chinese goods (with an additional $160 billion subject to tariffs on August 23), marking the formal implementation of Trump’s China tariffs. The Ministry of Commerce stated that the US had violated WTO rules and launched the largest trade war in economic history. Customs authorities confirmed that China&amp;rsquo;s retaliatory measures were implemented after the US tariffs took effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 1st at the G20 Buenos Aires summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump reached a consensus to initiate 90-day negotiations and suspend new trade measures during that period. After the March 1, 2019 deadline expired, the U.S. announced significant progress and extended the suspension of new trade measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs of 25% on Chinese goods entering the United States valued at approximately $200 billion, bringing the total subject to tariffs to $250 billion. The measure took effect on June 1 for goods arriving at U.S. ports. On May 13, China’s State Council Tariff Commission announced that it would raise tariffs by 5% to 25% on certain imports from the United States valued at $60 billion, effective June 1. On June 1, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative delayed the imposition of its 25% tariffs until June 15, while China’s State Council Tariff Commission stated that its tariff measures would take effect as scheduled on June 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 29, leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump met at the G20 Osaka Summit, agreeing to restart trade negotiations and for the US not to impose new tariffs on Chinese products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 1st, due to the Trump administration&amp;rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the progress of China’s purchases of U.S. agricultural products, Trump announced via Twitter that a 10% tariff would be imposed on all remaining Chinese goods imported into the United States starting September 1, 2019, amounting to $300 billion. On August 5th, the yuan-dollar exchange rate fell below 7. The same day, the U.S. Treasury Department declared China a currency manipulator. Subsequently, the Chinese government announced a suspension of purchases of U.S. agricultural products and on August 24th announced tariffs of 10% or 5% on approximately $75 billion worth of U.S. goods, as well as restoring tariffs on U.S. automobiles and their parts; the United States responded by increasing the tariff rate on the previously levied $300 billion in Chinese goods to 15%, and raising the existing 25% tariff on $250 billion in Chinese goods to 30%, but this was later suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 16, 2020, China and the United States signed the Phase One trade agreement&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Building computers</title>

        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/computer-assembly-tips/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The author developed an early interest in assembling computers and began exploring hardware during university. They recommend a website for comparing hardware performance and offer purchasing advice on components like CPUs, SSDs, HDDs, and memory frequency. The text also shares hardware selection experience and important considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fate-beyond-words&#34;&gt;Fate, beyond words
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was little, I wanted to build my own computer, but the financial situation wouldn&amp;rsquo;t allow it. Finally making it to university, I opted for a laptop for portability. If you want a specific time, it all started at my hometown library. It’s a district-level library with not only an electronic reading room (which I never actually used – they charged by the hour) but also a magazine reading room. That&amp;rsquo;s where I stumbled upon magazines like &amp;ldquo;大众软件&amp;rdquo; (Popular Software) and &amp;ldquo;电脑报&amp;rdquo; (Computer News). For someone with limited exposure to computers, these were essentially divine resources. Seeing chapters about raiding dungeons made me want to build my own computer so I could pull mobs and be a main damage dealer; seeing the “black technology” sparked fantasies of replicating what was described in the books (a discussion on using hacking tools). Though high school coursework was demanding, with my limited knowledge at the time, I felt I needed to both study and play. I spent a carefree youth often strolling to the library under the guise of reading, carrying a small bag. The city wasn&amp;rsquo;t large, so I usually walked. Once there, I’d enjoy the air conditioning while browsing novels, comics, and gaming magazines, occasionally looking at more serious books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you get older, forgetfulness becomes more common; this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time something like this has happened at the library. When I was in middle school, my relatives assembled a computer – I don’t remember why they built it. It ran Windows 2003 and had Solitaire and Age of Empires. We spent countless hours trying to sneak away with the key to play games with my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering junior high, the school offered introductory computer training. Later, when I transferred schools, I was briefly exposed to the idea of computer competitions. By high school, I participated in NOIP once. Speaking of which, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible not to mention the power of alumni – the high school’s computer building, including classrooms and a library, was funded by alumni donations. It was also during the initial wave of China’s internet boom. School leaders supported participation in computer competitions, as several senior students from the previous two years had been admitted to top universities through computer-related pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never looked back at my relationship with computers like this before. No wonder I switched from automation to the computer industry after graduating – the seeds were already sown, though those involved didn’t realize it. Having been exposed to them since childhood, I thought I knew a lot, but in reality, I only grasped the basics. My biggest advantage was that initial passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hardware-assembly&#34;&gt;Hardware assembly
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browse the forums on Cardekho, Chiphell, and Zhihu&amp;rsquo;s computer assembly sections; beginners can easily create a list of components they need. If your budget is limited and you want higher performance when buying a CPU after 2019, AMD is generally the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a translation of the provided Chinese text: &amp;ldquo;I recommend a useful website for comparing hardware performance: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/&lt;/a&gt;. You can generally compare prices with those on Xianyu (闲鱼, eBay China) there. Serious enthusiasts can find great deals on used items on Xianyu, saving a lot of money. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re not very knowledgeable, I don’t recommend it; I bought fake memory there myself. Although it seems to be working fine now, I’m not entirely sure, as the model and specifications are completely mismatched.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;sn550-vs-sn750&#34;&gt;SN550 VS SN750
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between the SN550 1TB and SN750 1TB is that their sustained read/write speeds are about half – one at 850MB, the other at 1.6GB. However, there&amp;rsquo;s no noticeable difference in everyday use because both have the same 4K performance. This refers to the 1TB capacity SN550; the 500GB and 250GB versions are slower. Unless you’re not concerned about cost, the SN550 is perfectly fine for daily use. My main reason for not buying it wasn&amp;rsquo;t its sequential read/write speed, but rather that it only comes in a maximum of 1TB capacity, while the SN750 offers 2TB. For me, the value of having an extra M.2 NVMe slot on my motherboard is greater than the price difference between these SSDs, without needing to expand further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With consensus from online users, purchasing an adapter allows a B150 motherboard to support an M.2 SSD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;choosing-a-mechanical-hard-drive&#34;&gt;Choosing a Mechanical Hard Drive
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, mechanical hard drives are priced stably. For users with high storage needs, selecting a suitable mechanical hard drive is necessary. Frequent downloaders are recommended to choose enterprise-grade hard drives, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Western Digital Gold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seagate Exos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;memory-frequency&#34;&gt;Memory frequency
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a daily work perspective, frequency won&amp;rsquo;t significantly impact performance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!&lt;strong&gt;Link 0&lt;/strong&gt; Link 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory timings (or RAM timings) are four parameters—CL, TRCD, TRP, and TRAS—measured in clock cycles that describe the performance of synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM). They are typically written as four numbers separated by hyphens, such as 7-8-8-24. The fourth parameter (RAS) is often omitted, and a fifth parameter, Command rate (typically 2T or 1T, also written as 2N or 1N), may be included. These parameters specify latency values that affect random access memory speed. Lower numbers generally indicate faster performance. The ultimate determinant of system performance is the actual latency, usually expressed in nanoseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When converting memory timings to actual latency, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to remember they are measured in clock cycles. Without knowing the duration of a clock cycle, it’s impossible to determine if one set of numbers is faster than another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, DDR3-2000 memory has a clock frequency of 1000 MHz and a clock cycle of 1 ns. Based on this 1 ns clock, a CL=7 results in an absolute latency of 7 ns. Faster DDR3-2666 (clocked at 1333 MHz with a 0.75 ns cycle) may use a larger CL=9, but still achieves a shorter absolute latency of 6.75 ns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern DIMMs include a Serial Presence Detect (SPD) ROM chip containing memory timings recommended for automatic configuration. The PC BIOS may allow users to adjust these timings to improve performance (with the risk of reduced stability) or, in some cases, increase stability (such as using suggested timings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Memory bandwidth measures memory throughput and is typically limited by transfer rate rather than latency. Interleaving access to multiple internal banks of SDRAM allows for continuous transmission at peak rates. Bandwidth can be increased at the expense of increased latency. Specifically, each new generation of DDR memory features higher transfer rates, but absolute latency doesn&amp;rsquo;t change significantly – especially in the first batch of products on the market, which often have longer latencies than the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing memory bandwidth can improve the performance of multi-processor or multi-threaded computer systems, even with increased memory latency. Higher bandwidth will also enhance the performance of integrated graphics cards without dedicated video memory.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Website Acceleration and Domain Settings</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/website-acceleration-and-domain-setup/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 10:36:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/website-acceleration-and-domain-setup/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to slow access speeds within China for GitHub Pages, the author applied for a personal domain and purchased CDN acceleration services from a domestic cloud hosting provider. During configuration, they encountered an issue where the www subdomain was inaccessible, ultimately resolved by removing wildcard domain resolution and setting up the second-level domain separately. The author also shared the principles and configuration experience of CDN acceleration, as well as their attempts and lessons learned using Nginx reverse proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which can be slow to access from within China for certain well-known reasons. Therefore, I applied for a personal domain and purchased CDN acceleration services from a domestic cloud hosting provider. While setting up the acceleration service, I realized I had a development machine with Docker, frp, k8s, and other services deployed – all of which have dashboards. Following the principle of not letting resources go to waste, I configured several reverse proxies and linked them to subdomains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was happily using my second-level domain, I suddenly found that the www subdomain was inaccessible. The DNS configuration in Alibaba Cloud resolves both &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.xiangtianlong.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;www.xiangtianlong.com&lt;/a&gt; and xiangtianlong.com simultaneously. Before enabling CDN acceleration, both domains worked correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When configuring CDN acceleration, enabling a wildcard domain rule due to having too many subdomains resulted in the www subdomain also failing. Yes, you read that right – the www prefix is considered a subdomain. The actual website is deployed on GitHub Pages, and the development machine has no cached web content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using GitHub Actions for automated deployment is surprisingly convenient for a static blog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;domain&#34;&gt;domain
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-professional web development doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve understanding SEO or cross-domain issues. For a blog site, using a bare domain can highlight the blogger’s site—which is exactly my situation with using Chinese pinyin as a domain name—and also helps reduce character input, especially given the prevalence of mobile access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desktop version allows you to skip typing &amp;ldquo;www&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;com&amp;rdquo; using keyboard shortcuts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cdn&#34;&gt;CDN
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used both Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud; they are easy for new users to get started with. Tencent Cloud even has a video explaining the related concepts. The principle of CDN acceleration is the same as that of JD&amp;rsquo;s warehouse: when launching new products, they are pre-distributed to warehouses across the country, and delivery requests are fulfilled from the nearest location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return address: The original location where website resources were stored&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache file settings, browser F12, management console, simple analysis of static and dynamic resources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All 0-day validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0-day validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-day validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tencent Cloud Configuration Rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 10 cache expiration rules can be configured&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The priority of cache expiration rules is bottom-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache expiration time can be set up to 365 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-lamentable-confession&#34;&gt;A Lamentable Confession
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used Nginx before and thought I could understand reverse proxy configuration just by searching online. However, it was confusing; after a lot of effort, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even get a 302 redirect working, rendering the whole thing useless. So, I decided on a simple solution: removing the wildcard domain resolution and setting up each subdomain independently. That’s when I noticed Aliyun DNS had a &amp;ldquo;Display URL Jump&amp;rdquo; mode – exactly what I needed for a 302 redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting up the first subdomain and confirming it worked, I ran into issues with the second. I almost started doubting myself, but then it suddenly started working after a wait. It seems Aliyun&amp;rsquo;s DNS propagation occasionally glitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Blog IDE Environment and Random Thoughts</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/blog-ide-environment-and-ramblings/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 13:54:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/blog-ide-environment-and-ramblings/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This article introduces the basic concepts of Markdown and its applications in various software. It recommends using VSCode as an IDE and lists recommended plugins. The author shares their experience switching from Hexo to Hugo, emphasizing Hugo&amp;rsquo;s flexibility and customization capabilities. Finally, it provides tips for quickly getting started with new technologies and shares a trick for resolving Hugo theme styling update issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lightweight markup language that allows people to write documents in an easy-to-read and write plain text format&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed Markdown syntax is not elaborated on here; instead, an ebook is recommended: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://markdown-zh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;点击此处&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many software programs already support md as a writing format. The CSDN blog system launched an online editor that supports md syntax, and it includes a helpful introductory article on md syntax when you first use it. Evernote added md note support in 2018, with various md markup options readily available, making the experience similar to editing regular articles and suitable for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recommended-ides&#34;&gt;Recommended IDEs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time this article was written, it was 2020. You&amp;rsquo;ve likely heard of VS Code—after all, anyone considering using Git Page to build a blog system is an industry professional. While Sublime and Atom were good choices in earlier years, with two years of community support, VS Code has rapidly developed and become the preferred starting point for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s relationship with the open-source community has transitioned from a fractured state to a honeymoon period: embracing open source. The company I work for has also actively adopted the Java ecosystem in recent years; in other words, the current Java landscape is genuinely appealing within China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vs-code-plugin-recommendations&#34;&gt;VS Code plugin recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugins typically include Readme files detailing basic usage, core features, and sometimes dynamic effect demonstrations provided by the plugin authors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It easily integrates images, complementing Hugo&amp;rsquo;s image plugin approach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t remember the shortcuts, open the VS Code shortcut management menu, search for &amp;ldquo;md,&amp;rdquo; look at it several times; review the plugin instructions again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugo&#34;&gt;hugo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m naturally restless; I can’t just sit still and write articles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo supports placing images and Markdown documents in separate folders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Academic themes support various article styles in design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various convenient custom extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;academic&#34;&gt;academic
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website defaults to ______&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The URL structure allows single-page navigation, avoiding scrolling on the homepage—a matter of personal preference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formats: Essays, speeches, ebooks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility: Customize overall style, customize CSS styles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme&amp;rsquo;s support for Chinese is not yet fully mature, mainly from a visual perspective – the font size isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal for Chinese reading habits. However, it benefits from being developed by mostly Chinese developers, giving it an advantage over Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;rsquo;s best to do things yourself – inspect the browser elements. Once you’ve located an element, clicking on &lt;strong&gt;Insert Style Rule Below&lt;/strong&gt; in the sidebar allows you to easily retrieve the CSS style name, even for deeply nested styles.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;官方链接&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child is about to complain again – why are you being so vague from beginning to end, without mentioning any details?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to say that these things are enough for you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Official Manual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugin Description&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quickly get started with new technology, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to first read the official documentation. Don’t feel pressured to understand everything in one go; at least aim for a general understanding. Search engine results may not always align with the latest version and could be misleading. The same applies to new books – start by looking at the table of contents to grasp what the author intends to cover. Sometimes, reading the preface first is helpful; in some foreign works translated into Chinese, the translator&amp;rsquo;s preface often summarizes the book’s core content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-egg&#34;&gt;Easter egg
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching Hugo Academic&amp;rsquo;s built-in style and publishing to the site didn’t change the appearance. Clever users likely figured out that clearing the browser cache would solve the problem. And me, being ingenious: F12 developer mode, switched to &lt;code&gt;network&lt;/code&gt;BOLD_2&lt;code&gt;disable cache&lt;/code&gt;, refreshed, and it&amp;rsquo;s done!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Automatic System Switchover</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/auto-integration-system-switch/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 29 Mar 2020 02:11:33 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Automatically deploy a Hugo blog to GitHub Pages and Gitee using GitHub Actions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;background-introduction&#34;&gt;Background introduction
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While updating my blog yesterday, I noticed that the Travis service was unavailable. Checking the Travis website, I saw the progress was stuck on pulling source code. This reminded me of GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Actions service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given it will be quite busy and requires an application to use, now that it&amp;rsquo;s officially launched, and with a free weekend, why not try out a new toy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find official information on the website. I won&amp;rsquo;t be reposting it further. If you’ve used Kubernetes before, you’ll notice that the action YAML configuration is quite similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For beginner tutorials or introductory materials in Chinese, search for &lt;strong&gt;阮一峰的博客&lt;/strong&gt;. There are two articles: the first introduces basic grammar, and the second presents a practical case study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Required knowledge points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;github secrets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action grammar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core job is completed using existing components, pushed to the domestic Gitee with commands. The command portion is rather crude, utilizing force pushes and inheriting logic from Travis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reviewing Hugo&amp;rsquo;s issues, I found that for automatically deploying Git Pages using GitHub Actions, the final published webpage needs to be on the master branch. If deployed to another branch, GitHub will indicate a syntax issue with the deployment page in the settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is that Hugo&amp;rsquo;s source files were located in the master branch, causing GitHub to treat them as Jelly blog code and fail checks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is simple: Hugo source files are placed on another branch, and static files are published on the master branch&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Chinas good future will be one with kind elders</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hope that in twenty years, I&amp;rsquo;ll be a lovely old man, accompanied by a lovely old woman. Not seeking great wealth or status, just good health and the ability to travel around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;script&#34;&gt;Script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to work hard to become a lovable old man. The China of the future will be one with good old men and women. Even if I’m 60 years old in 10 years, I’ll still be among the youngest in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, people find it quite impressive that a 50-year-old Chinese man can have this physique. But behind this body is the principle I believe in: the more disciplined you are, the freer you become! After the rain stopped, I wanted to go running, and I&amp;rsquo;ll play soccer tomorrow afternoon. At 50, I can still compete at a high level – I’m not kidding, often playing with professionals. But what&amp;rsquo;s behind it? Discipline. I spend my remaining days running, and some find it monotonous. The more disciplined you are, the freer you become. Because of my discipline, I am free to run, never listening to music; I believe listening to my own breath is the most beautiful music for running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely use the treadmill. Despite Beijing&amp;rsquo;s severe smog, I run five days a week—two already reserved for the smog. Unlike others, I never skip a day. Each month, I mark a running day in my journal, always at least 18 days. Runs fly by; I don’t wear glasses while running. More importantly, I also play soccer weekly. My last class with my graduate students will be at my home, focusing on the theme of fun—I believe fun is crucial. I never interact with people lacking joy and hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To treat them with respect and keep a distance – such people are truly frightening. If you don&amp;rsquo;t find joy, what joy do you have? I really don’t have much either. What kind of work do you like? This year at the beginning of the year, one of my graduate students was assigned to China News Weekly. We had a special topic. Every year when my graduate students graduated, their last assignment was to write an article about 10 years from now, which I would keep. Then, 10 years later, I would unfold them one by one. I also wrote about turning 50 and writing to 60 – something I never thought would be so distant, beyond the map, but suddenly it&amp;rsquo;s my next stop. Writing from 20 to 30 for my students is like a love letter from spring to summer. But writing from 50 to 60 is just a murmur from late summer to autumn. Now, I’m writing to 10 years from now – slowly writing about myself, about a bed, a meal, and the people around my family. That&amp;rsquo;s perfectly normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what kind of person should one be at 60? My goal is clear. As stated in the preface, this article is lengthy. I want to strive to become a lovable old man in 10 years. China&amp;rsquo;s lovability depends not only on having more young people who will become responsible citizens – no longer just ordinary folks, but energetic and rule-abiding youth – but also on having good old men and women. Currently, over 230 million Chinese are already over 60; in 10 years, that number will certainly exceed 300 million. In terms of the population aged 60 and above alone, China would be a top 5 country globally, possibly even third – just imagine how daunting that is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. I don’t know if everyone has seen the table online showing the average life expectancy in various Chinese provinces and municipalities; Shanghai and Beijing both exceed 80 years old, counting both men and women. The average lifespan certainly favors men over women. That means even when I’m 60 in ten years, I&amp;rsquo;ll be among the youngest in this third stage of life. Women retire at 55 to an average age of 80, leaving them with 25 years; men retire at 60 to an average age of 80, leaving them with 20 years! You can’t just do square dancing all the time. And I can say that today&amp;rsquo;s older sisters and brothers doing square dancing have been given this cultural habit and entertainment by the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another 20 years, there will likely still be square dancing, but on a much smaller scale. Younger generations are not as enthusiastic about group activities; just as older people prefer organized tours, young people increasingly opt for independent and self-guided travel. Square dancing will continue to exist, but its scope will diminish—this isn&amp;rsquo;t inherently good or bad, it’s simply the times changing. When I was 60, the youngest member of a team, I should be asking myself: what kind of person should I become? Chinese painting says that at 60, your ears are attuned – but I certainly wouldn’t listen to everything happily; I&amp;rsquo;d still hear what shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be said, and even happiness can turn sour. More importantly, what can I do for the younger generation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do to contribute to good things? Don&amp;rsquo;t be lazy, don&amp;rsquo;t compromise easily, oppose what needs opposing. Can you stand in front of a young person when they might harm someone’s interests? I often find myself looking at this mirror now. A good friend of mine has passed away. Tao Wei used to gather with us frequently at our home and once told me a true story. We all felt the pain together. The older generation, like Chen Lao, hoarded everything in their homes – you break open a box and find over 30 items hidden under the bed. You tell them this shirt cost over 500 yuan, now it’s being worshipped with incense daily. Therefore, our generation grew accustomed to battling wits with our parents. What&amp;rsquo;s the value of something bought for 700 yuan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to run into trouble with these things. Once, Tao Wei spent over 400 yuan on a T-shirt for his father. It was a really nice shirt; how much did it cost? 99. I wore that style and the next day, disaster struck. When he came back in the evening, he demanded 400 yuan from Tao Wei to buy four more for me. After wearing mine out today, Uncle Li and others all praised it. They said this kind of behavior carries a significant risk. Don&amp;rsquo;t do such things when you’re older. I won&amp;rsquo;t mention specifics about who is in the hospital orthopedic ward – an elderly person fractured their bone, and the crucial reason was the shoes bought from a street vendor. Of course, this only addresses the material aspect. Even as we age, we need spiritual life, curiosity, and a willingness to shield younger generations from hardship. Live each day happily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m curious and excited about turning 60, feeling it will be a wonderful beginning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>My 18th birthday might be different from yours</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/my-18th-might-be-different/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a very common thing—since graduating high school and abandoning the time spent reading novels, it’s been a long while since I’ve seriously and quietly read a book. Sometimes looking back, after working for so long, do I even remember what I did each year? Often, by mid-year, I&amp;rsquo;ve already forgotten much of what happened in the first half. Blogging is a good habit; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if much of what I write isn’t public—it’s originally meant for myself anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most loyal reader is myself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video-footage&#34;&gt;Video footage
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Youku search; no further links will be provided&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;script&#34;&gt;Script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s 18th birthday is like a gaze of anticipation and questioning. Each person occasionally asks themselves: Are you the person you wanted to be back then? I fear that nowadays, everyone has countless online friends but no real connections, chats endlessly but lacks genuine conversations, gains endless knowledge but remains far from wisdom. Everyone should ask themself, using their 18th birthday as a reminder: deceiving others is easy; deceiving yourself is difficult!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone&amp;rsquo;s 18th birthday is like a gaze of anticipation and questioning. You can deceive others, but you can’t deceive your own 18-year-old self. Are you the way your 18-year-old self wanted to be? I think that&amp;rsquo;s alright. Today, there are so many more things than I thought about at 18 – material possessions, fame, etc., all obtained. But on the other hand, I’m still on the journey. When I was 18, I studied journalism at the broadcasting academy and wanted to become a great journalist like Farahachi. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m still on that path. That&amp;rsquo;s why people often ask me, &amp;ldquo;Bai Shi, why are you still at CCTV?&amp;rdquo; Because I want to be a good journalist. The news continues. It’s the gaze of my 18-year-old self. So I think everyone should occasionally ask their 18-year-old self: Are you living the way you wanted to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that truly can&amp;rsquo;t be faked. This is what I looked like when I was 18. Thirty-two years have passed in the blink of an eye. Everyone who came to Beijing to study would have a photo like this. Back then, we wore wrinkled suits on Tiananmen Square and proudly pinned our school badges to our chests because there were so few college students. My hair was long back then, but I still really liked how I looked at 18. After many years, I suddenly realized that I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for what I faced at 18, because it quietly shaped me. On May 8th, 1986, I bought a collection of Misty Poetry at the Wangfujing Bookstore. That year, I heard Cui Jian’s “Nothing to My Name” at the Workers’ Stadium. And today, I suddenly realized that my writing style—and even my personality—was most influenced by Misty Poetry, rock music, and Gu Long&amp;rsquo;s martial arts novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did you experience at 18? What baggage might you carry as a result? I&amp;rsquo;m particularly curious about what 18-year-olds are facing today – is it like being carved with knives and axes? But what tools are doing the shaping? What kind of person have they molded you into? I worry that now everyone has countless social media connections, but lacks true friends; they chat constantly, yet no one truly confides in anyone. Knowledge is limitless, yet wisdom feels distant. They know everything, yet understand nothing. It seems like everyone&amp;rsquo;s talking about individuality. But as an observer, I see that today’s young people are remarkably similar. What should you let him experience at 18? I really love 1986; it was the best way to resolve the issues of 1966.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cultural Revolution ended with the downfall of the Gang of Four in 1976, a result partly due to chance. True progress requires enlightenment and a resurgence of humanity, alongside individual growth. We still need this awakening, and a thorough understanding of human nature. Regardless of economic advancements, if we fail to genuinely understand and guide human nature – addressing its darker aspects while activating its inherent goodness – concerns will persist. My 18th year mirrors the era&amp;rsquo;s; having strayed too far, we must remember our initial purpose, now distilled into the four characters: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t abandon your original intention.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how far you go, everyone should ask themselves the question they asked at 18. It&amp;rsquo;s good to have a photo from that time and look at it often to check in with yourself. What others say is irrelevant; it’s easy to deceive them. Deceiving yourself is difficult. I said earlier when I was 18, I would tell someone who is now 20: always let your 18-year-old self be a pair of eyes watching you. And as for those in their twenties, as I mentioned before, try opening many doors – you don’t know which one suits you best. It&amp;rsquo;s surprising in China today to see people in their twenties acting like elders, and many young people who are 70+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>What kind of journalists does society need?</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/what-kind-of-journalists-does-society-need/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2020 11:08:38 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/what-kind-of-journalists-does-society-need/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The text discusses the author&amp;rsquo;s perspective on journalism, emphasizing the need for social conscience, knowledge, and perseverance. The author also shares reflections from their 50s, including maintaining curiosity, balancing material and spiritual needs, and contemplating the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video-footage&#34;&gt;Video footage
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Youku search; no further links will be provided&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;script&#34;&gt;Script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best journalists first possess a social conscience, then knowledge, and finally perseverance. It’s not enough to just run a short distance; it requires endurance. Combining these three qualities, people expect that potential safety concerns regarding vaccines will be completely resolved – like the milk powder incident, where progress is consistently made through cycles of problem emergence and resolution, ultimately leading to complete solutions. Otherwise, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of journalists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the best journalists first possess a sense of social responsibility, second, a foundation of knowledge, and third, perseverance – it’s not enough to just run 100 meters; you have to keep running. Combining these three qualities, I turned 50 this year, and you&amp;rsquo;ll understand that I seem well-suited for journalism. I am naturally closely linked to China’s 40 years of reform. When I turned 30, I stood on the bank of the Songhua River; when I turned 40, my birthday was spent entering and exiting the Olympic broadcasts in 2008. Turning 50 this year coincides with nationwide commemorations of the 40th anniversary of China’s reform and opening-up. So, if we consider a person&amp;rsquo;s 40th year and China’s 40 years of reform – are they a time of clarity or confusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 40 years, China has provided ample material wealth for both its people and the nation. Yet, anxiety and confusion have increased instead of diminished. We thought that strength and prosperity would solve everything, but we&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that material comfort is just a foundation – escaping poverty materially is easy, but achieving spiritual richness and becoming a true global power is incredibly difficult. The U.S. is already targeting our high-tech sector; we need to focus on agricultural products. There’s always a difficulty in being the “number two.” How many number twos has America replaced? Therefore, we inevitably face a long journey to transform this &amp;ldquo;second&amp;rdquo; status into something beyond ourselves – I can&amp;rsquo;t expect to have it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to start in television at 25, initially doing interviews. I came into contact with hundreds or even thousands of people surrounded by various auras. When young, we thought these auras must bring happiness, but upon getting closer, it turned out not to be the case; the aura and their happiness often had an inverse relationship. Just finished reading about Guo Moruo’s last 29 years—despite holding high positions like Vice Premier of the State Council and various leadership roles in political advisory bodies, both his sons died, one by suicide and another possibly thrown from a building. Could he have been happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you use to measure happiness? For a former vice premier, having two sons leave her within a few years in their sixties and seventies could bring her happiness. Many famous calligraphy works can bring happiness. Having safely lived through many years can bring happiness. What more is needed? So I think observing people&amp;rsquo;s reading habits is the best mirror. To put it slightly emphatically, I feel that many people’s anxiety now stems from thinking too much and reading too little. This is a reply from Mrs. Yang Jiang to a young person. People expect instant gratification without reading, hoping to find a quick fix with just a phone. How could that be possible? I learned to be clever through the clumsy process of reading books; subtraction comes from reading more and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect everyone to change, but I hope the proportion increases – that more and more Chinese people can find a better version of themselves through education. That’s what matters most. No one sits on the ground staring at the stars and figures everything out; I can’t do that. But I can look in the mirror. A few years ago, a BBC news anchor—they claimed he was their best—came to Beijing. Someone organized a dialogue between him and Chinese anchors at the International Hotel, and we had a conversation. During the discussion, he asked me what the BBC should learn from CCTV. I joked, “Of course, first you need to learn Chinese.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I joked that the BBC should learn from CCTV about its curiosity towards the world. We&amp;rsquo;ve rapidly expanded our presence globally in recent years, establishing over 70 foreign bureaus. Our reporters feel a great sense of curiosity when encountering new things abroad, observing the world with immense eagerness. The BBC, however, seems to have settled for Britain as their entire world—they’ve lost that curiosity. My friend slapped the table and said, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re absolutely right; that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we lack.&amp;rdquo; In 2007, a Japanese writer told me something similar during an interview: “This country has everything except hope.” I understood then how profound those words were. Looking at it from another angle, a decade ago, I felt China lacked almost everything except for hope—everyone believed there was potential ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I worry about a day when we too become a wealthy nation with everything but hope. To be honest, I fear that China will reach a point where it feels truly poor despite having everything. I dread becoming someone who has all their material needs met but is ultimately very impoverished at 50. We see many highly educated yet uncultured people and countless individuals with overflowing bank accounts who are still poor in spirit. This is the problem of our time. True poverty isn&amp;rsquo;t frightening; it holds potential and hope for the future. That’s why I believe there&amp;rsquo;s a moral deficit and a loss of humanity – scientists invent things not out of some grand mission, but from curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see what I can produce. So, starting around 50, I began pushing myself to be even more curious, which makes me happy. One frustrating thing now is persistence. You mentioned you’re still persistent, and I said, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t,&amp;rdquo; because once persistence becomes a matter of life or death, it&amp;rsquo;s close to the end. We used to say that perseverance equals victory. In Chinese football, we&amp;rsquo;d grit our teeth and persevere through those black three minutes – no fun, no method, just perseverance. Perseverance can be important sometimes, but often this statement has two sides. I worry that when I’m persevering in something, like finishing this conversation even though my time is up, I wonder what it will turn out like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give yourself a small focus, but engage in conversation with everyone. I believe that as long as you can maintain a strong sense of curiosity at 50, it’s fine. I like all fun things, though not necessarily the current trends—today&amp;rsquo;s fashions can disappear quickly. Do you remember any past buzzwords? Can today&amp;rsquo;s internet media possibly evolve into what traditional media once was? Fun always has an inherent appeal. I respect everyone&amp;rsquo;s preferences; there&amp;rsquo;s a reason behind them. But in the long run, people still prefer playing mahjong. When you enjoy fast food, the restaurants serving elaborate meals will naturally decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things can&amp;rsquo;t just be dismissed with a passing thought. How much fragmented reading do you do on your phone each day? How much longer-form content do you actually read? But this is also a process; the phone is becoming our shackle. I don’t worry about “content is king,” because seeing more and more short-form content will gradually lead to nearsightedness, but it&amp;rsquo;s a process nonetheless. People will indulge in entertainment until they reach 40, just like seeing teenagers drinking soda – you advise them to drink less, but you know they won’t listen. However, I remain optimistic; at 40, he will return to the world of tea. That is the essence of a Chinese life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s normal, but I hope the next change comes quicker. We’re just lamenting how few investigative journalists there are now; you don’t seem to be doing investigations anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>What will Chinese football be like in 20 years?</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-football-in-20-years/</link>

        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-football-in-20-years/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;These supplementary reflections were mostly written spontaneously in 2021, during the early days of the pandemic when Bai Yansong&amp;rsquo;s speech was transcribed. The world always changes beyond expectation—not just after twenty years, but even a year or two later. Now, domestic COVID-19 is nearing its end, while overseas outbreaks continue. Regarding football, the national team has been playing well in recent years, and the coach dares to play offensively. Compared to the clueless days of old, it&amp;rsquo;s somewhat enjoyable watching with my grandfather. What an experience it is – a national team match that makes even an elderly person want to change the channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video-footage&#34;&gt;Video footage
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use Youku search; no further links will be provided&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;script&#34;&gt;Script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you still curious about Chinese football? Very curious, what could it have fallen to? You find there are many reasons why Chinese football doesn&amp;rsquo;t play well, and one of them is that no one wants to risk losing the ball themselves – they don’t pass it to others; there’s just no such approach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is just one small reason. Twenty years of football—after 20 years, Chinese football feels so distant. The first expansion brought the number to 48. China might go, but it still might not. The optimal age for a national team is 26-30; that&amp;rsquo;s today’s 6-10 year olds. Twenty years will make you feel optimistic—certainly possible after 20 years. But when I mention today’s 6-10 year olds, your expression immediately turns serious. So, cause and effect are intertwined: what are we planting today? We almost planted soybeans to have the national team play in a league – what will grow from this? Whoever initiates this action needs to prepare for dismissal; it violates the rules. That’s why I haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we really should think about today&amp;rsquo;s 6-10 year olds – are they playing soccer? You’ll know what Chinese football will be like in 20 years&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Moral deficit, human natures loss</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;When doing things, the most important thing is to act with a clear conscience. This ensures peaceful sleep and helps you discern right from wrong. If mistakes are made, do your best to rectify them; don&amp;rsquo;t hide or try to forget. Humans are easily forgetful, yet also possess good memories. Inner peace is the ultimate destination – being able to answer yourself honestly leads to a more relaxed life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;script&#34;&gt;Script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have eight characters that carry significant weight: I feel we currently have a deficit of morality, a loss of humanity. History progresses through a cycle of problems arising and being solved, repeatedly solving them thoroughly. You need patience to wait for the reshuffling. For a country like China, many things are a slow process of reshuffling, so don&amp;rsquo;t be pessimistic during change and reshuffling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These past few days, China has been battling two typhoons – one invisible, the other visible. The invisible typhoon is the vaccine, which challenges our sense of security. The visible typhoon rarely lands in Shanghai and impacts Beijing and Tianjin; it&amp;rsquo;s unprecedented for three major cities to face such a storm together in decades. That’s aside from the point. What you need to consider now is whether you can thrive on your own. You’ve changed greatly, possessing many answers. But if the environment remains unchanged, will you be happy? I have eight words that carry significant weight: we currently have a deficit of morality and a loss of humanity – this is the greatest deficit and the biggest loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People expect the safety concerns surrounding the vaccine to be resolved completely, just like the milk powder scandal. It&amp;rsquo;s important to learn from history and understand how the establishment of the US FDA and its comprehensive legal framework are closely linked to past incidents involving unsafe milk and dairy products. The Sanlu milk powder incident forced significant changes in China’s dairy industry. While I can’t guarantee a continuous series of events, I hope this one brings things to a halt. Progress occurs through cycles of problems arising, being solved, and then thoroughly resolved – otherwise, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of journalists? What&amp;rsquo;s the point of citizens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think the only thing each of us can do is to pay attention. But the problem is that Chinese people tend to forget easily. As I mentioned earlier, after hitting someone&amp;rsquo;s car, we just abandon it on the side of the road and run off, with no one stopping us. A large proportion of our neighbors and colleagues are like this. So change needs to be gradual. And as ordinary citizens, what we can do is pay attention and not forget. It’s not a lack of process; when people aren&amp;rsquo;t able to eat or dress properly, talking about ideals lacks persuasiveness. But once they have enough food and warm clothes, and become the world’s leading diabetes nation, the leading high blood pressure nation, and so on – many “number one” nations – you see Chinese people start running, Chinese people start dieting. Ask the ladies here, how many of you haven&amp;rsquo;t experienced the harsh reality that you don’t have the energy to diet unless you eat a good meal? That&amp;rsquo;s a small shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the same with the spiritual realm. When you’re well-fed and clothed, and start exercising or dieting, your spiritual needs gradually increase. For example, I used to smoke, but after starting to run, I suddenly realized I hadn’t had a cigarette in over 20 days – and haven’t since. Of course, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I completely quit; that feels too formal. There might be two or three cigarettes a year. When your lifestyle changes, many things shift along with it. For Chinese people, you need patience to wait for this reshuffling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more people feel unhappy, yet are unwilling to indulge in that unhappiness. While depression is on the rise, isn&amp;rsquo;t it also true that increasingly more people are seeking positive ways to live? This leads to a growth in spiritual matters. So don’t be pessimistic; it all depends on your perspective. I often see drivers cutting in line and feel frustrated. But then I quickly become optimistic because the queue on the other side is much longer now. It&amp;rsquo;s just like that – a process. Look at everyone here, willing to come to this place on a rainy evening to chat about such trivial things; isn’t that wonderful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this also a transformation? It means many things require a shift in thinking. I believe there will be much more to come, for example, you mentioned entrepreneurship – isn’t everyone an entrepreneur throughout their life? We attribute too much of a modern feel to the term &amp;ldquo;entrepreneurship,&amp;rdquo; but it has always existed. Su Shi was an entrepreneur; Li Bai was an entrepreneur. Throughout their lives, they created, and most didn&amp;rsquo;t succeed in creating a brand, which is fine. As long as you live with flavor and believe it’s worthwhile. What China particularly lacks now is a value system that recognizes good failure as another form of success. Chinese culture only accepts successful outcomes; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t accept a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;rsquo;s very difficult. There are many reasons why Chinese football doesn’t play well, and one of them is the fear of losing possession – no one wants to pass the ball to someone else, even if it means keeping it themselves. This is just a small reason though. I feel that after reaching my 30s, I wrote about patience and joy, but now at 50, there’s a bit of urgency because time passes so quickly, and many things you expect haven&amp;rsquo;t become reality. However, I also understand that for a country like China, many things are a slow process of change. You see your parents – some were oblivious to traffic lights, but occasionally you see a child pulling their father along. Things are changing, shuffling around, so you need to have patience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Overall, the country is becoming better and stronger. If people could curb their vanity, things would be even better. Looking back from the 1990s to now, the lives of families I&amp;rsquo;ve interacted with have improved significantly. There are also more wealthy individuals. In the development of a market economy, widening income inequality is unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues of social stratification and blocked upward mobility are common problems in today&amp;rsquo;s world. Our party’s contributions to the basic welfare and social security of the people should be recognized. Life will continue to improve; if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to buy a house, you can rent. Educational resource allocation is unequal, sometimes requiring choices. Decide what matters most – better job opportunities/environment or more time with family – and don’t impose your own preferences on others, including your children and family. Sit down and talk it over; life will generally get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve turned 50 this year. I never thought about it before, but now I realize I really am an old guy. This is what I looked like at 30. Didn’t feel particularly young or handsome then, but looking back at 30 now, not bad! What was the biggest life lesson at 30? Looking back. I think it&amp;rsquo;s subtraction – the keyword is subtraction. In a way, experiencing and writing about things while feeling both pain and joy is also a form of subtraction, leaving those experiences behind to start fresh on a new blank page, like running. But for me, doing subtraction—whether for myself or as a reminder to others—was truly important at 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently guiding students at Peking University, and I often tell them to focus on building their skills and experiences—the &amp;ldquo;additions&amp;rdquo;—before 30. You don’t know your potential or what opportunities life may offer. It’s not about knowing &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to do something, but rather doing it. Some people work tirelessly on accumulating experiences in their twenties, forgetting the need for “subtraction”—knowing when to let go. I believe around 30 is a crucial time—after building and exploring, you must learn to subtract. Otherwise, it’s too late. Why subtract? Not everything suits you, and not everything &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; suit you. You should try everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight lines bind you – how far can you run? They may restrain each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I was 30, I had been promoted exceptionally – in academia, that would be a professor; in journalism, a senior reporter. I received this exceptional promotion at 29. Such things are rare now, but it&amp;rsquo;s when I first felt a profound sense of confusion. When I worked on the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and received much applause, I suddenly felt something was amiss. I started asking myself: what do I really want to do? What needs to be discarded? That year, I made a very important subtraction – I stopped my program for a year, without appearing abroad. Someone advised me that in this industry, if you’re out of sight for just a month, it&amp;rsquo;s manageable; six months and people will forget you. I replied that my face must be pretty cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, we started developing new programs. After a period of challenges and triumphs, I took a full year off in 2001. Everything I&amp;rsquo;m doing today stems from the lessons learned during that time – learning to simplify. I could have pursued many avenues: sports, entertainment (E), producing, etc. But I realized I could only do news, and it was where I should be. I resigned from being the producer of three programs overnight, which led me to who I am today. It brought a sense of clarity. Just recently, talking with colleagues, I mentioned that a crucial decision I made in my late 20s wasn&amp;rsquo;t about having many options; it was about focusing on news – this deep well. There were opportunities for promotion, even to deputy director, but I declined and returned to being an ordinary person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a senior-level cadre at CCTV, and even then, not everyone was an absolute bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree graduate. You understand our system, but I rejected it. I wanted to see how far a bachelor’s degree could go—why can’t a bachelor’s degree continuously learn and lead graduate students? Yes, now I supervise graduate students, 11 every year – all a result of backtracking. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly a reflection on the past. Also, when young, it’s especially easy to feel entitled while constantly striving; any shortcoming or anything missed leaves me deeply uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to subtract as well. When you&amp;rsquo;re approaching 30, around 28 years old, watching the Olympics in 1996, I came up with a saying… In Zeng Guofan’s lengthy novel, there&amp;rsquo;s an important sentence: what is the best state of life? Zeng Guofan wanted to name his study &amp;ldquo;Hall of Seeking Deficiency.&amp;rdquo; The best time is when flowers aren&amp;rsquo;t fully open, when the moon isn&amp;rsquo;t yet full. But for ordinary people, they see this as a flaw, not perfect enough, not reaching its peak. The best way to ruin someone is to make them pursue perfection and ultimate achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world isn&amp;rsquo;t like that. A flower is at its best when it’s not fully bloomed; once it reaches full bloom, falling petals are near. Similarly, a full moon quickly fades to crescent. That&amp;rsquo;s the important push and revelation for my 30th birthday. It&amp;rsquo;s not about looking good at 40, but I feel more relaxed and free. Why question happiness instead of adhering to suits and black-and-white appearances?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forty-years-old&#34;&gt;Forty years old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a Chinese saying, &amp;ldquo;forty is the age of confusion.&amp;rdquo; It’s said that thirty is about subtraction, and forty is supposed to be a time of clarity. But I think in this era, most people are confused at forty. My midlife crisis came early—I started questioning the value of everything I&amp;rsquo;ve done around thirty-six or seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it even matter? Have I figured out what happiness is? This book was born from that confusion. You&amp;rsquo;ll find, when you turn 30, that many of your goals for happiness are tied to material possessions; the &amp;ldquo;establishing oneself by 30&amp;rdquo; refers to having education and a stable foundation. You need a car and a house, otherwise your future mother-in-law won’t agree to her daughter marrying you – it&amp;rsquo;s very materialistic. But being wise at 40 is difficult. I think ancient people probably had shorter average life expectancies, so they condensed it into 40 and declared wisdom; I&amp;rsquo;m still confused at 40, &lt;strong&gt;物质没有给我带来，我以为会带给我的幸福&lt;/strong&gt;. And that’s why so many people ask me when they turn 40, are you happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is my book titled &amp;ldquo;Waves of Happiness?&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a question mark, representing the confusion in my heart. The birth of a midlife crisis—around 40, you need to answer many questions for yourself. Around 40, talk to yourself more and read widely to find your own answers. I’m grateful that I entered the world of the Tao Te Ching in my late thirties. As I mentioned in &amp;ldquo;White Talk,&amp;rdquo; when you reach 40 and still need to think things through, if the surrounding environment doesn&amp;rsquo;t change—especially the soft environment—you leave home with a pleasant mood, only to encounter chaotic traffic lights everywhere, and everything you buy is fake, even your vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying that China has been battling two typhoons these past few days – one invisible, and one visible. The invisible typhoon is the vaccine, which impacts our sense of security. The other typhoon, rarely hitting mainland China from Shanghai, is beside the point. What you need to consider is this: you’ve improved yourself, gained many answers, but if the surrounding environment doesn&amp;rsquo;t change, will you be happy? &lt;strong&gt;我有八个字说得比较重，我觉得我们现在是道德赤字人性亏损，这才是目前最大的赤字和最大的亏损&lt;/strong&gt; Just recently, not far from here, I witnessed two cars collide; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a serious collision. The responsible driver pulled over after hitting another car and explained they would move to the side of the road. But the vehicle in front sped off, and no one stopped him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will he be a responsible father? A responsible son? Let alone a responsible citizen—and potentially your colleague. This is a moral deficit and a loss of humanity, which will inevitably affect you. No matter how important you are, unless you stay completely isolated at home, the problem is that even staying home won&amp;rsquo;t prevent your children from needing vaccinations; if you deliver food, the food itself might be problematic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how can a Chinese person learn to transform from an ordinary citizen into a responsible member of society – this is a crucial question for me personally and for our society as a whole, one I&amp;rsquo;ve been grappling with around the age of 40&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If 30 is about subtraction, and 40 is confusion, I think the word I&amp;rsquo;d give myself for 50 is curiosity. 50 is awkward – neither here nor there, with options to advance or retreat. You can either build on what you’ve achieved or simply drift towards retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I read a book that had an interesting passage: it stated that truly successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are often in their fifties and sixties—a concept quite different from our own. Just as we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t equate volunteering solely with youth, so too should China move beyond the idea that entrepreneurship is exclusively for young people. Last week, I produced a program about recruiting retired elementary and middle school teachers, who would receive an annual subsidy of two or three million yuan to teach in rural areas—and they must be excellent teachers. This marks a pioneering effort in post-retirement employment, more than just charity. However, reaching 50 still feels distant. How can we move forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifty-years-old&#34;&gt;Fifty years old
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, for people around 50, there are two challenges. The first is yourself: Are you still curious about many things? What is your worldview? I think my greatest gain at 50, or how I am living right now,&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the best thing to watch today is Tsai Chin&amp;rsquo;s concert DVD. She said something really good: &amp;ldquo;Every time I look at photos, I think my younger self was so beautiful,&amp;rdquo; but back then, twenty years ago, I never thought I looked good. That sentence has a certain flavor. I didn’t feel that way when I was 30; I thought I was quite handsome then, and focused on my flaws. But looking back after 20 years…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was once young too, with so much hair. Treat your today well; seeing you again in two years will be wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Sishi Tong said, when my legs first lost their ability to walk and I was confined to a wheelchair, I spent every day longing for the days when I could run and play basketball. Every day in that remembrance was incredibly painful.
Years later, I developed pressure sores while in my wheelchair, and was incredibly uncomfortable. I constantly longed for the times from a few years prior when I felt no pain and could sit quietly in my chair.
Years later, I developed kidney failure and now require dialysis. At this point, I miss the time when I only had bedsores, even then. If I don&amp;rsquo;t live to be 100, those first 50 years were for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not that you need to wait until 50 to understand this – people should realize it in their 30s or 40s. Everything can be easily missed. A meal during a trip, if you don’t eat it, even 30 years later, it won&amp;rsquo;t have the same taste. So my first feeling at 50 is to cherish every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing is curiosity. I realize that I can stop being curious about many things at any time, because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen and experienced so much. However, I push myself to be curious. So now, when doing a lot of things, I approach them with a sense of curiosity – can the phone be held vertically for filming? Yes, it can. Can you do live reporting? Can you make seemingly grand summits more relaxed, more fun, and leave a lasting impression? Can you use new media to spread it? All possible. I think curiosity is the most important driving force for human progress. Why can&amp;rsquo;t it be the most important driving force for an individual’s progress? A nation declines when it loses its curiosity. On a larger scale, 50 is a significant test. What kind of vested interest do you become in China at forty or fifty years old? I am very worried that many people around us, hoping to achieve their dreams when they were young, once they realize those dreams and become established figures, turn into people who obstruct others from achieving theirs. Am I right? They then treat young people and things using the very methods they used to dislike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a few years ago, I started recruiting 11 graduate students each year as a volunteer, mentoring them for two years. We&amp;rsquo;ve now had five graduating classes, totaling 55 students. It feels wonderful to be in this position of influence – you gain insights and the ability to guide them. After each day of teaching, we’d have dinner together, which doesn’t cost much. But that&amp;rsquo;s what a good mentor should do. Being a mentor can take two forms: one is like being a stepping stone. I once said, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to say thank you too much to those who helped me,&amp;rdquo; because my way of saying thank you is to treat the new generation with even greater care and dedication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it&amp;rsquo;s about paving the way for others. I hope that those who have benefited materially, economically, ideologically, and culturally – all sectors – when you achieve success, consider how you should act. Those who derailed the train yesterday become those blocking it today; history of China is full of such examples, and this will continue if things don&amp;rsquo;t change, perhaps even more so. Therefore, I urge all established beneficiaries to return to the mindset they had when they were young – what kind of people did they want to encounter? Perhaps I haven’t done enough, but at least I am thinking, doing, and speaking about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Allocator for standard library containers</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/standard-library-container-memory-allocator/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2019 13:26:19 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/standard-library-container-memory-allocator/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Custom allocators can improve performance, enhance memory efficiency, and address issues with frequent small memory allocations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cause&#34;&gt;Cause
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on network packet development, which requires frequent allocation and release of small memory blocks. I initially considered using a memory pool but examined existing implementations and found this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/cacay/MemoryPool&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://github.com/cacay/MemoryPool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the interface, I was quite puzzled by this memory pool&amp;rsquo;s implementation—the concept of &lt;code&gt;MemoryPool&lt;/code&gt;的实现逻辑，是在申请固定大小的内存空间。看过boost的内存池接口，提供的是一个模板，用的时候进行实例化。正巧这个库已经有文章进行过介绍，提到了__INLINE_CODE_1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;wikihttpszhwikipediaorgwikie58886e9858de599a8_c2b2b&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E5%99%A8_%28C%2B%2B%29&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In C++ programming, an allocator is a crucial component of the C++ standard library. Containers (such as linked lists and sets) are data structures defined in the C++ library that share a common characteristic: their size can change at runtime. Dynamic memory allocation is essential to achieve this, and allocators handle memory allocation and deallocation requests for containers. In other words, an allocator encapsulates the low-level details of memory management for Standard Template Library (STL) containers. By default, the C++ standard library uses its own generic allocator, but programmers can also customize their own allocators as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allocator was originally invented by Alexander Stepanov as part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) with the goal of creating a way to make the library more flexible and independent of the underlying data model, allowing programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types within the library. However, when incorporating the STL into the C++ standard, the C++ standards committee realized that complete abstraction of the data model would result in unacceptable performance losses. As a compromise, restrictions on allocators were tightened in the standard. Consequently, the current standard describes allocators with significantly less customization than Stepanov originally envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While customization of allocators is limited, custom allocators are often necessary to manage access to different memory spaces (such as shared and recycled memory) or to improve performance when using memory pools. Furthermore, in programs with frequent small allocations, introducing a specialized allocator can yield significant benefits in terms of memory footprint and runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-just-paste-the-text-after-使用需求httpszhwikipediaorgwikie58886e9858de599a8_c2b2b&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are! Just paste the text after &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E5%99%A8_%28C%2B%2B%29&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;使用需求&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One primary reason for defining custom allocators is to improve performance. Utilizing a dedicated custom allocator can enhance program performance, increase memory efficiency, or both [4][8]. The default allocator uses the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; operator to allocate storage space [Reference 5], often implemented using C&amp;rsquo;s heap allocation functions (malloc()) [9]. While the default allocator generally performs well when allocating memory for containers requiring large, infrequent allocations (e.g., vectors, double-ended queues) [8], it can be inefficient when used with containers that require frequent small allocations (e.g., associative containers and doubly linked lists) [4][9]. Furthermore, malloc()-based default allocators suffer from issues such as poor locality of reference [4] and potential memory fragmentation [4][9].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, this section is like a &amp;ldquo;I Have a Dream&amp;rdquo; speech for the standard&amp;rsquo;s approach to allocators. Before that dream comes true, programmers concerned with portability will limit themselves to stateless custom allocators.
Scott Meyers, &lt;em&gt;Effective STL&lt;/em&gt;
Given this situation, memory pool allocators are often used to address frequent small allocations [8]. Unlike the default &amp;ldquo;on-demand&amp;rdquo; allocation approach, with a memory pool allocator, the program pre-allocates a large block of memory (the “memory pool”), and the custom allocator simply returns a pointer to memory within the pool when an allocation is requested; no actual deallocation is performed during object destruction but is deferred until the end of the memory pool&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle [Note 1] [8].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of &amp;ldquo;custom allocators&amp;rdquo; has been extensively discussed by C++ experts and authors, such as Scott Meyers&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Effective STL&amp;rdquo; and Andrei Alexandrescu&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Modern C++ Design.&amp;rdquo; Meyers observed that if all instances of an allocator for a given type T must be equal, then portable allocator instances must not contain state. While the C++ standard encourages library implementers to support allocators with state [reference 4], Meyers calls this related passage a “seemingly wonderful idea” but almost empty rhetoric, and considers the restriction on allocators &amp;ldquo;too strict&amp;rdquo; [4]. For example, STL&amp;rsquo;s list allows the splice method, where nodes of one list object A can be directly moved into another list object B, requiring that the memory allocated by A’s allocator can be released by B’s allocator, thus inferring that the allocator instances of A and B must be equal. Meyers concludes that allocators are best defined as types using static methods. For example, according to the C++ standard, an allocator must provide an other class template that implements the rebind method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in &amp;ldquo;The C++ Programming Language,&amp;rdquo; Bjarne Stroustrup argues that “strictly limiting the allocator to avoid object information differences” is not a significant issue (in essence), and notes that many allocators do not require state; performance can even be better without it. He proposes three use cases for custom allocators: memory pool allocators, shared-memory allocators, and garbage collection allocators, and demonstrates an implementation utilizing an internal memory pool for rapid allocation/deallocation of small amounts of memory. However, he also mentions that such optimization may already be achieved in the example allocator he provides [3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another use of custom allocators is debugging memory-related errors [10]. This can be achieved by writing an allocator that allocates extra memory during allocation to store debug information. Such an allocator not only ensures that memory is allocated/deallocated by the same type of allocator, but also helps protect the program from buffer overflows [11].&lt;/p&gt;</description>
