        <description>&lt;p&gt;China’s population control policies, while limiting growth and curbing family-style development, have disrupted traditional social structures, suppressed the expansion of family-owned businesses and political dynasty power, presenting a unique case compared to South Korean conglomerates and Indian family monopolies. Now that birth restrictions are being relaxed, despite facing challenges such as low fertility rates, it’s crucial to be wary of new monopoly risks and seek balance through multiple avenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;one-the-disjunction-between-population-control-and-family-style-development&#34;&gt;One: The Disjunction Between Population Control and Family-Style Development
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family planning policy, which has been a fundamental national strategy in China for nearly forty years, has achieved significant direct results. Data shows that from 1978 to 2007, the natural growth rate of China’s population declined from 12‰ to 5.2‰, resulting in a reduction of over 40 million people, and the proportion of the Chinese population worldwide decreased from 22.2% to 20.1%. This sharp decline in population growth profoundly reshaped family structures within Chinese society. Taking family-owned enterprises as an example, after the implementation of the family planning policy, the number of children born by business owners declined significantly: before the policy, the proportion of those having three or more children reached 40.63%, and after the policy it plummeted to 18.46%, the proportion of single sons born increased from 6.25% to 32.31%. This structural change directly reduced the range of potential internal successors for family-owned enterprises, objectively suppressing their generational expansion capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Korea and India, the differences are significant. Although Korea did not implement strict family planning policies, its birth rate has remained low (0.7 in 2023), however, its chaebols have maintained control over the national economy through cross-shareholdings and tax avoidance mechanisms. The total revenue of the top five chaebols accounts for more than 50% of Korea’s GDP, with Samsung Group alone accounting for 20% of the country&amp;rsquo;s GDP. India, on the other hand, presents a different picture: 79% of economic output is contributed by family-owned enterprises, and six major conglomerates control key sectors such as telecommunications and steel, with twenty top companies earning 80% of national corporate profits. The core of this difference lies in the fact that China’s family planning policy, through limiting family size, has weakened the human resources base for family-owned enterprise expansion from the source, while Korea and India have been able to sustain their influence in economic sectors due to different policy environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;two-monopoly-restraint-and-social-structural-transformation&#34;&gt;Two. Monopoly Restraint and Social Structural Transformation
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the economic sector is particularly evident in its suppression of monopoly phenomena. Due to the reduced number of children within Chinese family businesses, the formation of Han-Indian style conglomerates like those led by chaebols was difficult. Taking Korea as an example, chaebols maintained control through “circular investment,” with the Samsung family holding only 2% of the group’s shares but controlling the entire operation through complex equity structures. In China, after the family planning policy, family businesses generally faced the dilemma of “passing down from father to son,” often necessitating the introduction of professional managers or implementing equity diversification reforms. According to a湃新闻 (Papare News) study, the proportion of female successors in family businesses after family planning increased from 13.85% to 34.21%, and the education level of these successors significantly improved, with the percentage of college graduates rising from 43.75% to 98.46%. While this transformation has not completely eliminated family control, it has significantly reduced the possibility of a single family monopolizing the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the social structural level, the family planning policy accelerated the disintegration of traditional family core models. The average household size in China decreased from 4.41 people/household in 1982 to 2.62 people/household in 2020, weakening the family’s functions in areas such as economics, education, and social support. In contrast, India maintains a family size of around 4 people, with the caste system deeply intertwined with family power, leading to low social mobility. China&amp;rsquo;s transformation of household structure created space for individualism, with the number of single adult citizens reaching 240 million in 2023, and a trend of “one-person economy” emerging in the consumer market – further diminishing the influence of family economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;three-decentralization-of-power-in-the-political-sphere&#34;&gt;Three. Decentralization of Power in the Political Sphere
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the political landscape has been profound. Traditionally, family power structures had infiltrated grassroots politics through bloodlines and kinship relationships. For example, the 161 political families in Henan’s Xinye County virtually controlled all government departments, with 20% of cadres at deputy-level or above belonging to “officer’s children.” However, after the implementation of the family planning policy, shrinking family sizes limited the expansion of family networks. Research from Peking University showed that the number of offspring of officials decreased after family planning, and the complexity of family political networks significantly declined. Furthermore, the policy-driven promotion of education (the average years of schooling increased from 5.2 in 1982 to 10.9 in 2023) facilitated social mobility, weakening the monopoly of family power over political resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison with South Korea and India, the deep entanglement between Korean conglomerates and politics (such as Samsung Group executives engaging in bribery with government officials) and the hereditary family politics under the Indian caste system highlighted the uniqueness of China’s policy. China objectively reduced the possibility of power succession through the family planning policy. Despite the presence of family phenomena in county-level politics, the overall trend is towards the decentralization of the power structure. During the 2025 National People&amp;rsquo;s Congress meeting, a CPPCC member proposed renaming “The Law on Population and Family Planning” to “The Law on Population and Reproduction,” fully opening up childbirth – a move that may further influence the future evolution of the political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;four-challenges-and-opportunities-following-policy-adjustments&#34;&gt;Four, Challenges and Opportunities Following Policy Adjustments
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the 2016 comprehensive two-child policy and the 2021 three-child policy marked a significant shift in China’s birth policies. However, the effects were limited: In 2022, the birth rate was only 1.18, far below the replacement level (2.1). The relaxation of birth restrictions had a dual impact on family-owned enterprises: On one hand, some entrepreneurs may strengthen their family succession capabilities through multiple births, such as Zong Qinghui, the daughter of Zhong Quehui of Wahaha Group in Zhejiang, who took over as the sole heir; on the other hand, high childcare costs (the average cost of raising a child to 18 years old in first-tier cities reaches 10 million yuan) and declining fertility intentions among professional women limited the expansion of family size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the economic sphere, relaxing birth restrictions may give rise to new monopoly forms. The three-child policy has accelerated the concentration of the maternal and childcare industry, with the market size of infant and toddler care expected to reach 1621.3 billion yuan in 2025. Leading companies have consolidated smaller manufacturers through mergers and acquisitions, resulting in a CR5 market concentration exceeding 55%. This increase in concentration may bring efficiency, but it also needs to be wary of new monopoly risks. The government must seek a balance between encouraging births and preventing market concentration, such as strengthening regulation through antitrust laws while providing childcare subsidies (such as Hangzhou’s three-child families receiving a monthly milk powder subsidy of 3000 yuan) to reduce family burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the political sphere, relaxing birth restrictions may have subtle impacts on family power structures. Although it is unlikely to restore traditional family political networks in the short term, from a long-term perspective, multi-child families may form new influence in grassroots politics. Therefore, improving personnel selection mechanisms and strengthening supervision (such as establishing a cadre relative appointment avoidance system) are still crucial for preventing hereditary power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;five-international-mirroring-and-future-outlook&#34;&gt;Five. International Mirroring and Future Outlook
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiences of South Korea and India demonstrate that the ebb and flow of family power is closely linked to policy orientations. South Korea achieved economic takeoff by supporting conglomerates, but at the cost of social inequality; India’s failure to implement effective policies to curb family monopolies has exacerbated wealth disparity. China&amp;rsquo;s population control policy effectively suppressed the expansion of family powers while simultaneously creating problems such as an aging population and labor shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, China needs to find a new balance between population policy and socio-economic development. On one hand, it should increase birth rates through fertility support policies (such as extending maternity leave and building accessible childcare institutions); on the other hand, it must strengthen antitrust enforcement to prevent family businesses from forming new monopolies through capital operations. In the political sphere, further progress is needed in grassroots democracy construction, strengthening oversight mechanisms, and ensuring transparency in governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, population control policies were a key driver of social change in China, with impacts far exceeding the realm of population. They reshaped family structures, economic models, and the political landscape, providing a path for China to avoid falling into the trap of family monopolies seen in Korea and India. As policies are adjusted, balancing efficiency and equity, freedom and order within the new demographic context will be a long-term challenge facing China.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trade war abruptly called a pause</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 19:07:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of trade war tariffs in 2025 presented a “escalation – counter-repressive measures – negotiations” cycle, with the US-China rivalry shifting from tariff confrontation to competition over rules. Despite short-term easing that alleviated market pressure, long-term uncertainty persists, and it’s crucial to monitor WTO rulings, supply chain adjustments, and geopolitical shifts&amp;rsquo; ongoing impact on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don’t earn money beyond their own perception; the stock market crash triggered by the launch of the trade war this year has largely recovered, but countless small investors have been buried along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2025 Trade War Tariff Timeline Overview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a timeline of the trade war tariff events, combining key events involving the US and China, and other countries, to present the dynamic evolution of tariff policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;one-april-2025--comprehensive-tariff-upgrade-and-countermeasures&#34;&gt;One: April 2025 – Comprehensive Tariff Upgrade and Countermeasures
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Tariffs on China&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2nd:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration signed Executive Order No. 14257, announcing the imposition of a 34% “retaliatory tariff” on goods shipped from China to the U.S., covering products originating from Hong Kong and Macau.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 8th:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States further increased the “retaliatory tariff” rate on Chinese goods from 34% to 84%, signing Executive Orders No. 14259 and 14266 to impose tariffs on additional products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 10th:&lt;/strong&gt; The White House amended the executive order, increasing the total tariff amount on Chinese goods to 145% and raising the rate on small packages (such as goods priced below $800 from 90% to 120%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s Countermeasures&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 4th:&lt;/strong&gt; China announced a 34% tariff on all goods originating in the United States, covering sectors such as agricultural products, automobiles, and energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 10th:&lt;/strong&gt; China raised the retaliatory tariff rate from 34% to 84%, synchronizing with the U.S. side’s escalation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 12th:&lt;/strong&gt; China cancelled the 91% tariffs imposed on US goods (corresponding to some of the tariffs cancelled by the US side) and suspended the implementation of the 24% tariff for 90 days, retaining a 10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Countries’ Tariff Game&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S.-Canada Trade War:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum products, and Canada retaliated by imposing taxes on US goods worth $2.98 billion CAD, and filed a WTO dispute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EU and Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; The EU imposed maximum 25% tariffs on U.S. goods, while Japan expressed concern about auto tariffs on the United States, calling the trade war “harming both sides.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-may-2025-geneva-talks-and-tariff-de-escalation&#34;&gt;II. May 2025: Geneva Talks and Tariff De-escalation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US-China High-Level Trade Talks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 10-11&lt;/strong&gt;: The US and China held a 16-hour meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, reaching the “Joint Statement on the US-China Economic Talks.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 12&lt;/strong&gt;: Both sides announced a suspension of some tariffs:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United States suspended its 24% tariff on Chinese goods (90 days), retaining 10%, and rescinded the additional tariffs imposed on April 8th and 9th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China simultaneously suspended its 24% retaliatory tariffs, retaining 10%, and lifted non-tariff measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishment of a Consultation Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;: Both sides agreed to hold regular trade consultations in China, the United States, or a third country, focusing on tariff reduction and rulemaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Impact &amp;amp; Policy Adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Domestic Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;: High tariffs led to the closure of small and medium-sized enterprises (such as Amazon sellers forced to close due to tariff surges) and fueled inflationary expectations (core PCE is expected to rise to 3.3%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China Rare Earth Countermeasures&lt;/strong&gt;: China strengthened controls on rare earth exports, cracked down on smuggling, impacting US defense and new energy industries, which were granted exemptions on tariffs for key minerals such as rare earths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-other-key-events-and-long-term-impacts&#34;&gt;III. Other Key Events and Long-Term Impacts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WTO and Multilateral Reactions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canada and China both lodged WTO disputes against the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and “retaliatory tariffs,” alleging violations of non-discrimination principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTO Director-General Azevedo warned that U.S. tariffs could cause a 1% contraction in global trade volumes by 2025, exacerbating difficulties for developing countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exemption Lists and Industry Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Excluded Goods:&lt;/strong&gt; A 37-page list covering strategic materials such as rare earths, graphite, and medical CT balls exposed supply chain vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto Tariffs:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imported automobiles, leading to an estimated 2% decline in global auto production and a 9% reduction in North American output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political and Strategic Maneuvering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration attempted to reshape the international trade order through “retaliatory tariffs,” but was criticized as unilateral bullying, triggering backlash from allies (such as the EU and Japan).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China responded to protectionism with efforts to expand market access (such as the Cross-Border e-Commerce Expo and zero-tariff commitments), attracting cooperation from developing countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;April 12th&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The United States waived some goods (such as technology products), China lifted 91% of the counter-rebalancing tariffs.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;May 10-11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;US-China talks in Geneva, reaching a joint statement on suspending tariffs of 24% (90 days).&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;May 12th&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Both sides announced a suspension of tariffs and the establishment of a consultation mechanism, easing trade tensions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;five-trends-and-challenges&#34;&gt;Five. Trends and Challenges
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Term Relief and Long-Term Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; The suspension of U.S.-China tariffs sent positive signals, but structural issues (such as high technology and energy) remain, with midterm elections or policy continuity impacting the medium term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Supply Chain Restructuring:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies are accelerating adjustments to their supply chains, with Mexico and Southeast Asia benefiting from “nearshoring,” but rising costs could dampen recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilateral Mechanism Dilemmas:&lt;/strong&gt; The WTO dispute resolution mechanism is limited, regional trade agreements (such as the U.S.-UK agreement) are emerging as alternative options, but this exacerbates fragmentation.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>2020-2025 Jiangxi Province Special Postdoctoral and National Civil Service Teacher Recruitment Data: Trends and Insights into Transformation</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/jiangxi-specialist-and-national-teacher-recruitment-trends-2020-2025/</link>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/jiangxi-specialist-and-national-teacher-recruitment-trends-2020-2025/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;2020-2025 Years: The recruitment of teachers in Jiangxi Province shows a significant reduction trend: the number of specially appointed teachers decreased sharply from 6,617 to 32 (a decrease of 99.5%), and the number of national cadre teachers decreased from 11,324 to 2,146 (a decrease of 81.1%). The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, mathematics, and English) remained stable but declined in total volume; while the proportions of music, art, and physical education increased, the absolute number was limited (e.g., in 2025, they only recruited 2 people each). Policy-wise, &amp;ldquo;one withdrawal, one replacement&amp;rdquo; personnel adjustments have tightened, with teacher resources leaning towards vocational training and remote areas, traditional primary and secondary school positions have significantly reduced, and some subjects are planning for zero recruitment in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruitment numbers of specially appointed teachers in Jiangxi Province over the past five years have been collected, with data sorted by subject and compiled into a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— ——————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on recruitment announcements and publicly available data released by the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and other official agencies, the following summarizes the recruitment situation for contracted teachers and civil servant teachers from 2020-2025. Please note that &lt;strong&gt;2025 data represents planned recruitment numbers&lt;/strong&gt;, and some years’ subject breakdowns are not fully disclosed; subjects marked as “unspecified” in the table represent total figures or missing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-data-explanation&#34;&gt;III. Data Explanation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Source&lt;/strong&gt;: Recruitment announcements and official statistics from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education and the Department of Human Resources and Social Security over the past years (actual recruitment numbers for 2020-2024, planned numbers for 2025).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject Categories&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special Teachers focus on subjects at rural primary and secondary education stages; in 2025, only a small number of core positions will be retained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Personnel Teachers cover all academic levels, with a more comprehensive subject setting including preschool education and special education (due to data not being segmented, these were not listed separately).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trend Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharp Decline in Total Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;: The recruitment quota for Special Teachers decreased by 99.5% compared to 2020 in 2025, and the recruitment quota for National Personnel Teachers decreased by 81.1%, reflecting demographic changes and adjustments in educational resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject Hotness&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, Mathematics, English) remained stable but declined year on year in terms of recruitment numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjects such as Music, Art, and Physical Education, as well as Information Technology, saw an increase in their proportions, but the absolute number was limited (e.g., in 2025, Music and Art each recruited only 2 people).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some subjects (such as English) experienced freezes due to a decrease in student numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Background&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightening of Personnel Quotas&lt;/strong&gt;: The “One Out, One In” policy is being implemented, strictly controlling the addition of new quotas; in 2024, the proportion of non-quota positions reached 68.6%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Adjustment&lt;/strong&gt;: Teacher resources are leaning towards vocational education and remote areas, with significant reductions in recruitment to traditional primary and secondary schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The “Tiangong” (Heavenly Palace) incident in medical education and the Butterfly Effect of Dong Xi Ying’s case</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-and-the-butterfly-effect-of-dong-xiying-incident/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 01:08:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-and-the-butterfly-effect-of-dong-xiying-incident/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Beijing Children’s Hospital “4+4” project (4 years non-medical bachelor&amp;rsquo;s + 4 years medical doctorate) focuses on interdisciplinary elite cultivation. The exposure of Dong Xi Ying’s case in 2025 revealed her reliance on family background (medical/scientific research lineage) to gain entry into the program, raising concerns about the ambiguity of her qualifications, allegations of plagiarism in her dissertation, and exposing contradictions between its elite recruitment model and fairness, as well as ongoing debates regarding shortened study durations and clinical internship training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompts&#34;&gt;Prompts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog: Harmony 4+4 Origin and Development, Core: A Corner of Tian Gong, Seen by Mortals, Dong Xiaojie&amp;rsquo;s Family Background, Normal Medical Doctor Cannot Graduate in Eight Years, Dong Xiaojie’s Family Background &amp;amp; Educational Background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harmony-44-deconstructing-medical-educations-tiangong-heavenly-palace&#34;&gt;Harmony 4+4: Deconstructing Medical Education’s “Tiangong” (Heavenly Palace)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “4+4” project at the Beijing Union Medical College, launched in 2018, has been viewed as China’s “Tiangong” (Heavenly Palace) in medical education. This project, designed to mimic the American medical education system, adopted the philosophy of “nurturing multidisciplinary individuals, those who love medicine, and talents from across the nation.” It aimed to create a rift within traditional Chinese medical education by focusing on: &lt;strong&gt;replacing the traditional 5+3+3 (five-year bachelor’s degree + three-year master’s degree + three-year doctoral degree) model with four years of non-medical undergraduate education plus four years of medical doctorate training,&lt;/strong&gt; to cultivate cross-disciplinary leadership talent in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model&amp;rsquo;s “Tiangong” attribute is reflected across three dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elite Recruitment:&lt;/strong&gt; Early on, applicants were required to come from universities ranked within the top 50 by QS/Times/US News or among the top 10 (e.g., Barnard College) in US News’s liberal arts and sciences rankings. Although later relaxed to the top 100, a GPA of 3.6 or higher, or ranking within the top 30 of their class, was still required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internationalized Training Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; The project utilized American-style organ-system integrated courses and PBL (Problem-Based Learning) teaching methods. Students were expected to complete core courses such as anatomy and pathology within four years and participate in clinical internships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controversial Quality Output:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite a slightly lower passing rate on the physician licensing exam (95.2%) compared to the traditional eight-year model (98.5%), graduates predominantly entered Union Medical College hospitals, with their career development showing no significant difference from traditional pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dong-xiyi-incident-peering-through-the-heavenly-palace-crack--a-glimpse-of-privilege&#34;&gt;Dong Xiyi Incident: Peering Through the &amp;ldquo;Heavenly Palace&amp;rdquo; Crack – A Glimpse of Privilege
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, the extramarital affair involving Xiao Fei, a thoracic surgeon at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, triggered an investigation into the “mysterious veil” surrounding the Covariance 4+4 project. The background and credentials of Dong Xiyi, the central figure in the scandal, sparked three key questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambiguity Regarding Educational Background:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Over Undergraduate Institution:&lt;/strong&gt; Dong Xiyi claimed to have graduated from Columbia University, but her actual enrollment was at Barnard College (ranked 14th among top liberal arts colleges according to US News in 2025). Despite the college meeting Covariance’s requirement of “top 20 liberal arts schools,” her diploma simultaneously listed both &amp;ldquo;Barnard College&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Columbia University,&amp;rdquo; which could easily be misinterpreted as a Columbia University graduate within the domestic recruitment market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Over Professional Field:&lt;/strong&gt; An economics undergraduate degree combined with a clinical medicine doctorate is considered to align with the 4+4 project’s positioning of “multi-disciplinary background,” but it has been questioned for lacking foundational pre-medical courses. Her doctoral dissertation, &amp;ldquo;Research on Multi-modal Image Fusion Technology in Medical Imaging Analysis,&amp;rdquo; was alleged to closely resemble a patent developed by North Korea Tech, raising concerns about academic misconduct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Characteristics of Family Background:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monopoly of Academic Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Her father served as Secretary of the China Metallurgical Construction Research Institute, and her mother was Deputy Director of the North Korea Tech Engineering Technology Institute. Her grandfather was a professor in Covariance’s imaging field, and her paternal grandparents were foreign professors in the materials field. This “medical + research + university” composite family background provided her with implicit resources such as recommendation letters (requiring recommendations from two biomedical associate professors) and research collaborations (such as North Korea Tech patents).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jump in Career Path:&lt;/strong&gt; She switched from thoracic surgery during internship to urology, and her research direction spanned bone and joint, digestive system, and imaging fields, raising questions about “paved the way for resources.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnified Dispute Over Length of Study:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationality of Time Compression:&lt;/strong&gt; Traditional medical doctorates require 11 years (5+3+3), while the 4+4 project compressed this time to 8 years. Although Covariance emphasized “course integration” and “early clinical practice,” some doctors pointed out that her clinical internship period (12 months) was less than the traditional eight-year program (18 months), potentially hindering skill accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Over Reduced Internship:&lt;/strong&gt; Some internship bases allowed 4+4 graduates to reduce their internship by one year, raising concerns about disrupting industry fairness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-medical-education-quagmire-behind-the-controversy&#34;&gt;The Medical Education Quagmire Behind the Controversy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dong Xiying incident reflects deep contradictions within Chinese medical education:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict Between Elitism and Equity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “application-assessment” model of the 4+4 program is essentially a transplant of the American medical school model, but China lacks standardized exams like MCAT, relying instead on subjective evaluations such as letters of recommendation and research experience, which are susceptible to influence from family background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data shows that in the 2023 graduating class of 4+4 students, 30% came from Qingbei Fuzhou (Jilin, Beijing, Zhejiang), and 25% from overseas top universities; the impact of family background on applications is significant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reality of Curriculum Reform:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cost of Time Compression:&lt;/strong&gt; 4+4 students produce significantly fewer research outputs (such as the number of papers) than traditional eight-year programs, and are accused of “prioritizing clinical work over research.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Division in Industry Recognition:&lt;/strong&gt; Three-class hospitals prioritize the reputation of Covance (commonly known as &amp;ldquo;Kohe&amp;rdquo;), while基层医院 (jīchéng yīyuàn - primary care hospitals) maintain a cautious attitude towards the clinical abilities of 4+4 graduates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Misguided Pursuit of International Alignment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The American 4+4 model requires passing the MCAT exam and completing 3-7 years of residency, while China’s 4+4 program simplifies both admission and residency stages, leading to “form resembling substance but lacking true substance.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data from the Ministry of Education shows that in 2024, the national enrollment of medical doctors under the 4+4 program was less than 5%, and its large-scale promotion still faces resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-reconstructing-the-tiangong-order-for-medical-education&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Reconstructing the &amp;ldquo;Tiangong&amp;rdquo; Order for Medical Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding the Keho 4+4 project fundamentally represents a collision between elite education and public expectations. When a corner of “Tiangong” (the Palace of Heaven) was glimpsed by mortals, it exposed not just isolated instances of flaws, but deeper contradictions within the entire medical education system. Future reforms must focus on three levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement Transparent Selection Mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; Introduce standardized exams (such as a Chinese version of MCAT) to reduce the influence of subjective factors like letters of recommendation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extend Clinical Training Cycles:&lt;/strong&gt; Restore clinical training cycles for 4+4 graduates to 3 years, ensuring that clinical competence is achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen Process Oversight:&lt;/strong&gt; Establish an academic integrity review mechanism and conduct rigorous originality verification for interdisciplinary research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical education’s “Tiangong” should not be the privilege of a few; it should truly be a cradle for nurturing medical elites. Only when fairness in selection mechanisms, rigor in the training process, and norms in professional development are comprehensively guaranteed will this “Tiangong experiment” in medical education truly take root and flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wide Base Exponential Fixed Investment (also known as “Buy and Hold”): Brokerage ETF, Heng Seng Tech Index</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/broad-based-index-etf-investing/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 21:58:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/broad-based-index-etf-investing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve always wanted to do things, like buying a suitable blue-chip stock and just letting it sit, waiting for it to drop so I could see the situation and not add more if it rose, but ultimately never managed to execute that. It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to find an appropriate broad market index fund – buy an ETF instead. My current plan is: a brokerage ETF and the Hong Kong Technology Index ETF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of trading strategy described above has a professional name: bottom-up buying during a downtrend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As for what’s next, my plan is to completely practice this by choosing a broad market index fund that can outperform the returns of regular savings accounts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brokerage-etfs&#34;&gt;Brokerage ETFs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brokerage ETF is an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) whose primary investment target is Chinese securities companies. It primarily invests in the listed stocks of Chinese securities companies in the stock market. Brokerage ETFs typically track a specific brokerage company index, such as the China Securities Brokerage Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I previously bought one, but it was at a peak and ultimately resulted in losses, so I liquidated my position. In the Chinese market, whenever there’s a bull run, brokerage companies are bound to rise – and by how much, depends on investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-tech-index&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Tech Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index is an equity index launched by the Hong Kong Exchange, designed to reflect the overall performance of the technology industry in Hong Kong markets. The index includes major technology companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, covering areas such as internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 20, 2025, the top ten constituents of the Hang Seng Tech Index (code: 800700) and their weightings are listed below (data sourced from multiple authoritative sources):&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;09961.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 4.48%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Weighting:&lt;/strong&gt; Approximately 66.6% (Some sources show the top ten weighting between 68%-69%, due to differences in statistical timing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-notes&#34;&gt;Key Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight Cap Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; The Hang Seng Tech Index sets an 8% weight limit for individual stocks. For example, before the adjustment on March 2025, SMIC’s weighting exceeded 8%, but was subsequently passively reduced to comply with the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constituent Stock Adjustments:&lt;/strong&gt; On May 16, 2025, the Hang Seng Index Company announced that BYD ( &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://01211.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;01211.HK&lt;/a&gt; ) will be included in the index and that Ruyi Group (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://00772.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;00772.HK&lt;/a&gt;) will be excluded. The adjustment will take effect on June 6th. Therefore, the current (May 20th) constituent stocks are based on the pre-adjustment list, and BYD has not yet been included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry Distribution:&lt;/strong&gt; Among the top ten constituent stocks, internet technology companies (such as Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan) dominate, with new energy vehicles (Xiaomi, Ideal) and semiconductors (SMIC) having significant weights, reflecting the index’s coverage of technology and the new economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Timeliness:&lt;/strong&gt; Differences in data from different sources are mainly due to differences in statistical timing points. For example, the data shown in March 2025 shows that the top ten combined accounted for approximately 69.4%, while the data on May 14th was 68.82%, reflecting the dynamic impact of market fluctuations on weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;short-put-cover&#34;&gt;Short Put Cover
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Short Put Cover” is an investment strategy that refers to a trader’s proactive buying of stocks in a declining price trend, anticipating the stock price approaching its bottom and aiming to reduce their average cost per share. This approach falls under “short-side trading,” which involves taking opposing positions before the market has clearly established a bottom. Specifically, investors often employ a “pyramiding” or “tiered accumulation” strategy, gradually increasing their purchase volume as the stock price declines, thereby reducing their average cost basis. For example, initially buying a certain number of shares, if the price continues to fall, the investor increases the purchase volume at a lower price, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce Cost Basis:&lt;/strong&gt; By purchasing in batches during a downtrend, the average cost per share is reduced, creating conditions for future profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Positioning:&lt;/strong&gt; Establishing positions before the market reverses can yield larger gains when the market rebounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; If the stock price continues to fall, it could lead to greater losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Tie-Up:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires sufficient capital to support continued covering and may face situations where funds are long-term locked up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to “long-side trading,” which involves buying after the market trend is clear and there are signs of a price rebound, the short-side strategy carries lower risk but may miss out on some initial gains during a rally. Therefore, investors should choose a suitable trading strategy based on their risk tolerance, financial situation, and market judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory&#34;&gt;Valuation Theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuation theory is a core concept in finance that aims to assess the intrinsic value of assets or companies, providing a basis for investment decisions. Through valuation, investors can determine whether the current market price of an asset is reasonable and develop appropriate investment strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Valuation Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by an asset over its future period and discounts these cash flows to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The DCF method emphasizes intrinsic value and is suitable for evaluating companies with stable and predictable earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative Valuation Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method assesses a company’s relative value by comparing it to other companies in the same industry based on valuation metrics such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, and Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio. The relative valuation method is straightforward and widely used for quick assessments and industry comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asset-Based Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method determines a company’s value by evaluating its net asset value – the total assets minus liabilities. The asset-based method is suitable for asset-oriented companies, such as real estate firms or capital-intensive businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications of Valuation Theory:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Decisions:&lt;/strong&gt; Through valuation, investors can identify undervalued or overvalued assets and develop buy or sell strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate Mergers &amp;amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;amp;A):&lt;/strong&gt; In M&amp;amp;A transactions, valuation is key to determining the transaction price and influences the success or failure of the deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Reporting:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies need to assess the fair value of their assets and liabilities to ensure the accuracy and transparency of financial statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that valuation results are influenced by various factors, including market conditions, company operations, and macroeconomic indicators. Therefore, when conducting a valuation, it is necessary to consider these factors in combination with both qualitative and quantitative analysis to achieve more accurate assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AI Development Over Two Years: Somewhat similar to the state before a Docker release – fragmented and rapidly evolving.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-like-docker-pre-release/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:16:37 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-like-docker-pre-release/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been one of the most hotly debated topics in the technology field in recent years, particularly over the past two years, with AI technology experiencing rapid advancements. Whether it’s deep learning, natural language processing, or computer vision and automated decision systems, the application scenarios for AI are constantly emerging. However, despite continuous technological breakthroughs, AI still faces a bottleneck similar to that of a Docker release – a lack of a killer app to truly ignite the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article: AI has developed for two years, which is somewhat like the state of Docker’s pre-release, lacking a killer application, based on existing technologies, create a perfect landing scenario, Docker did not use too many new technologies, but the overall solution is reasonable, and it changes the workflow of operations and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-development-status-the-technology-is-mature-but-applications-still-need-breakthroughs&#34;&gt;AI Development Status: The Technology is Mature, but Applications Still Need Breakthroughs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, AI has made significant progress in the past two years. Whether it’s OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT series models or Google’s BERT and DeepMind’s Alpha series, AI processing capabilities have far exceeded previous expectations. Particularly in the field of natural language processing, models like GPT-4 not only possess powerful generative abilities but also demonstrate astonishing performance in understanding and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite technological advancements, AI&amp;rsquo;s implementation in practical applications faces certain challenges. Similar to Docker’s state before its release, although AI has enormous potential, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet been a truly widespread and industry-changing killer app. People are talking about the prospects of AI, but they may not be able to find an application that can directly bring about revolutionary changes. Many AI applications remain in their initial stages of experimentation, and most require further integration and optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker-and-ai-parallels-technology-doesnt-have-to-be-innovation-its-about-the-solution&#34;&gt;Docker and AI Parallels: Technology Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Have to Be Innovation, It’s About the Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at Docker’s release history, we can readily see many similarities between the technological environment at the time and the current state of AI development. Before Docker, container technology wasn’t a new concept; early technologies like LXC (Linux Containers) and virtualization already possessed the basic capabilities for containerization. However, Docker didn&amp;rsquo;t introduce disruptive technology itself. Instead, it presented a simpler, more intuitive, and efficient solution through the clever integration and optimization of existing technologies. This solution didn’t rely on revolutionary technological breakthroughs, but rather addressed many pain points in software deployment, scaling, and management processes, significantly simplifying the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the AI field is facing a similar situation. While current AI technology isn&amp;rsquo;t “new,” achieving truly large-scale applications still requires a perfect implementation scenario – just like Docker, integrating and optimizing existing technologies to form a reasonable application solution. Killer AI applications may not rely on entirely new technological breakthroughs, but rather on how to integrate existing technologies to solve practical business pain points and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-ais-docker-moment&#34;&gt;How to Find AI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Docker Moment&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly enable the widespread adoption of AI technology, we need to focus on several key areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Exploration of Practical Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;
Currently, many AI applications are still largely experimental and lack large-scale real-world implementation.  For example, while AI customer service and intelligent recommendations are widely used, their functionality is often limited and hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet broken through industry bottlenecks. True breakthroughs may come from industries that have been struggling with traditional methods for a long time, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics. AI can help these companies improve efficiency and reduce costs in complex scenarios through more efficient data processing and predictive analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productization and Ease of Use&lt;/strong&gt;
Just like Docker simplifies containerization processes to boost operational efficiency, the ease of use of AI products is equally crucial. The widespread adoption of AI isn&amp;rsquo;t just about technological proliferation; it’s also about product proliferation. Integrating AI into daily workflows, allowing users to easily utilize these tools without needing to deeply understand the technology, is a key step in AI implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecosystem Building and Standardization&lt;/strong&gt;
Any new technology’s widespread adoption relies on ecosystem building. Docker&amp;rsquo;s rapid rise was due to its openness and compatibility, enabling developers to seamlessly integrate with various cloud platforms, tools, and services. Similarly, the future of AI depends on the construction of an ecosystem.  Standardization of AI, model sharing, data openness, and technological interoperability will all influence whether AI can form widespread industry applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-the-future-of-ai-is-full-of-possibilities-but-requires-more-refined-implementation&#34;&gt;Conclusion: The Future of AI is Full of Possibilities, but Requires More Refined Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant advancements in AI technology over the past two years, it remains in the stage of “lacking killer applications” at present. Similar to containerization technology before Docker’s release, AI needs a reasonable application scenario that deeply integrates existing technologies with business requirements to truly achieve large-scale adoption and widespread use. While technological innovation is important, solutions that simplify processes and improve efficiency are more likely to drive the popularization and development of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, AI may evolve like Docker – not through disruptive technological breakthroughs, but by integrating existing technologies to create a perfect application scenario, ultimately changing the way we work and live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Golden Week and National Day holiday periods saw the stock market’s “ice and fire dichotomy”: dramatic swings between soaring gains and sharp declines.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/stock-market-rollercoaster-ahead-of-national-day/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:42:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/stock-market-rollercoaster-ahead-of-national-day/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the eve of China’s National Day in 2024, the stock market experienced a remarkable surge, attracting widespread attention. However, following the holiday, the market unexpectedly turned to a dramatic plunge. This “polarization” of the stock market – a rollercoaster ride between soaring highs and plummeting lows – not only subjected investors to a heart-pounding experience but also prompted deep reflection on policy, economics, and market fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Insert relevant news snippets and data visualizations here - this section would be populated with actual content for a blog post]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-national-day-stock-market-surge-a-policy-driven-frenzy&#34;&gt;Pre-National Day Stock Market Surge: A Policy-Driven Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the five trading days leading up to National Day, China’s stock market surged from a slump into “boiling mode.” On September 30th, the A-share market saw a full-scale rally with all indices hitting historic highs. The Shanghai Composite Index rose by 8.06%, the Shenzhen Component Index increased by 10.67%, and the Innovation Board China Advanced Index soared by 15.36%, while the STAR 50 Index achieved its largest single-day rise in history, jumping 22.84%. Market sentiment was extremely exuberant, with daily trading volumes across the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Northern Exchanges reaching RMB 2611.5 billion, a significant increase of RMB 11559 billion compared to the previous day. More than 5300 stocks on the main board rallied collectively, creating a “sea of red.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core driver behind this rally was the concentrated release of a series of unexpectedly positive policies by the government and the resulting changes in market expectations. On September 24th, the People’s Bank of China announced a cut in the reserve requirement ratio and interest rates, reducing existing mortgage loan interest rates and standardizing the minimum down payment ratios. The Politburo Standing Committee&amp;rsquo;s meeting on September 26th emphasized the need to intensify counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policy adjustments to boost capital markets and actively guide medium and long-term funds into the market. On September 30th, a series of real estate support policies were released. These measures conveyed the government’s determination to stabilize the market and promote growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-national-day-stock-market-plunge-calm-and-adjustment-after-the-frenzy&#34;&gt;Post-National Day Stock Market Plunge: Calm and Adjustment After the Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, following the National Day holiday, market sentiment plummeted dramatically. On October 8th, the A-share market opened strongly with nearly a limit-up rise, but after a significant high opening, the market experienced violent fluctuations, ultimately closing down after opening higher. From then on, the market’s center of gravity continuously shifted downwards, and as of October 16th, the Shanghai Composite Index (HSI) rose and fell by more than 15%, with a cumulative decline of over 470 points. From October 8th to 10th, core A-share indices all declined, with the Shenzhen Component Index falling by 6.21%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this plunge were multifaceted, on one hand, digesting the accumulated risks from the rapid rise in the previous period, and on the other hand, related to adjustments in market expectations regarding policy. Some investors believed that the short-term effects of policies had become apparent, but the long-term impact still needed observation. Furthermore, volatility in global markets also impacted A-shares. On October 9th, the Hang Seng Index plunged by 9.41%, and A50 futures fell by 10.4%, further exacerbating the market’s decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflection-and-outlook-on-the-market&#34;&gt;Reflection and Outlook on the Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dramatic volatility in the stock market around National Day highlighted a deep reflection among investors regarding policy, economics, and market fundamentals. On one hand, the short-term stimulus effects of policies were significant, but their long-term impact remains to be observed. On the other hand, the rapid rise and fall of the market served as a reminder for investors to maintain rationality and avoid emotional investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, whether A-shares can usher in a genuine “long bull” market depends on whether policy can effectively transmit to the real economy and ultimately drive substantive improvements in economic fundamentals. Investors should closely monitor the specific implementation of policies and changes in economic data to rationally adjust their investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp rises and falls in the stock market around National Day were a game between policy and the market, and also a test of investors’ mentality. In this “two-pronged” market environment, we saw the power of the market and the influence of policy. How the market will unfold in the future remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Spring Festival box office *Ne Zha* goes viral/breaks out</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ne-zha-breaks-through-during-spring-festival/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:40:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ne-zha-breaks-through-during-spring-festival/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation of the provided Chinese text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As Chinese people, every Spring Festival, we gather with our families for reunion dinners and watching movies has become an indispensable entertainment activity. This year’s Spring Festival box office hit, &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt;, exploded out of its niche, sparking discussions on streets and in alleys. The scale is impressive, reminiscent of the previous blockbuster, &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, carrying a strong patriotic theme that inexplicably evokes a sense of national pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article, topic: The explosive popularity of &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt; at the Spring Festival box office, the inexplicable sense of national pride, similar to older films like &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, with a patriotic theme. While there has been significant progress, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t reached this level. As gamers, many aspects seem greasy, and the combat scenes are heavily influenced by online games. There have already been people who bought movie tickets for &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt; but didn’t actually watch it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-combat-scene-lacked-texture&#34;&gt;The Combat Scene Lacked Texture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a gamer, I’m usually immersed in various online worlds. Because of this, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have high expectations for movies. However, with the huge popularity of &lt;em&gt;The Battle Between Heaven and Earth&lt;/em&gt;, everyone around me was talking about it, so I thought I’d take a look. When I entered the cinema, as soon as the scene came on screen, my heart sank. Although the visuals were noticeably improved compared to previous films, some scenes looked a bit greasy. Specifically, the combat scenes felt too heavily influenced by games; you know, like the style was too much like what I’ve seen in video games. Having played so many years of games, the visual style and certain scenes reminded me too strongly of those in games, lacking the texture that a film should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crazy-fanatics&#34;&gt;Crazy Fanatics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the movie, I went out to see what was happening online. Turns out, quite a few people said they bought tickets for &lt;em&gt;The Soul of the Demon&lt;/em&gt; purely to boost its box office revenue. This is impressive – I have to admit I’m somewhat impressed! It seems that everyone&amp;rsquo;s enthusiasm and support for this film is incredibly high, and they were willing to do something for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storyline&#34;&gt;Storyline
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s reflect on it: back when “The Battle of Wukong” came out, Wu Jing shouted “Anyone who dares to harm China will be punished, no matter how far away,” and countless people felt a surge of patriotism, thinking our Chinese military was incredibly powerful and our country immensely strong. Although “The White Dragon” doesn’t have such a direct patriotic slogan, it vividly portrays traditional Chinese culture. Characters like Nezha and Ao Bing, figures we&amp;rsquo;ve grown up hearing stories about since childhood, are brought to life with their feuds, romances, and growth journeys in the film – this is precisely the charm of Chinese culture, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take Nezha as an example. He was misunderstood and ostracized from a young age, but he refused to give up, shouting “My destiny is not determined by heaven, but by myself,” which resonates so strongly with the resilience deep within every Chinese person. No matter what difficulties we face, we don&amp;rsquo;t bow down; we change our fate through our own efforts. Ao Bing is similar, carrying the burden of his family’s mission, appearing cold on the surface but possessing a kind heart, and sacrificing himself for his friends. This friendship, this sense of responsibility – aren’t we often able to see these things in real life too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advancements-in-animated-films&#34;&gt;Advancements in Animated Films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;The Fire on the Mountain&lt;/em&gt; (Nezha) had some imperfections, it effectively combined traditional Chinese culture with modern film technology, allowing us to see significant progress in Chinese animated films. Just as &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated China’s breakthrough in the action film genre. This kind of advancement makes us feel that Chinese cinema can rise to prominence on the international stage and allows foreigners to witness the brilliance of Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chinese people, no matter where we go, we carry our nation and culture within us. Films like &lt;em&gt;Nezha&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt; are like keys that unlock the deep-seated sense of national pride within us. They allow us to feel the strength of our country and the charm of our culture amidst laughter and joy, while also inspiring us to work hard in our respective roles to contribute to the prosperity and flourishing of our nation. That’s probably why these films went viral and were able to evoke a sense of national pride within us. In the future, we hope for more films like this to appear, allowing this feeling of national pride to remain full and abundant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>“Making an investment and making money isn’t urgent, and even if you’re anxious, it won’t help.”</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:30:24 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on years of stock trading experiences, although I didn’t make a fortune, I also didn&amp;rsquo;t lose too much. The biggest issue was an unreasonable allocation of funds and an unstable mindset. Currently, my primary source of income is work, earning a fixed salary each day through part-time jobs. My ability to withstand financial fluctuations remains at the level of bonds and bank deposits. However, people are inherently greedy; if you buy too little, even when prices rise, you won’t make money; if you buy too much, you will lose money. At this point, maintaining a stable mindset is particularly important, as it can help us keep our wealth afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article: Addressing the mental issues in stock trading finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-loss-cases&#34;&gt;Historical Loss Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the initial entry into the market, I encountered small-cap and near-new stocks. Later, I focused on blue-chip large-cap stocks: Industrial Bank, China Unicom, Hong Kong Electronics, ZTESC, and various large-stock index funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Expected annualized returns were touted as matching a bank’s three-year fixed deposit,” but in reality, there was greed wanting more, leading to hasty increases from the beginning, followed by depletion of cash flow. Purchases of insurance, real estate, and weddings represented significant outflows of capital, resulting in insufficient liquidity overall, causing problems later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in blue chips is like aligning with “old money”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Evergrande faced issues, bank stocks plummeted dramatically, successfully capitalizing on the washout phase. This reflects a lack of understanding regarding the economic impact of real estate, which accounts for a significant portion of China’s economy, and it was impossible to “force a landing.” The subsequent sustained decline in the stock market saw blue-chip stocks like Industrial Bank continue to rise for about two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the initial stages of trade wars, ZTESC suffered severe damage, with its stock price also falling sharply. It has since gradually recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Electronics, a long-standing company, experienced a significant drop in its stock price after Ant Financial’s departure, but this stock was manipulated by a major shareholder, allowing it to surge upwards several times per year. With reasonable position sizing, losses could be minimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;greed-the-monster-that-devours-reason&#34;&gt;Greed: The &amp;ldquo;Monster&amp;rdquo; That Devours Reason
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greed is the most common problem in a stock trading mindset. When stock prices rise steadily, and investors’ account profits continuously increase, greed quietly takes root. Many people still fantasize about continued price increases even when stocks are already at high levels, craving more gains and unwilling to cut their profits. They are blinded by greed, forgetting the laws of the market and the existence of risk. For example, during the hype of certain hot-themed stocks, some investors see prices double or even multiply within a short period, falling into it, constantly adding to their positions, hoping to be the last winner. However, the market will not always go crazy; when the bubble bursts and stock prices plummet sharply, these investors driven by greed often suffer heavy losses. Greed causes them to lose their ability to rationally analyze and make decisions, turning them into &amp;ldquo;gamblers&amp;rdquo; in the stock market rather than wise investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-the-chain-that-restricts&#34;&gt;Fear: The “Chain” That Restricts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is the counterpart to greed. It possesses a powerful destructive force in the stock market as well. When market conditions suddenly plummet and stock prices fall sharply, investors are prone to panic. This fear erodes their confidence in the market, even when the fundamentals of their holdings are sound, leading them to hastily sell off their shares out of a fear of further losses. For example, during periods of global financial crises, even high-quality blue-chip stocks saw significant declines alongside the broader market. Some investors were consumed by fear and failed to recognize the long-term value of these companies, selling their stock at extremely low prices and missing out on substantial returns from subsequent market rebounds and company performance growth. Fear not only causes short-term losses for investors but can also create a lasting psychological shadow over the stock market, making them hesitant to re-enter, thus losing out on investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blind-following-losing-direction-in-the-fog&#34;&gt;Blind Following: Losing Direction in the &amp;ldquo;Fog&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stock trading and wealth management, blindly following trends is another psychological pitfall that investors easily fall into. In an era of information explosion, various investment suggestions, market rumors, and hot topics are rampant. Many investors lack independent thinking and judgment abilities, blindly following others&amp;rsquo; operations. When they see their peers making money by buying a particular stock, they immediately follow suit without further thought; when they hear so-called &amp;ldquo;insider news,&amp;rdquo; they readily share it. This blind following behavior ignores the research and analysis of the underlying stocks, causing investors to be like lost ships in the fog, losing their own direction. For example, some concept stocks can indeed generate short-term profits for followers during market hype. However, as the hype fades and stock prices plummet, those who are unaware and blindly follow will become &amp;ldquo;cash absorbers.&amp;rdquo; They didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that everyone’s risk tolerance, investment goals, and investment horizons are different, and a strategy suitable for others may not be suitable for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overconfidence-the-hidden-shallow&#34;&gt;Overconfidence: The Hidden &amp;ldquo;Shallow&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence is also a significant issue in the investment and financial mindset. Some investors, after achieving several successful investments, begin to inflate their egos, believing they have mastered market patterns and can accurately predict stock movements. They ignore the complexity and uncertainty of the market, engage in excessive trading, blindly expand their investment scale, and even use high leverage for speculation. However, the market is ever-changing, and overconfident investors often suffer severe setbacks in a single unexpected market fluctuation. For example, some investors with limited experience who achieved an initial victory believe they possess professional investment capabilities and begin to frequently buy and sell stocks, constantly increasing their investment amount. When systemic risks or sudden negative news about individual stocks emerge, they fail to cut their losses promptly due to overconfidence, leading to a significant reduction in their principal capital. Overconfidence is like hidden reefs beneath the surface of the water – seemingly peaceful and harmless, but can unexpectedly cause an investor&amp;rsquo;s wealth vessel to run aground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-for-stable-financial-planning&#34;&gt;How to Adjust Your Mindset for Stable Financial Planning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish the Right Investment Philosophy:&lt;/strong&gt; Investors should clearly understand that stock investing and wealth management are about achieving long-term, stable asset appreciation, not overnight riches. By learning investment knowledge, understanding market patterns, adopting value investing and long-term investment philosophies, and avoiding being swayed by short-term gains and market sentiment, you can make more informed decisions. For example, thoroughly research a company’s fundamentals, paying attention to its profitability, industry position, management team, and other relevant factors, choosing stocks with long-term investment potential rather than blindly chasing short-term trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a Reasonable Investment Plan:&lt;/strong&gt; Based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals, create a scientific and reasonable investment plan. Clearly define key elements such as investment amount, investment period, expected returns, and stop-loss points, and strictly execute the plan. This prevents impulsive decisions driven by emotional fluctuations during investing. For example, set the investment proportion of each stock to no more than a certain percentage of your total assets, and promptly take profits when the price rises to your expected return, and decisively cut losses when it falls to your stop-loss point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control Your Emotions and Stay Calm:&lt;/strong&gt; When facing market volatility, learn to control your emotions and maintain calmness and rationality. You can relieve investment pressure through methods such as diverting attention, engaging in physical exercise, or communicating with others, avoiding negative impacts of emotions on investment decisions. When the market experiences significant fluctuations, first calmly analyze the reasons, combine your investment strategy and stock fundamentals, and make rational judgments instead of blindly following trends or panic selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue Learning and Reflecting:&lt;/strong&gt; The stock market is constantly evolving, so investors need to continuously learn new investment knowledge and skills, pay attention to macroeconomic conditions, industry dynamics, and company information, and constantly improve their investment level. At the same time, regularly reflect on your investment behavior, summarize experiences and lessons, identify problems in your mindset and decision-making, and promptly adjust and improve them. For example, after each investment, review the entire investment process, analyze the reasons for success and failure, and think about how to avoid similar mistakes in future investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth management is a long and challenging journey, and mindset plays a crucial role. Only by maintaining rational, calm, humble, and independent thinking can you steadily advance in the stock market’s waves and achieve wealth preservation and appreciation. Investors should consider cultivating their mindset as an essential course in the investment process, using a good mindset to steer the ship of wealth, and moving forward steadily on the path of stock investing and wealth management.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Echoes of bygone years, offering unconventional fantasies and emotional solace.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 22:12:57 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the earliest web novel readers entered middle age, the type of “revenge” stories catered to them also evolved. The protagonists often appeared as fathers, mentors, or elderly figures, meeting the different needs and demands of middle-aged readers for life and emotion. These works no longer solely focused on upgrades and reversals; instead, they emphasized emotional resonance and life reflections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;target-audience-shifting-reader-base-amidst-the-passage-of-time&#34;&gt;Target Audience: Shifting Reader Base Amidst the Passage of Time
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former web novel readers have largely transitioned into middle age. They’ve experienced the trials and tribulations of life, leading to shifts in their mindset and values. The passionate, adventurous elements they once chased are no longer the sole focus for them. Instead, they seek emotional resonance with their current lives and a sense of nostalgia for past years, as well as aspirations for the future. Middle-aged爽文 (shuangwen - a popular genre) emerged specifically to meet this psychological need. It utilizes plot settings that closely align with the lives and attitudes of middle-aged readers, attracting this particular demographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;role-shift-from-young-hero-to-middle-aged-guardian&#34;&gt;Role Shift: From Young Hero to Middle-Aged Guardian
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Students Are All Villains:&lt;/strong&gt; The protagonist, Lu Zhou, after becoming a master, faces a group of disciples with diverse personalities and formidable strength. They teeter between good and evil, and Lu Zhou needs to guide them towards the right path. This novel showcases the challenges and confusion faced by middle-aged individuals when educating the next generation through interactions with their disciples. Furthermore, the growth and transformation of the disciples offer hope and a glimpse into the future, mirroring expectations for one’s children or younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emotional-resonance-life-reflections-and-family-responsibilities&#34;&gt;Emotional Resonance: Life Reflections and Family Responsibilities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sixty-Year-Old Birthday System:&lt;/strong&gt; The protagonist gained a system upon turning sixty, embarking on a new life journey. This setting allows middle-aged readers to feel a sense of “it’s never too late” hope and inspiration. Even having reached old age, the protagonist can still realize their value and dreams through the system. This plot encourages readers to reflect on missed opportunities and unfulfilled dreams in their own lives, while also conveying an optimistic attitude, encouraging them not to give up pursuing their goals at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-design-aligning-with-the-rhythm-and-humor-of-middle-age-life&#34;&gt;Plot Design: Aligning with the Rhythm and Humor of Middle Age Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot designs for middle-aged “revenge” novels often place a greater emphasis on the details of life and the nuanced expression of emotions. Unlike young adult revenge novels that prioritize rapid upgrades and adventures, they focus more on relationships between characters and emotional entanglements. For example, in &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Master Craftsman&lt;/em&gt;, the protagonist’s friendship with his apprentice, their brotherhood with fellow disciples, etc., are all depicted in detail. This plot design allows middle-aged readers to feel a sense of warmth and familiarity, as if they were seeing their own family relationships, friendships, and love lives.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spring Festival Blockbuster Movie Ticket Price Mystery: The Difference Between Online and Offline Prices</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-movie-ticket-price-mystery/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:02:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-movie-ticket-price-mystery/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the Spring Festival, a family of seven or eight people wanted to go see a movie. They originally planned to buy tickets on Taopiaopiao and Maoyan. When they looked at the price, it was 60 yuan. Luckily, they had a cinema recharge card that required them to purchase tickets at the cinema’s front desk. They thought about asking the front desk if there were any discounts, but unexpectedly, the same showtime cost only 35 yuan when purchased at the front desk. The price difference was quite surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hidden-add-on-of-platform-service-fees&#34;&gt;The “Hidden Add-on” of Platform Service Fees
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While online ticketing platforms are convenient, platform service fees cannot be ignored. They provide users with a seamless booking experience, such as precise seat selection and the ability to view purchase history at any time – all of which require investment in maintenance. These costs are then passed on to consumers through increased ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cinema-differentiation-operation-strategies&#34;&gt;Cinema Differentiation Operation Strategies
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the explosive demand for movie-watching during the Spring Festival, cinemas adopted differentiated pricing strategies to maximize revenue. Online platforms have a large volume of traffic, and many people are accustomed to purchasing tickets online in advance; therefore, cinema ticket prices were set higher on these platforms. Conversely, those buying tickets directly at the box office – walk-in customers – received lower prices to attract this segment of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-price-logic-behind-revenue-sharing&#34;&gt;The Price Logic Behind Revenue Sharing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue sharing models between online platforms and cinemas impact ticket prices. For an online platform to take a slice of the box office revenue – in order to maintain profitability – they will typically raise ticket prices. Meanwhile, cinema box offices have no intermediary costs, leading to lower prices and more affordable tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consumer-ticket-buying-tips&#34;&gt;Consumer Ticket Buying Tips
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t just look at online platforms when buying tickets. Call the cinema&amp;rsquo;s front desk to inquire about prices, or go directly to the front desk and ask – you might find a surprise. If you frequently watch movies, get an auditorium membership card to enjoy member discounts and save money.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Analysis of Political Elements in 2025 Spring Festival Film Releases</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-films-spring-festival-2025/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:49:42 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-films-spring-festival-2025/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I went to the Spring Festival movie release to join in the crowds, and this time I watched two films that felt quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the new changes in the 2025 Spring Festival movie releases, focusing on &lt;em&gt;Dwelling in the Fuchun Pavilion&lt;/em&gt; (Tangrenjie Tanjian 1900) and &lt;em&gt;Nezha: The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Child&lt;/em&gt;. The former utilizes the backdrop of San Francisco’s Chinatown in 1900 to depict the discrimination and oppression faced by Chinese people, reflecting social and political conditions. As an animated film, the latter employs rich metaphorical elements to subtly critique the current international political landscape – such as the Jade Palace resembling the Pentagon mirroring the American political system, the dollar symbol on the Heavenly Mandate Throne symbolizing U.S. dollar hegemony, the jade amulet similar to American green cards representing status levels, and the Soul-Devouring Elixir resembling biological weapons reflecting malicious actions. Both films offer a new viewing experience and prompt reflection on the relationship between cinematic art and political expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovation-in-the-style-of-chinese-new-year-film-releases&#34;&gt;Innovation in the Style of Chinese New Year Film Releases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, films released during the Spring Festival often featured lighthearted entertainment and family-friendly themes, aiming to allow audiences to relax and unwind during the holiday season, rarely addressing sensitive political topics. However, in 2025, the Spring Festival release broke with convention; &lt;em&gt;The Mystery Down South 1900&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nezha: Part One&lt;/em&gt; incorporated rich political elements, sparking widespread discussion among viewers and bringing a new atmosphere to the Spring Festival film slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shanghai-noon-1900-a-vivid-depiction-of-political-times&#34;&gt;“Shanghai Noon 1900”: A Vivid Depiction of Political Times
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shanghai Noon 1900” is set in San Francisco’s Chinatown in 1900, when Chinese immigrants overseas faced severe racial discrimination and oppression. The protagonists not only have to solve the mystery of the case but also confront discrimination and unfair treatment from all sides of society. The film&amp;rsquo;s portrayal of racism and power struggles accurately reflects the social political environment of that time, allowing us to see the difficult struggle of Chinese immigrants for survival and dignity, and the underlying political issues worth deep consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This historical background inevitably reminds one of the current predicament faced by overseas Chinese in the business sector, such as the TikTok and Zhou Jiayu incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 6, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected TikTok’s request, ruling that the legally mandated sale law passed by Congress under national security grounds had withstood constitutional scrutiny. TikTok CEO Zhou Jiayu wrote in a memo to employees that the next step would be “seeking an injunction and awaiting review by the U.S. Supreme Court.” The source of this event is the U.S.’s “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversarial Control of Applications” law, which requires ByteDance to divest its TikTok business within 270 days after the law’s passage, with a final deadline of January 19, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During various hearings, Zhou Jiayu was subjected to numerous difficulties. On January 31, 2024, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on “The Big Tech Companies and the Online Child Sexual Abuse Crisis,” with anti-China lawmaker Tom Cotton confronting Zhou Jiayu, repeatedly posing eight questions about his nationality, including asking him what country he was from, whether he had applied for Chinese or American citizenship, even sparing his wife and children’s nationalities. Despite the hearing&amp;rsquo;s theme being “online child sexual abuse,” the lawmakers shifted the topic to TikTok being owned by Chinese company ByteDance, forcing Zhou Jiayu to answer irrelevant questions. Just as in “Shanghai Noon 1900,” Chinese people overseas faced unwarranted discrimination, Zhou Jiayu also suffered from unfair treatment and questioning due to the background of TikTok, which is owned by ByteDance. This series of events reflects how, across different eras, overseas Chinese face numerous obstacles when pursuing their own development and safeguarding their rights – whether it’s racial discrimination a century ago or political manipulation in business today, all deserve our deep reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-deer-and-the-phoenix-political-metaphors-hidden-behind-mythology--an-analysis&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Deer and the Phoenix&amp;rdquo;: Political Metaphors Hidden Behind Mythology – An Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite appearing as a typical animated film, “The Deer and the Phoenix” is replete with political metaphors through its numerous settings and plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping of Power Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; The Yuhuang Palace is molded into the center of supreme power in the celestial realm, with architectural styles resembling the Pentagon, primarily using white tones to symbolize Western hegemony disguised under the banner of “universal values.” The “Monster Hunting Squad” led by Wuliangxian, with its subordinates Lu Ban and He Feizi, are believed to correspond to the US alliance system, including Japan and South Korea. The Yuhuang Palace’s “online meeting” scene, with twelve golden immortals discussing the “Battle of Sovereigns,” is similar to NATO meetings led by the United States, suppressing other countries under the guise of “maintaining order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hints of Economic Hegemony:&lt;/strong&gt; The Taiyuan Ding used for alchemy in the Yuhuang Palace has a dollar sign at its entrance, symbolizing America’s use of economic hegemony to “refine” and exploit resources from other nations. Wuliangxian’s act of refining dragons into the Ding with the justification of “upholding heaven and earth” is like certain countries using “international rules” to pursue their interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metaphors of Identity and Hierarchy:&lt;/strong&gt; The celestial identity amulet granted to Nezha, with its color and pattern design resembling a US green card, symbolizes the celestial realm’s rejection and hierarchical division of “foreign races,” reflecting real-world differences in identities and unequal treatment between different countries and groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Allusions to Malicious Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; Wuliangxian forcing Nezha to take the Dan of Soul Annihilation, which resembles a bioweapon, darkly alludes to certain countries using the guise of “saving the world” to carry out destructive and devastating actions against other nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbolism of Resources and Development:&lt;/strong&gt; The Seven Colored Lotus is crucial for reshaping Nezha and敖 Peng’s bodies, symbolizing key energy and technological lifelines monopolized by major powers. Its “jade nectar and elixir” must be obtained through the Yuhuang Palace&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;celestial examination,&amp;rdquo; mirroring developing countries’ dependence on core resources and being subjected to “rule-based plunder” under a hegemonic system. The Lotus’ temporary failure and restoration conditions reflect the plight of small nations in energy crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deep-reflections-on-cinematic-art-and-political-expression&#34;&gt;Deep Reflections on Cinematic Art and Political Expression
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These films, amidst the nationwide viewing craze during the Spring Festival, incorporated political elements, offering audiences a new cinematic experience – one that moved beyond simple entertainment and served as a mirror reflecting political issues within history and reality. This has prompted us to delve into the relationship between cinematic art and political expression. Will directors in future film creations increasingly convey their perspectives on social and political matters through cinema? As a powerful cultural transmission medium, can film simultaneously engage in artistic expression while also taking greater notice and consideration of societal realities? These questions are worth exploring as we appreciate films, and we look forward to the film industry bringing more exciting integration of art and real-world expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-egg&#34;&gt;Easter Egg
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boabab large model, wasn&amp;rsquo;t performing very well today, it froze several times, the article stopped halfway and couldn’t continue, so I had to restart the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The two major political parties in the United States – the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:40:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Party and the Republican Party exhibit significant differences in political ideology, policy proposals, and social values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;political-ideologies-and-policy-positions&#34;&gt;Political Ideologies and Policy Positions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democratic Party:&lt;/strong&gt; Leans towards liberal/progressive, advocating for the government to play an active role in economic and social affairs, supporting social welfare, environmental protection, and multiculturalism. In tax policy, the Democratic Party supports tax cuts for low- and middle-income individuals while raising taxes on high earners and corporations. On social issues, the Democratic Party supports abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and advocates for strict gun control. In foreign policy, the Democratic Party emphasizes multilateralism and diplomatic means, preferring to address global problems through international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Republican Party:&lt;/strong&gt; Leans towards conservative, advocating for limited government intervention, emphasizing individual liberty and a free market economy. In tax policy, the Republican Party supports tax cuts, believing they should apply to everyone regardless of income. On social issues, the Republican Party opposes abortion and same-sex marriage, supports the right to bear arms. In foreign policy, the Republican Party tends to take a strong stance, supporting the use of military force to protect national interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-significance-of-trumps-second-term&#34;&gt;The Significance of Trump’s Second Term
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump was re-elected as President of the United States in 2024, marking a continued dominance for the Republican Party within American politics. Trump&amp;rsquo;s policy agenda included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump advocated for stimulating economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation, particularly supporting the development of traditional manufacturing and energy industries. He also favored protectionist trade policies, renegotiating or withdrawing from existing trade agreements to protect America’s economic interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immigration Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump planned to strengthen border security, restrict illegal immigration, and implement stricter scrutiny and limitations on legal immigrants. He supported limiting refugee and asylum applications to maintain national security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump tended towards unilateralism, emphasizing “America First,” reducing reliance on international organizations, reevaluating relationships with allies, and employing more assertive diplomatic measures when necessary. He also planned to expand fossil fuel production and use, relaxing restrictions on environmental protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s second term could lead to significant adjustments in U.S. domestic policy and have profound impacts on global politics and economics. His policies are likely to garner attention and responses from the international community, particularly in areas such as trade, environment, and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DeepSeek suddenly went viral before the Spring Festival, NVIDIA stock plummeted: The underlying institutional operations and the chain of thought for large models.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-explodes-before-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-plummets-behind-the-scenes-and-large-language-model-reasoning/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:36:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-explodes-before-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-plummets-behind-the-scenes-and-large-language-model-reasoning/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Spring Festival, DeepSeek had become a hot topic, attracting widespread attention on social media in just a few days. This sudden surge in popularity was surprising and triggered a chain reaction in the market. Meanwhile, NVIDIA’s stock price plummeted, raising concerns among many investors, with some institutions conducting large-scale short selling during this period, seemingly pointing to a “carefully orchestrated” situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deepseeks-sudden-surge-in-popularity-rapidly-becoming-a-focus&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s Sudden Surge in Popularity: Rapidly Becoming a Focus&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is an AI-powered tool focused on optimizing deep learning models, particularly in the application of natural language processing (NLP) and image generation. In the days leading up to Chinese New Year, this project suddenly attracted significant attention from investors and tech professionals alike. The performance of its team and the demonstrated technical results sparked strong interest among many. Discussions about DeepSeek dominated virtually every topic within the developer community and on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, DeepSeek’s sudden surge in popularity was not accidental. After analysis, many began to suspect that certain entities were involved behind it. Notably, after its rise to prominence, NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s stock experienced a significant decline, suggesting that some factors were driving this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nvidia-stock-plummets-the-hand-behind-the-short-selling-operation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia Stock Plummets: The Hand Behind the Short Selling Operation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), has long been a key hardware provider for many large models and AI computations. With the rapid development of the AI market, Nvidia’s stock has performed strongly over the long term and even become a favorite among many investors. However, with the explosive popularity of DeepSeek and the market&amp;rsquo;s intense focus on its technology, Nvidia’s stock experienced a dramatic plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason behind this phenomenon may involve institutional investor short selling strategies. Over the past few years, as AI technology has spread, Nvidia’s stock price has been significantly inflated, leading many investors to believe that it was at risk of excessive speculation. Especially after a technology like DeepSeek went viral, some institutions may have profited by shorting Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock. By accurately grasping market timing and predicting the influence of DeepSeek, these institutions successfully made a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;large-model-chain-of-thought-interaction-from-results-to-process&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Model Chain-of-Thought Interaction: From “Results” to “Process”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In traditional AI applications, many practitioners and investors have focused more on the &amp;ldquo;results&amp;rdquo; of AI models – such as generated images and text – direct outputs. However, in discussions related to DeepSeek, an increasing number of people are beginning to realize that the underlying chain-of-thought hidden behind large models is the core content worth paying more attention to. Previously, we could only see the results output by the model, but now we need to understand its logic, algorithms, and how to optimize the model&amp;rsquo;s performance by adjusting these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in thinking is actually a deep reflection on AI research and application. From simple black-box operations to truly understanding the internal workings of models, many technical personnel and investors have begun to re-examine the future development direction of artificial intelligence. The popularity of DeepSeek perfectly demonstrates this breakthrough application of the chain-of-thought, it encourages people to focus not only on the final output results but also on the entire model construction and optimization process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sudden surge in popularity of DeepSeek, NVIDIA’s stock plummet, and the subsequent short-selling activities by institutions – it all seems like a meticulously designed scheme. Through an in-depth understanding of large model chain-of-thought reasoning, we can see that the application of AI technology is not merely superficial layering of phenomena, but also deep digging and optimization of the model’s internal logic. As the technology progresses, we may see more innovative tools like DeepSeek in the future, driving AI research and applications to a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon not only shows us the immense potential of AI technology, but also prompts us to start thinking about the commercial games and capital operations behind the technology. The future market trend will continue to be the focus of the battle between technology and capital.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The End of the Age of Wild Capitalism: The Era of League of Legends Esports Concludes</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The esports industry has experienced rapid development over the past decade and a half, becoming an increasingly significant cultural phenomenon worldwide. Particularly MOBA games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; (LoL), which is often abbreviated as LOL, not only provide players with the joy of competition but also inject powerful momentum into capital, driving the flourishing development of various esports platforms and events. However, all of this has entered a phase of gradual decline with the influx of capital and the rise of the entertainment industry. The rise and fall of PandyTV, the competition between DouYu and Huya, marks the end of the “wild capitalism era,” and the favorable conditions – time, place, people, and heaven – for esports seem to be starting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-injection&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Injection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1 The Early Days of Electronic Sports: From Grassroots to Professionalization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early esports industry started relatively grassroots, especially in China. Many players participated in competitive games like &lt;em&gt;StarCraft&lt;/em&gt; and Dota, driven by their passion for the games. However, the true rise of esports began with the release and promotion of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Following the official entry of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; into the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche community to part of mainstream culture. Notably starting in 2013, the LPL (China Professional League) was established, and &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; became the cornerstone of China’s esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.2 Capital Frenzy Influx: The Rise of PandaTV and Esports Live Streaming Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 marked a watershed moment for the Chinese esports industry. The influx of capital transformed esports from a purely competitive event into a much larger ecosystem. PandaTV, one of the representatives, became a product of excessive capital. Invested by one of its founders, Wang Sicong, PandaTV quickly rose to prominence with its innovative content and massive investment, attracting a large number of viewers and users. However, this was also a typical example of capital “barbaric” inflow – the relentless pursuit of markets often lacks patience and long-term vision. Although PandaTV’s short-term investments achieved certain results due to management issues and excessive reliance on high fever caused by capital, it ultimately declared bankruptcy in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.3 Live Streaming Platform Competition: The “Capital War” Between DouYu and Huya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demise of PandaTV did not lead to the decline of the esports live streaming industry; instead, it propelled the rise of platforms like Douyu and Huya. Douyu and Huya became leading players in the esports industry, and their competition intensified. Early on, Douyu established itself as a benchmark for esports live streaming through the broadcasting of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; professional competitions and the signing of top streamers. Huya, meanwhile, gradually narrowed the gap with Douyu by increasing its investment in esports events and diversifying its platform layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, capital played a huge role again. In 2018, Douyu successfully went public, and Huya also completed its IPO the same year. The rapid flow of capital led to industry consolidation and intensified competition between platforms in terms of streamers and copyrights, forming a “capital war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-fusion-of-mass-entertainment-and-esports&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Fusion of Mass Entertainment and Esports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1 The Trend Towards Mass Entertainment: Capital Flows into Diversified Entertainment Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As capital has heavily invested in the esports industry, esports platform content is gradually becoming mass-entertained. Esports anchors are no longer limited to match commentary and event live streaming; they have begun to expand into singing, dancing, interactive live streams, and other entertainment forms. The content on platforms is becoming more diverse, gradually forming an ecosystem centered around esports but also incorporating various entertainment elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this mass entertainment trend has also brought problems – the original focus of esports culture has been marginalized, replaced by a trend of entertainment above all else. This trend has caused some fans who originally loved esports culture to feel alienated, and capital has begun to pay more attention to other entertainment fields. The excessive influx of capital and profit-seeking behavior have gradually blurred the essence of the esports industry, and the original value concept centered around competition has been weakened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2 The Rise of Mass Entertainment Industry: Capital Withdrawal and Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and the entertainment industry have risen, capital has gradually shifted funds from esports to a wider range of entertainment content. In this process, giants such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance no longer rely solely on esports projects as sources of revenue, but are increasing their investments in areas such as film, music, and short videos.  In particular, the rise of ByteDance, through the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin (TikTok), has overshadowed the limelight of esports with other entertainment content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-league-of-legends-yellow-not-following-yellow-the-decline-of-the-eras-advantage&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: League of Legends’ “Yellow Not Following Yellow”: The Decline of the Era’s Advantage
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has almost become synonymous with China&amp;rsquo;s esports industry, achieving countless professional players, teams, and events, and also spawning a massive esports ecosystem. However, after more than ten years, as a leading project in Chinese esports, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; has entered a phase of “Yellow Not Following Yellow” – a period of decline. Particularly in recent years, the influence of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; is gradually waning, even exhibiting obvious signs of recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1 The “Fracture” in Player Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most noticeable change is the fragmentation of player groups. Initially, esports’ rapid development relied on the support of a large number of young players, many of whom became professional players or spectators thanks to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. That generation of &amp;ldquo;internet addiction&amp;rdquo; teenagers almost grew up under the “era’s advantage,” immersed in the competitive charm of LOL and thus driving the rapid expansion of the entire industry. However, as time went on, these players gradually matured, entered society, and began to shift towards other life and career paths. At the same time, a new generation of young players are not as enthusiastic about &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; as in its heyday, and the esports audience has exhibited a clear age bias and decline in interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2 The “Weakness” in Game Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, after multiple updates and revisions, still maintains a certain competitive charm, but the game’s own innovation in content appears somewhat lacking. Each year&amp;rsquo;s version updates, hero balance adjustments, and new gameplay introductions seem unable to fundamentally address players’ demand for freshness. Meanwhile, the MOBA market has become saturated, and other types of games (such as &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Game For Peace&lt;/em&gt;) have rapidly risen, diverting a large number of players who originally belonged to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. This competitive situation has left &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; unable to escape the role of “follower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-where-does-the-esports-industry-go-from-here&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Where Does the Esports Industry Go From Here?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The esports industry is like a skyscraper that sprung up seemingly overnight, with excessive capital roaming the internet sector, searching for the next big trend – and esports has become one of their targets. Leveraging China’s demographic dividend, the industry achieved tremendous success in a short period, but this success wasn&amp;rsquo;t built on a solid foundation. Excessive capital influx, talent shortages, and weak game content are all hindering the healthy development of the esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to university, I didn’t play many games; Alliance essentially accompanied my growth alongside generations. I watched countless World Finals, and as an outsider, comparing ourselves to Korean and Chinese players, especially Faker, domestic players always felt hesitant during major tournaments. I also know that athletes face immense psychological pressure, but this hasn&amp;rsquo;t been prioritized by teams. Over a decade of development, these mental health issues should be taken seriously, yet they weren’t. Domestic gameplay still relies on the innate talent of the players themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Games to Home: Why We Gradually Distance Ourselves from the Virtual World as We Grow Up</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-leave-virtual-worlds-as-we-grow-up/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:11:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-leave-virtual-worlds-as-we-grow-up/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to when you feel the most joy playing games, as a child, sneaking onto your parents’ TV to play Tank War, Super Mario, or Space Invaders, or secretly using your home computer with your cousin to play Age of Empires, or even in college, playing Devil May Cry and League of Legends with roommates – those were the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, without the worries of life, when you played, you truly immersed yourself completely. That sense of immersion is something you can never find again as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the changes in society and progress, we gradually realized that the virtual world where we once thrived was becoming further away from our lives. The disconnection of game social links, accompanied by players falling out of line, isn&amp;rsquo;t just due to technological advancements and the replacement of games themselves; it’s also because our focus has shifted. As we get older, we start busy with marriage and having children, and our main life path has gradually shifted from personal entertainment to family responsibilities. Today, let’s talk about the underlying reasons behind this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disappearance-of-gaming-socialization-a-tug-of-war-between-virtual-and-real-worlds&#34;&gt;The Disappearance of Gaming Socialization: A Tug-of-War Between Virtual and Real Worlds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people’s youth, games were more than just entertainment; they were a social way of life. A popular multiplayer online game didn&amp;rsquo;t just offer in-game challenges and competition – it connected players from all over the world, building virtual social circles. Back then, playing dungeons together with friends, forming teams for PvP combat, was part of everyday life. Those late-night voice chats and sharing of daily experiences became a cherished memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as time went on, more and more players realized that this virtual socialization experience didn’t have lasting appeal. With the constant evolution of games and the diversification of social platforms, players gradually found more interactive ways outside of gaming. Friends made in games eventually faded from view, and many formerly active social connections within games quietly fractured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gaming-and-responsibility-the-shift-in-focus-of-adult-life&#34;&gt;Gaming and Responsibility: The Shift in Focus of Adult Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you enter adulthood, responsibilities gradually increase. Many young people once invested a significant amount of time in games, but as their careers begin or they start living with partners and forming families, these activities that previously seemed indispensable entertainment are increasingly squeezed by the demands of real-life responsibility. Marriage, having children, even caring for parents, these major life responsibilities force individuals to make choices about their energy and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming becomes a thing of the past, replaced by the priority of family life. Many young people who once “fought” in games gradually discover that real life is the most important subject. Especially after having children, the focus of life completely shifts towards family, and gaming is gradually pushed to the periphery of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-games-to-home-how-changes-in-life-are-affecting-our-entertainment&#34;&gt;From Games to Home: How Changes in Life Are Affecting Our Entertainment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within our life experiences, the family is one of the most important components. And once you enter family life, the division of time and energy becomes more specific and limited. Many young parents find that they no longer have enough time to focus on games they used to love, as they dedicate themselves to caring for children and spending time with their spouses. Sometimes, they even stop chasing updates and new features in games. Gradually, social platforms and offline interactions with friends and family have become the preferred way for many people to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean we completely abandon entertainment activities; it simply means we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen ways that better suit our current life stage. Many friends who were originally accustomed to maintaining contact through games may choose other methods of connection due to different life trajectories, such as family gatherings, dinners, short trips, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-farewell-of-virtual-worlds-how-do-we-view-this-transition&#34;&gt;The Farewell of Virtual Worlds: How Do We View This Transition?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many who once immersed themselves in games, saying goodbye to gaming social wasn’t easy. After all, the virtual world that had once brought us joy and accomplishment had long become a part of our memories. However, farewell doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean complete severance; it’s about making different choices as life changes, balancing our roles in real-life. As we grow older from youthful adolescence into responsible adults, games may still hold value, but they can no longer be the main rhythm of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this transition also reflects a facet of human adaptability – our ability to adjust our focus and lifestyle as different stages of life unfold. When responsibility and family become central to our lives, gaming social is no longer a priority, but rather an occasional leisure activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-of-gaming-perhaps-well-see-another-wave-of-sense-of-belonging&#34;&gt;The Future of Gaming: Perhaps We’ll See Another Wave of “Sense of Belonging”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, as society and technology continue to develop, the forms and content of games are constantly evolving. For example, modern multiplayer online games have begun to evolve towards more relaxed and flexible ways, with some designs even focusing on family interaction and parent-child relationships. In the future, we may see more game formats that can better integrate into family life and provide players with healthier, more balanced social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as many people reminisce about “games from their childhood” with nostalgia and passion, perhaps in the future we will also pick up those games again at an unexpected moment, with new understanding and insight, and step back into that virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;living-in-change-yet-still-loving&#34;&gt;Living in Change, Yet Still Loving
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s gaming or family life, the changes in our lives always accompany us as we grow. In this process, we gradually realize that, although the virtual world brings us endless joy and excitement, ultimately, we will return to reality, back to the warmest place of all – family. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to regret leaving games behind because every stage of life has its own unique meaning. And these changes are what make us a more complete person.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Town Brahmin: The “Big Man” of Small Places</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:02:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, the popular &amp;ldquo;Da Bing&amp;rdquo; (Big Ice) on Douyin (TikTok) has been frequently seen with short video accounts extracted from her live streams. A listener who joined a live call asked: “Da Bing, I want to sell my house in Xi’an and return home to settle down.” Da Bing responded: “At your age, you&amp;rsquo;re in your early thirties; you can&amp;rsquo;t settle down. Your parents are on the path of aging, your children haven’t started a family or established themselves, and if you return home, you’ll still need to deal with the &lt;em&gt;poren&lt;/em&gt;.”
Let’s set aside whether the viewpoint is right or wrong, what does the term “poren” mean?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;township-brahmins-the-big-shots-of-small-places&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Township Brahmins: The “Big Shots” of Small Places&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many small county towns, people often talk about so-called &amp;ldquo;township brahmins&amp;rdquo;—the existence of these individuals seems to be a symbol of local society. They are not necessarily genuine religious figures and do not possess “high-level” titles; rather, they are seemingly ordinary but nonetheless influential people. They represent “power, status, and influence” within that county town, symbolizing a particular class or stratum in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-xiancheng-babao&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an “Xiancheng Babao?”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand that “Babao” originally referred to the highest caste in Indian society, representing wisdom, authority, and spiritual supremacy. In China’s county towns, the term “Xiancheng Babao” doesn&amp;rsquo;t have such a complex religious background; it’s more of a metaphor for a social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, an “Xiancheng Babao” can be understood as some “cultural authorities” within the county town – such as teachers, doctors, well-known merchants, and officials. Although their positions may seem ordinary, in this relatively closed environment, they possessed a comparatively higher social status, or their opinions and actions had influence that could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-the-county-town-brahmin&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is the “County Town Brahmin”?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In county towns, you’ll find figures like this – the “Brahmin” – in almost every industry. They might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educators:&lt;/strong&gt; Particularly teachers who have spent decades working in the area, not necessarily graduates of prestigious universities, but who understand how to build credibility through knowledge and are widely respected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Government Officials:&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy county magistrates, section chiefs, etc., who control certain resources and power – even if their positions aren’t high-ranking, their limited scope of authority can make them local “Brahmins.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local “Entrepreneurs”:&lt;/strong&gt; Some business owners in county towns, though not large in scale, hold a certain amount of wealth and have a voice in the area. They might run one or two well-known small local businesses, wielding considerable influence within the county town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people, while not as prominent as figures in larger cities or high-ranking officials, hold a status almost equivalent to “cultural elders” or “centers of power” within this small community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-status-of-county-town-brahmins--how-does-it-impact-society&#34;&gt;The Status of “County Town Brahmins” – How Does it Impact Society?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the significance of “county town brahmins,” we must consider the unique environment of the county town. Here, information flow is slower than in large cities, and social class mobility is relatively fixed. These “brahmins” often gained prestige, knowledge, and networks through long-term dedication to the local area. They influence various aspects of local politics, economics, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; In small places, especially where education systems are not as developed and people have limited choices, local &amp;ldquo;brahmins&amp;rdquo; subtly shape the cultural atmosphere through knowledge transmission in classrooms, explanations in media, and even moral guidance in social settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concentration of Social Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the limited population and resources of county towns, these “brahmins” are often one of the primary controllers of local resources. Whether it’s social welfare, policy implementation, or approval of certain projects, they invariably have an influence. Their power of speech and decision-making allows them to hold a prominent position in local society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Networked Structure of Relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; In a relatively closed small society, interpersonal relationships are crucial. These “county town brahmins” build strong social networks to control information flow and resource allocation, enabling them to play a decisive role at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-metaphor-of-the-county-sharma&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Metaphor of the “County Sharma”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite often being revered and admired, this position of “high above” is not without its issues. In modern society, it’s easy to see that many “Sharmas” – those in county-level positions – lack genuine ability and innovative spirit; instead, they maintain their status through hereditary relationships and resource monopolies. With the development of informatization, these “Sharmas’” power is gradually being broken, and new social mobility is beginning to influence the appearance of small counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, “County Sharma” is a fascinating social phenomenon that reflects the power and cultural structures within local societies. Although their “power” may not directly threaten national governance, they are undoubtedly key figures within the region. In this era of rapid information flow and accelerating social change, these “Sharmas” in county towns may be facing unprecedented challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this would have happened if we hadn’t started with curiosity about what a ‘purohito’ was, and then tossed it to &lt;code&gt;kimi&lt;/code&gt;. The result was surprisingly funny – I could see the web interface already pulling up search results, but suddenly they were unable to be displayed as related content. Then I wondered, did this word have some special significance? So I threw it at &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt;, and that&amp;rsquo;s how this article came about.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Balancing Bank Marketing Strategies with the Art of Personal Financial Management</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 01:33:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the renovation project at home has led to a surge in daily expenses. I’ve also been using credit cards, paying them off within the billing cycle, although I have enough cash on hand, I prefer to keep it in money funds to earn some additional interest income. Furthermore, to ensure financial stability, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up automatic payment functionality so that my credit card bills can be paid promptly upon maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-status-deposits-increase-loans-decrease&#34;&gt;Bank Status: Deposits Increase, Loans Decrease
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst increasing economic uncertainty, people are more inclined to save rather than consume or invest. This has led to an increase in bank deposits, but it also means banks have to pay higher interest rates to depositors. Conversely, due to reduced consumer and investment activity, loan demand has decreased, making it difficult for banks to generate interest income through lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attract and retain customers, banks are forced to offer more competitive deposit rates, further compressing the bank’s net interest margin. Simultaneously, in order to stimulate economic growth and consumption, central banks may implement policies of lowering benchmark interest rates, which will also impact bank loan rates and consequently affect their profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;banking-marketing-strategies-cultivating-user-habits&#34;&gt;Banking Marketing Strategies: Cultivating User Habits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The due date is almost here. First, the Bank of Communications contacted me, offering a one-year free installment payment service with no interest charges. Shortly after, China Merchants Bank also provided installment interest discounts of 2.5% off, equivalent to an annualized interest rate of 1.9%. Faced with these offers, I chose to accept installment services from both banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that banks are truly willing to invest heavily in cultivating user habits. According to the bank’s definition of “flow,” I should be a premium customer. In the current context of difficulty for banks in lending and deploying funds, by fostering my installment awareness, the bank is actually preparing for potential liquidity difficulties that may arise from me in the future, at which point they can earn more interest income from me. After all, as we know, interest rates on credit card bill analysis are not low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks use free installment services and low-interest installment offers to not only increase the frequency and amount of credit card usage but also to establish a positive image in the minds of users. This shift in strategy reflects the bank’s rapid response to market changes and its deep understanding of customer needs. In this way, the bank not only solves the problem of difficulty in lending and deploying funds, but also lays the groundwork for future profits – &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s not just about making money today; looking ahead is key to long-term success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-personal-financial-management&#34;&gt;The Importance of Personal Financial Management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the appealing offers of installment financing from banks, as users, we should recognize the risks associated with over-reliance on credit card installments. We should carefully consider our repayment ability and future financial needs to avoid falling into long-term debt traps due to short-term financial convenience. Key to personal financial management is balancing current needs with future planning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s digital age, games have evolved far beyond a simple form of entertainment and become an integral part of people&amp;rsquo;s daily lives. From a psychological perspective, games play different roles in the mental development of individuals across various age groups, while also being closely intertwined with social and recreational activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-state&#34;&gt;Mental State
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people are in the stage of self-exploration and identity formation. &lt;strong&gt;Games provide them with a low-cost environment to try and explore.&lt;/strong&gt; Through games, they can experiment with different roles and lifestyles, satisfying their curiosity and desire for exploration. As they grow older, individuals’ interests and values gradually stabilize, and games may no longer align with their life goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes&#34;&gt;Social Attributes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the game has also become a part of social activities, particularly for young people. They make friends and build social networks through games, making games a bridge for socialization. However, as people age, their social circles gradually stabilize, and social needs may be met through more mature ways, leading to a relative reduction in the role of games in socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes-bringing-a-sister&#34;&gt;Social Attributes: Bringing a Sister
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within China, due to a lack of education regarding romantic relationships, parents often simply expect you to study diligently and then immediately focus on finding a partner after graduation. This phenomenon is quite common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of busy studies, work, or a lack of social skills, individuals are unable to establish stable emotional relationships in real life, leading to feelings of loneliness and a desire for attention. &lt;strong&gt;The “bringing a sister” behavior within games provides them with an outlet to release this craving.&lt;/strong&gt; By helping and protecting female players, they can experience being needed and valued, achieving emotional satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the interactive rules within games are clearly defined, and the environment is controllable, offering a sense of certainty and security compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real life, reducing fear of the uncertainties in real-life interactions. However, long-term reliance on virtual gratification within games can potentially impact their ability to build and maintain healthy emotional relationships in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-world-pressure&#34;&gt;Real-World Pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games provide a virtual world where players can temporarily escape the pressures, challenges, or unpleasant emotions of real life. Particularly for young people facing academic pressure, family issues, or interpersonal relationship challenges, games may become a way to seek comfort and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are typically designed to give players a sense of accomplishment and recognition when completing tasks, leveling up, or defeating opponents. Young people may become addicted to games because they can experience a feeling of being appreciated and recognized within them – a feeling that may be lacking in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dislike-playing-after-getting-older&#34;&gt;Dislike Playing After Getting Older
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young, individuals face relatively fewer social responsibilities and pressures, allowing them more time and energy to invest in gaming. As they enter the workforce or start families and other social responsibilities increase, time and energy become more valuable, and games may be seen as a drain on resources rather than a prioritized leisure activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, their cognitive abilities and interests also change. They might have been interested in fast-paced, visually stunning games when younger, but with increased experience, they may prefer strategy games, those with strong storylines, or games with greater depth. If the market doesn’t meet these changing needs, interest naturally diminishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game Psychology: Competitive Gaming</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-competitive-gaming/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 10:26:22 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-competitive-gaming/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games of the &amp;ldquo;pay-to-win&amp;rdquo; type, here we will not discuss this; within the gaming community, this is collectively referred to as “Renminbi Warriors” – requiring an affluent wallet rather than understanding game settings. Their enjoyment lies in the entourage of smaller players surrounding them and the thrill of “raid.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive games with a large audience, such as: League of Legends, DOTA, Honor of Kings, PUBG, these types of games have complete worldviews and their game competitions have entered a benign cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology is indeed a key field in game design, and social psychology is particularly important. Understanding people’s behavior, needs, and motivations can help design more engaging gaming experiences. Regarding the relationship between “showing off” and social psychology, we can look at it from the following angles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Identity:&lt;/strong&gt; People often seek to establish a sense of identity within social groups. In games, if designs allow players to feel they are outstanding in some way, attracting the attention of other players, this may increase their social identity. This could manifest as boasting skills or showcasing earned rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games have adopted social competition elements, encouraging players to showcase their achievements on social networks. This can be achieved through leaderboards, achievement systems, or multiplayer battles. Such designs stimulate competitive psychology between players and may lead some players to perform more impressively to gain social recognition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Expression:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games allow players to express themselves through customizing characters, virtual items, etc. This self-expression is not just for showing off; it can also be a way of expressing personality and social communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teamwork:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games emphasize teamwork, achieving game goals through social interaction. In such situations, boasting behavior may not be encouraged but rather emphasizes collaboration and mutual support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Reward Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design can adopt psychological reward systems to stimulate positive social behaviors in players. For example, rewarding or granting privileges to players to encourage them to actively participate in social interactions.
Overall, social psychology in game design can be used to shape player interaction and social experiences. Boasting behavior may exist in some situations, but game designers typically strive to balance this behavior to ensure that the gaming experience is positive and interesting for all players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about where I was writing, without a complete outline, it’s a bit chaotic.
The author often plays League of Legends, which is a memory of our generation. Most parents don&amp;rsquo;t like their children playing games because they haven&amp;rsquo;t deeply understood or experienced this type of game; of course, it has to do with the game settings. Each game is a new beginning, and for many children, when they play, they don’t bring much thought into it, belonging to self-exploration gameplay. Under this mode, the outcome of the game depends more on the child&amp;rsquo;s inherent gaming talent. Based on my actual experience, a large part of the players belong to this type, for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost is not money, but time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s also entertainment mode within the game, designed to cater to recreational players. League of Legends, this competitive game, for me, was more about realizing a “Three Kingdoms dream.” Starting off, you have nothing in your pockets, relying on your own understanding, farming, spending money, controlling vision, setting traps and ambushes for the opponent – it’s largely about thinking your way through the game. Without exceptional gaming talent, you can still find immense enjoyment. The feeling of commanding the overall situation, the joy of turning a losing game around. And there are also many viewers who often mention “casual players” – they no longer play the game but still watch the matches during major world events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s worth mentioning “game time.” This isn&amp;rsquo;t referring to the duration of a single match, but rather the amount of time you spend in the game – on weekends in the afternoons, or evenings between 7 pm and 10 pm after work. You’ll find that you can usually communicate normally with your teammates, and your signals are understood and responded to. If you switch to other times, such as playing through the night, you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to encounter “gaming addicts,” favorable situations where nothing happens, and in unfavorable situations, they’ll complain about you to your family – you can almost feel their resentment through the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As someone who works in the IT industry and plays a lot of games, I’ve tried various types, always preferring to think my way through the game rather than relying on reaction speed or talent. Compared to professionals or younger players, my reactions are slower, and I&amp;rsquo;m accustomed to coordinating with teammates and taking command of the team’s strategy. When I first started playing, it was during my student years, guided by older brothers from an YY guild.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, regarding the current game environment, it feels quite agitated and lacks the purity of before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After graduating, playing high-level segment games was really exhausting. The entire game required intense focus, thinking about the opponent&amp;rsquo;s plans, and how to counter their setups. It’s that kind of experience where you don’t want to continue after finishing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s be honest, if you’re considered a very good player, without professional competition, it wouldn’t have much impact on your life trajectory. While it can serve as a social tool, it&amp;rsquo;s not something you can make a living from or establish yourself in society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-player games and online games are two different types of games that differ significantly in their gameplay, experience, and technology. Here are some key aspects to understand the differences between single-player and online games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connection Method:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games (Offline/Single-player):&lt;/strong&gt; These games are played on a local device alone, without requiring an internet connection. Players can enjoy the game experience even without network connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games (Online/Multiplayer):&lt;/strong&gt; This type of game typically requires an internet connection because players need to interact with other players in real time. Online games can be cooperative or competitive, involving online social interaction and esports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player Interaction:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players primarily interact with artificial intelligence, pre-set tasks, or opposing elements within the game. The gaming experience is generally more personalized, influenced by the in-game design and storyline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players can interact with other real players from around the world. This may include collaborating on missions, competing against each other, or participating in esports competitions, as well as social elements like chat, guild systems, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Design and Content:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design focuses more on providing a complete, independent storyline and gaming experience. The game content is typically pre-designed, and players explore, solve puzzles, or fight within the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design needs to consider real-time interaction and player competition or collaboration. The game content may be more dynamic, including regular updates, online events, and social interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Generally run offline, with relatively low requirements for device performance and internet connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Require a strong internet connection and high demands on server and network performance to ensure smooth real-time interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Models:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Typically use one-time purchase or download business models, where players buy the game to play it fully on their local devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; May employ various business models such as free-to-play, advertising, item purchases, or subscriptions to maintain server operations and continuously update game content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these differences helps players clarify their preferences when choosing games and allows game designers to better meet player expectations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
