        <title>Multi-dimensional impacts of the family planning policy: deep transformations from social structure to economic and political changes.</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;China’s population control policies, while limiting growth and curbing family-style development, have disrupted traditional social structures, suppressed the expansion of family-owned businesses and political dynasty power, presenting a unique case compared to South Korean conglomerates and Indian family monopolies. Now that birth restrictions are being relaxed, despite facing challenges such as low fertility rates, it’s crucial to be wary of new monopoly risks and seek balance through multiple avenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;one-the-disjunction-between-population-control-and-family-style-development&#34;&gt;One: The Disjunction Between Population Control and Family-Style Development
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family planning policy, which has been a fundamental national strategy in China for nearly forty years, has achieved significant direct results. Data shows that from 1978 to 2007, the natural growth rate of China’s population declined from 12‰ to 5.2‰, resulting in a reduction of over 40 million people, and the proportion of the Chinese population worldwide decreased from 22.2% to 20.1%. This sharp decline in population growth profoundly reshaped family structures within Chinese society. Taking family-owned enterprises as an example, after the implementation of the family planning policy, the number of children born by business owners declined significantly: before the policy, the proportion of those having three or more children reached 40.63%, and after the policy it plummeted to 18.46%, the proportion of single sons born increased from 6.25% to 32.31%. This structural change directly reduced the range of potential internal successors for family-owned enterprises, objectively suppressing their generational expansion capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Korea and India, the differences are significant. Although Korea did not implement strict family planning policies, its birth rate has remained low (0.7 in 2023), however, its chaebols have maintained control over the national economy through cross-shareholdings and tax avoidance mechanisms. The total revenue of the top five chaebols accounts for more than 50% of Korea’s GDP, with Samsung Group alone accounting for 20% of the country&amp;rsquo;s GDP. India, on the other hand, presents a different picture: 79% of economic output is contributed by family-owned enterprises, and six major conglomerates control key sectors such as telecommunications and steel, with twenty top companies earning 80% of national corporate profits. The core of this difference lies in the fact that China’s family planning policy, through limiting family size, has weakened the human resources base for family-owned enterprise expansion from the source, while Korea and India have been able to sustain their influence in economic sectors due to different policy environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;two-monopoly-restraint-and-social-structural-transformation&#34;&gt;Two. Monopoly Restraint and Social Structural Transformation
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the economic sector is particularly evident in its suppression of monopoly phenomena. Due to the reduced number of children within Chinese family businesses, the formation of Han-Indian style conglomerates like those led by chaebols was difficult. Taking Korea as an example, chaebols maintained control through “circular investment,” with the Samsung family holding only 2% of the group’s shares but controlling the entire operation through complex equity structures. In China, after the family planning policy, family businesses generally faced the dilemma of “passing down from father to son,” often necessitating the introduction of professional managers or implementing equity diversification reforms. According to a湃新闻 (Papare News) study, the proportion of female successors in family businesses after family planning increased from 13.85% to 34.21%, and the education level of these successors significantly improved, with the percentage of college graduates rising from 43.75% to 98.46%. While this transformation has not completely eliminated family control, it has significantly reduced the possibility of a single family monopolizing the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the social structural level, the family planning policy accelerated the disintegration of traditional family core models. The average household size in China decreased from 4.41 people/household in 1982 to 2.62 people/household in 2020, weakening the family’s functions in areas such as economics, education, and social support. In contrast, India maintains a family size of around 4 people, with the caste system deeply intertwined with family power, leading to low social mobility. China&amp;rsquo;s transformation of household structure created space for individualism, with the number of single adult citizens reaching 240 million in 2023, and a trend of “one-person economy” emerging in the consumer market – further diminishing the influence of family economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;three-decentralization-of-power-in-the-political-sphere&#34;&gt;Three. Decentralization of Power in the Political Sphere
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the political landscape has been profound. Traditionally, family power structures had infiltrated grassroots politics through bloodlines and kinship relationships. For example, the 161 political families in Henan’s Xinye County virtually controlled all government departments, with 20% of cadres at deputy-level or above belonging to “officer’s children.” However, after the implementation of the family planning policy, shrinking family sizes limited the expansion of family networks. Research from Peking University showed that the number of offspring of officials decreased after family planning, and the complexity of family political networks significantly declined. Furthermore, the policy-driven promotion of education (the average years of schooling increased from 5.2 in 1982 to 10.9 in 2023) facilitated social mobility, weakening the monopoly of family power over political resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison with South Korea and India, the deep entanglement between Korean conglomerates and politics (such as Samsung Group executives engaging in bribery with government officials) and the hereditary family politics under the Indian caste system highlighted the uniqueness of China’s policy. China objectively reduced the possibility of power succession through the family planning policy. Despite the presence of family phenomena in county-level politics, the overall trend is towards the decentralization of the power structure. During the 2025 National People&amp;rsquo;s Congress meeting, a CPPCC member proposed renaming “The Law on Population and Family Planning” to “The Law on Population and Reproduction,” fully opening up childbirth – a move that may further influence the future evolution of the political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;four-challenges-and-opportunities-following-policy-adjustments&#34;&gt;Four, Challenges and Opportunities Following Policy Adjustments
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the 2016 comprehensive two-child policy and the 2021 three-child policy marked a significant shift in China’s birth policies. However, the effects were limited: In 2022, the birth rate was only 1.18, far below the replacement level (2.1). The relaxation of birth restrictions had a dual impact on family-owned enterprises: On one hand, some entrepreneurs may strengthen their family succession capabilities through multiple births, such as Zong Qinghui, the daughter of Zhong Quehui of Wahaha Group in Zhejiang, who took over as the sole heir; on the other hand, high childcare costs (the average cost of raising a child to 18 years old in first-tier cities reaches 10 million yuan) and declining fertility intentions among professional women limited the expansion of family size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the economic sphere, relaxing birth restrictions may give rise to new monopoly forms. The three-child policy has accelerated the concentration of the maternal and childcare industry, with the market size of infant and toddler care expected to reach 1621.3 billion yuan in 2025. Leading companies have consolidated smaller manufacturers through mergers and acquisitions, resulting in a CR5 market concentration exceeding 55%. This increase in concentration may bring efficiency, but it also needs to be wary of new monopoly risks. The government must seek a balance between encouraging births and preventing market concentration, such as strengthening regulation through antitrust laws while providing childcare subsidies (such as Hangzhou’s three-child families receiving a monthly milk powder subsidy of 3000 yuan) to reduce family burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the political sphere, relaxing birth restrictions may have subtle impacts on family power structures. Although it is unlikely to restore traditional family political networks in the short term, from a long-term perspective, multi-child families may form new influence in grassroots politics. Therefore, improving personnel selection mechanisms and strengthening supervision (such as establishing a cadre relative appointment avoidance system) are still crucial for preventing hereditary power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;five-international-mirroring-and-future-outlook&#34;&gt;Five. International Mirroring and Future Outlook
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiences of South Korea and India demonstrate that the ebb and flow of family power is closely linked to policy orientations. South Korea achieved economic takeoff by supporting conglomerates, but at the cost of social inequality; India’s failure to implement effective policies to curb family monopolies has exacerbated wealth disparity. China&amp;rsquo;s population control policy effectively suppressed the expansion of family powers while simultaneously creating problems such as an aging population and labor shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, China needs to find a new balance between population policy and socio-economic development. On one hand, it should increase birth rates through fertility support policies (such as extending maternity leave and building accessible childcare institutions); on the other hand, it must strengthen antitrust enforcement to prevent family businesses from forming new monopolies through capital operations. In the political sphere, further progress is needed in grassroots democracy construction, strengthening oversight mechanisms, and ensuring transparency in governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, population control policies were a key driver of social change in China, with impacts far exceeding the realm of population. They reshaped family structures, economic models, and the political landscape, providing a path for China to avoid falling into the trap of family monopolies seen in Korea and India. As policies are adjusted, balancing efficiency and equity, freedom and order within the new demographic context will be a long-term challenge facing China.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AI Development Over Two Years: Somewhat similar to the state before a Docker release – fragmented and rapidly evolving.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-like-docker-pre-release/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:16:37 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-like-docker-pre-release/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been one of the most hotly debated topics in the technology field in recent years, particularly over the past two years, with AI technology experiencing rapid advancements. Whether it’s deep learning, natural language processing, or computer vision and automated decision systems, the application scenarios for AI are constantly emerging. However, despite continuous technological breakthroughs, AI still faces a bottleneck similar to that of a Docker release – a lack of a killer app to truly ignite the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article: AI has developed for two years, which is somewhat like the state of Docker’s pre-release, lacking a killer application, based on existing technologies, create a perfect landing scenario, Docker did not use too many new technologies, but the overall solution is reasonable, and it changes the workflow of operations and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-development-status-the-technology-is-mature-but-applications-still-need-breakthroughs&#34;&gt;AI Development Status: The Technology is Mature, but Applications Still Need Breakthroughs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, AI has made significant progress in the past two years. Whether it’s OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT series models or Google’s BERT and DeepMind’s Alpha series, AI processing capabilities have far exceeded previous expectations. Particularly in the field of natural language processing, models like GPT-4 not only possess powerful generative abilities but also demonstrate astonishing performance in understanding and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite technological advancements, AI&amp;rsquo;s implementation in practical applications faces certain challenges. Similar to Docker’s state before its release, although AI has enormous potential, there hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet been a truly widespread and industry-changing killer app. People are talking about the prospects of AI, but they may not be able to find an application that can directly bring about revolutionary changes. Many AI applications remain in their initial stages of experimentation, and most require further integration and optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker-and-ai-parallels-technology-doesnt-have-to-be-innovation-its-about-the-solution&#34;&gt;Docker and AI Parallels: Technology Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Have to Be Innovation, It’s About the Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at Docker’s release history, we can readily see many similarities between the technological environment at the time and the current state of AI development. Before Docker, container technology wasn’t a new concept; early technologies like LXC (Linux Containers) and virtualization already possessed the basic capabilities for containerization. However, Docker didn&amp;rsquo;t introduce disruptive technology itself. Instead, it presented a simpler, more intuitive, and efficient solution through the clever integration and optimization of existing technologies. This solution didn’t rely on revolutionary technological breakthroughs, but rather addressed many pain points in software deployment, scaling, and management processes, significantly simplifying the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the AI field is facing a similar situation. While current AI technology isn&amp;rsquo;t “new,” achieving truly large-scale applications still requires a perfect implementation scenario – just like Docker, integrating and optimizing existing technologies to form a reasonable application solution. Killer AI applications may not rely on entirely new technological breakthroughs, but rather on how to integrate existing technologies to solve practical business pain points and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-ais-docker-moment&#34;&gt;How to Find AI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Docker Moment&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly enable the widespread adoption of AI technology, we need to focus on several key areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Exploration of Practical Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;
Currently, many AI applications are still largely experimental and lack large-scale real-world implementation.  For example, while AI customer service and intelligent recommendations are widely used, their functionality is often limited and hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet broken through industry bottlenecks. True breakthroughs may come from industries that have been struggling with traditional methods for a long time, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics. AI can help these companies improve efficiency and reduce costs in complex scenarios through more efficient data processing and predictive analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productization and Ease of Use&lt;/strong&gt;
Just like Docker simplifies containerization processes to boost operational efficiency, the ease of use of AI products is equally crucial. The widespread adoption of AI isn&amp;rsquo;t just about technological proliferation; it’s also about product proliferation. Integrating AI into daily workflows, allowing users to easily utilize these tools without needing to deeply understand the technology, is a key step in AI implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecosystem Building and Standardization&lt;/strong&gt;
Any new technology’s widespread adoption relies on ecosystem building. Docker&amp;rsquo;s rapid rise was due to its openness and compatibility, enabling developers to seamlessly integrate with various cloud platforms, tools, and services. Similarly, the future of AI depends on the construction of an ecosystem.  Standardization of AI, model sharing, data openness, and technological interoperability will all influence whether AI can form widespread industry applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-the-future-of-ai-is-full-of-possibilities-but-requires-more-refined-implementation&#34;&gt;Conclusion: The Future of AI is Full of Possibilities, but Requires More Refined Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant advancements in AI technology over the past two years, it remains in the stage of “lacking killer applications” at present. Similar to containerization technology before Docker’s release, AI needs a reasonable application scenario that deeply integrates existing technologies with business requirements to truly achieve large-scale adoption and widespread use. While technological innovation is important, solutions that simplify processes and improve efficiency are more likely to drive the popularization and development of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, AI may evolve like Docker – not through disruptive technological breakthroughs, but by integrating existing technologies to create a perfect application scenario, ultimately changing the way we work and live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Echoes of bygone years, offering unconventional fantasies and emotional solace.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 22:12:57 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the earliest web novel readers entered middle age, the type of “revenge” stories catered to them also evolved. The protagonists often appeared as fathers, mentors, or elderly figures, meeting the different needs and demands of middle-aged readers for life and emotion. These works no longer solely focused on upgrades and reversals; instead, they emphasized emotional resonance and life reflections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;target-audience-shifting-reader-base-amidst-the-passage-of-time&#34;&gt;Target Audience: Shifting Reader Base Amidst the Passage of Time
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former web novel readers have largely transitioned into middle age. They’ve experienced the trials and tribulations of life, leading to shifts in their mindset and values. The passionate, adventurous elements they once chased are no longer the sole focus for them. Instead, they seek emotional resonance with their current lives and a sense of nostalgia for past years, as well as aspirations for the future. Middle-aged爽文 (shuangwen - a popular genre) emerged specifically to meet this psychological need. It utilizes plot settings that closely align with the lives and attitudes of middle-aged readers, attracting this particular demographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;role-shift-from-young-hero-to-middle-aged-guardian&#34;&gt;Role Shift: From Young Hero to Middle-Aged Guardian
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Students Are All Villains:&lt;/strong&gt; The protagonist, Lu Zhou, after becoming a master, faces a group of disciples with diverse personalities and formidable strength. They teeter between good and evil, and Lu Zhou needs to guide them towards the right path. This novel showcases the challenges and confusion faced by middle-aged individuals when educating the next generation through interactions with their disciples. Furthermore, the growth and transformation of the disciples offer hope and a glimpse into the future, mirroring expectations for one’s children or younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emotional-resonance-life-reflections-and-family-responsibilities&#34;&gt;Emotional Resonance: Life Reflections and Family Responsibilities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sixty-Year-Old Birthday System:&lt;/strong&gt; The protagonist gained a system upon turning sixty, embarking on a new life journey. This setting allows middle-aged readers to feel a sense of “it’s never too late” hope and inspiration. Even having reached old age, the protagonist can still realize their value and dreams through the system. This plot encourages readers to reflect on missed opportunities and unfulfilled dreams in their own lives, while also conveying an optimistic attitude, encouraging them not to give up pursuing their goals at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-design-aligning-with-the-rhythm-and-humor-of-middle-age-life&#34;&gt;Plot Design: Aligning with the Rhythm and Humor of Middle Age Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot designs for middle-aged “revenge” novels often place a greater emphasis on the details of life and the nuanced expression of emotions. Unlike young adult revenge novels that prioritize rapid upgrades and adventures, they focus more on relationships between characters and emotional entanglements. For example, in &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Master Craftsman&lt;/em&gt;, the protagonist’s friendship with his apprentice, their brotherhood with fellow disciples, etc., are all depicted in detail. This plot design allows middle-aged readers to feel a sense of warmth and familiarity, as if they were seeing their own family relationships, friendships, and love lives.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The End of the Age of Wild Capitalism: The Era of League of Legends Esports Concludes</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-league-of-legends-era/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:19:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-league-of-legends-era/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The esports industry has experienced rapid development over the past decade and a half, becoming an increasingly significant cultural phenomenon worldwide. Particularly MOBA games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; (LoL), which is often abbreviated as LOL, not only provide players with the joy of competition but also inject powerful momentum into capital, driving the flourishing development of various esports platforms and events. However, all of this has entered a phase of gradual decline with the influx of capital and the rise of the entertainment industry. The rise and fall of PandyTV, the competition between DouYu and Huya, marks the end of the “wild capitalism era,” and the favorable conditions – time, place, people, and heaven – for esports seem to be starting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-injection&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Injection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1 The Early Days of Electronic Sports: From Grassroots to Professionalization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early esports industry started relatively grassroots, especially in China. Many players participated in competitive games like &lt;em&gt;StarCraft&lt;/em&gt; and Dota, driven by their passion for the games. However, the true rise of esports began with the release and promotion of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Following the official entry of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; into the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche community to part of mainstream culture. Notably starting in 2013, the LPL (China Professional League) was established, and &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; became the cornerstone of China’s esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.2 Capital Frenzy Influx: The Rise of PandaTV and Esports Live Streaming Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 marked a watershed moment for the Chinese esports industry. The influx of capital transformed esports from a purely competitive event into a much larger ecosystem. PandaTV, one of the representatives, became a product of excessive capital. Invested by one of its founders, Wang Sicong, PandaTV quickly rose to prominence with its innovative content and massive investment, attracting a large number of viewers and users. However, this was also a typical example of capital “barbaric” inflow – the relentless pursuit of markets often lacks patience and long-term vision. Although PandaTV’s short-term investments achieved certain results due to management issues and excessive reliance on high fever caused by capital, it ultimately declared bankruptcy in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.3 Live Streaming Platform Competition: The “Capital War” Between DouYu and Huya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demise of PandaTV did not lead to the decline of the esports live streaming industry; instead, it propelled the rise of platforms like Douyu and Huya. Douyu and Huya became leading players in the esports industry, and their competition intensified. Early on, Douyu established itself as a benchmark for esports live streaming through the broadcasting of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; professional competitions and the signing of top streamers. Huya, meanwhile, gradually narrowed the gap with Douyu by increasing its investment in esports events and diversifying its platform layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, capital played a huge role again. In 2018, Douyu successfully went public, and Huya also completed its IPO the same year. The rapid flow of capital led to industry consolidation and intensified competition between platforms in terms of streamers and copyrights, forming a “capital war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-fusion-of-mass-entertainment-and-esports&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Fusion of Mass Entertainment and Esports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1 The Trend Towards Mass Entertainment: Capital Flows into Diversified Entertainment Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As capital has heavily invested in the esports industry, esports platform content is gradually becoming mass-entertained. Esports anchors are no longer limited to match commentary and event live streaming; they have begun to expand into singing, dancing, interactive live streams, and other entertainment forms. The content on platforms is becoming more diverse, gradually forming an ecosystem centered around esports but also incorporating various entertainment elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this mass entertainment trend has also brought problems – the original focus of esports culture has been marginalized, replaced by a trend of entertainment above all else. This trend has caused some fans who originally loved esports culture to feel alienated, and capital has begun to pay more attention to other entertainment fields. The excessive influx of capital and profit-seeking behavior have gradually blurred the essence of the esports industry, and the original value concept centered around competition has been weakened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2 The Rise of Mass Entertainment Industry: Capital Withdrawal and Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and the entertainment industry have risen, capital has gradually shifted funds from esports to a wider range of entertainment content. In this process, giants such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance no longer rely solely on esports projects as sources of revenue, but are increasing their investments in areas such as film, music, and short videos.  In particular, the rise of ByteDance, through the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin (TikTok), has overshadowed the limelight of esports with other entertainment content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-league-of-legends-yellow-not-following-yellow-the-decline-of-the-eras-advantage&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: League of Legends’ “Yellow Not Following Yellow”: The Decline of the Era’s Advantage
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has almost become synonymous with China&amp;rsquo;s esports industry, achieving countless professional players, teams, and events, and also spawning a massive esports ecosystem. However, after more than ten years, as a leading project in Chinese esports, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; has entered a phase of “Yellow Not Following Yellow” – a period of decline. Particularly in recent years, the influence of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; is gradually waning, even exhibiting obvious signs of recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1 The “Fracture” in Player Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most noticeable change is the fragmentation of player groups. Initially, esports’ rapid development relied on the support of a large number of young players, many of whom became professional players or spectators thanks to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. That generation of &amp;ldquo;internet addiction&amp;rdquo; teenagers almost grew up under the “era’s advantage,” immersed in the competitive charm of LOL and thus driving the rapid expansion of the entire industry. However, as time went on, these players gradually matured, entered society, and began to shift towards other life and career paths. At the same time, a new generation of young players are not as enthusiastic about &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; as in its heyday, and the esports audience has exhibited a clear age bias and decline in interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2 The “Weakness” in Game Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, after multiple updates and revisions, still maintains a certain competitive charm, but the game’s own innovation in content appears somewhat lacking. Each year&amp;rsquo;s version updates, hero balance adjustments, and new gameplay introductions seem unable to fundamentally address players’ demand for freshness. Meanwhile, the MOBA market has become saturated, and other types of games (such as &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Game For Peace&lt;/em&gt;) have rapidly risen, diverting a large number of players who originally belonged to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. This competitive situation has left &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; unable to escape the role of “follower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-where-does-the-esports-industry-go-from-here&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Where Does the Esports Industry Go From Here?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The esports industry is like a skyscraper that sprung up seemingly overnight, with excessive capital roaming the internet sector, searching for the next big trend – and esports has become one of their targets. Leveraging China’s demographic dividend, the industry achieved tremendous success in a short period, but this success wasn&amp;rsquo;t built on a solid foundation. Excessive capital influx, talent shortages, and weak game content are all hindering the healthy development of the esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to university, I didn’t play many games; Alliance essentially accompanied my growth alongside generations. I watched countless World Finals, and as an outsider, comparing ourselves to Korean and Chinese players, especially Faker, domestic players always felt hesitant during major tournaments. I also know that athletes face immense psychological pressure, but this hasn&amp;rsquo;t been prioritized by teams. Over a decade of development, these mental health issues should be taken seriously, yet they weren’t. Domestic gameplay still relies on the innate talent of the players themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Town Brahmin: The “Big Man” of Small Places</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:02:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, the popular &amp;ldquo;Da Bing&amp;rdquo; (Big Ice) on Douyin (TikTok) has been frequently seen with short video accounts extracted from her live streams. A listener who joined a live call asked: “Da Bing, I want to sell my house in Xi’an and return home to settle down.” Da Bing responded: “At your age, you&amp;rsquo;re in your early thirties; you can&amp;rsquo;t settle down. Your parents are on the path of aging, your children haven’t started a family or established themselves, and if you return home, you’ll still need to deal with the &lt;em&gt;poren&lt;/em&gt;.”
Let’s set aside whether the viewpoint is right or wrong, what does the term “poren” mean?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;township-brahmins-the-big-shots-of-small-places&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Township Brahmins: The “Big Shots” of Small Places&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many small county towns, people often talk about so-called &amp;ldquo;township brahmins&amp;rdquo;—the existence of these individuals seems to be a symbol of local society. They are not necessarily genuine religious figures and do not possess “high-level” titles; rather, they are seemingly ordinary but nonetheless influential people. They represent “power, status, and influence” within that county town, symbolizing a particular class or stratum in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-xiancheng-babao&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an “Xiancheng Babao?”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand that “Babao” originally referred to the highest caste in Indian society, representing wisdom, authority, and spiritual supremacy. In China’s county towns, the term “Xiancheng Babao” doesn&amp;rsquo;t have such a complex religious background; it’s more of a metaphor for a social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, an “Xiancheng Babao” can be understood as some “cultural authorities” within the county town – such as teachers, doctors, well-known merchants, and officials. Although their positions may seem ordinary, in this relatively closed environment, they possessed a comparatively higher social status, or their opinions and actions had influence that could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-the-county-town-brahmin&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is the “County Town Brahmin”?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In county towns, you’ll find figures like this – the “Brahmin” – in almost every industry. They might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educators:&lt;/strong&gt; Particularly teachers who have spent decades working in the area, not necessarily graduates of prestigious universities, but who understand how to build credibility through knowledge and are widely respected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Government Officials:&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy county magistrates, section chiefs, etc., who control certain resources and power – even if their positions aren’t high-ranking, their limited scope of authority can make them local “Brahmins.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local “Entrepreneurs”:&lt;/strong&gt; Some business owners in county towns, though not large in scale, hold a certain amount of wealth and have a voice in the area. They might run one or two well-known small local businesses, wielding considerable influence within the county town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people, while not as prominent as figures in larger cities or high-ranking officials, hold a status almost equivalent to “cultural elders” or “centers of power” within this small community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-status-of-county-town-brahmins--how-does-it-impact-society&#34;&gt;The Status of “County Town Brahmins” – How Does it Impact Society?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the significance of “county town brahmins,” we must consider the unique environment of the county town. Here, information flow is slower than in large cities, and social class mobility is relatively fixed. These “brahmins” often gained prestige, knowledge, and networks through long-term dedication to the local area. They influence various aspects of local politics, economics, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; In small places, especially where education systems are not as developed and people have limited choices, local &amp;ldquo;brahmins&amp;rdquo; subtly shape the cultural atmosphere through knowledge transmission in classrooms, explanations in media, and even moral guidance in social settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concentration of Social Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the limited population and resources of county towns, these “brahmins” are often one of the primary controllers of local resources. Whether it’s social welfare, policy implementation, or approval of certain projects, they invariably have an influence. Their power of speech and decision-making allows them to hold a prominent position in local society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Networked Structure of Relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; In a relatively closed small society, interpersonal relationships are crucial. These “county town brahmins” build strong social networks to control information flow and resource allocation, enabling them to play a decisive role at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-metaphor-of-the-county-sharma&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Metaphor of the “County Sharma”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite often being revered and admired, this position of “high above” is not without its issues. In modern society, it’s easy to see that many “Sharmas” – those in county-level positions – lack genuine ability and innovative spirit; instead, they maintain their status through hereditary relationships and resource monopolies. With the development of informatization, these “Sharmas’” power is gradually being broken, and new social mobility is beginning to influence the appearance of small counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, “County Sharma” is a fascinating social phenomenon that reflects the power and cultural structures within local societies. Although their “power” may not directly threaten national governance, they are undoubtedly key figures within the region. In this era of rapid information flow and accelerating social change, these “Sharmas” in county towns may be facing unprecedented challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this would have happened if we hadn’t started with curiosity about what a ‘purohito’ was, and then tossed it to &lt;code&gt;kimi&lt;/code&gt;. The result was surprisingly funny – I could see the web interface already pulling up search results, but suddenly they were unable to be displayed as related content. Then I wondered, did this word have some special significance? So I threw it at &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt;, and that&amp;rsquo;s how this article came about.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Balancing Bank Marketing Strategies with the Art of Personal Financial Management</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 01:33:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the renovation project at home has led to a surge in daily expenses. I’ve also been using credit cards, paying them off within the billing cycle, although I have enough cash on hand, I prefer to keep it in money funds to earn some additional interest income. Furthermore, to ensure financial stability, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up automatic payment functionality so that my credit card bills can be paid promptly upon maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-status-deposits-increase-loans-decrease&#34;&gt;Bank Status: Deposits Increase, Loans Decrease
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst increasing economic uncertainty, people are more inclined to save rather than consume or invest. This has led to an increase in bank deposits, but it also means banks have to pay higher interest rates to depositors. Conversely, due to reduced consumer and investment activity, loan demand has decreased, making it difficult for banks to generate interest income through lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attract and retain customers, banks are forced to offer more competitive deposit rates, further compressing the bank’s net interest margin. Simultaneously, in order to stimulate economic growth and consumption, central banks may implement policies of lowering benchmark interest rates, which will also impact bank loan rates and consequently affect their profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;banking-marketing-strategies-cultivating-user-habits&#34;&gt;Banking Marketing Strategies: Cultivating User Habits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The due date is almost here. First, the Bank of Communications contacted me, offering a one-year free installment payment service with no interest charges. Shortly after, China Merchants Bank also provided installment interest discounts of 2.5% off, equivalent to an annualized interest rate of 1.9%. Faced with these offers, I chose to accept installment services from both banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that banks are truly willing to invest heavily in cultivating user habits. According to the bank’s definition of “flow,” I should be a premium customer. In the current context of difficulty for banks in lending and deploying funds, by fostering my installment awareness, the bank is actually preparing for potential liquidity difficulties that may arise from me in the future, at which point they can earn more interest income from me. After all, as we know, interest rates on credit card bill analysis are not low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks use free installment services and low-interest installment offers to not only increase the frequency and amount of credit card usage but also to establish a positive image in the minds of users. This shift in strategy reflects the bank’s rapid response to market changes and its deep understanding of customer needs. In this way, the bank not only solves the problem of difficulty in lending and deploying funds, but also lays the groundwork for future profits – &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s not just about making money today; looking ahead is key to long-term success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-personal-financial-management&#34;&gt;The Importance of Personal Financial Management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the appealing offers of installment financing from banks, as users, we should recognize the risks associated with over-reliance on credit card installments. We should carefully consider our repayment ability and future financial needs to avoid falling into long-term debt traps due to short-term financial convenience. Key to personal financial management is balancing current needs with future planning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The multifaceted nature of gaming: the intersection of psychological development and social entertainment.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 15:07:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s digital age, games have evolved far beyond a simple form of entertainment and become an integral part of people&amp;rsquo;s daily lives. From a psychological perspective, games play different roles in the mental development of individuals across various age groups, while also being closely intertwined with social and recreational activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-state&#34;&gt;Mental State
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people are in the stage of self-exploration and identity formation. &lt;strong&gt;Games provide them with a low-cost environment to try and explore.&lt;/strong&gt; Through games, they can experiment with different roles and lifestyles, satisfying their curiosity and desire for exploration. As they grow older, individuals’ interests and values gradually stabilize, and games may no longer align with their life goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes&#34;&gt;Social Attributes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the game has also become a part of social activities, particularly for young people. They make friends and build social networks through games, making games a bridge for socialization. However, as people age, their social circles gradually stabilize, and social needs may be met through more mature ways, leading to a relative reduction in the role of games in socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes-bringing-a-sister&#34;&gt;Social Attributes: Bringing a Sister
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within China, due to a lack of education regarding romantic relationships, parents often simply expect you to study diligently and then immediately focus on finding a partner after graduation. This phenomenon is quite common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of busy studies, work, or a lack of social skills, individuals are unable to establish stable emotional relationships in real life, leading to feelings of loneliness and a desire for attention. &lt;strong&gt;The “bringing a sister” behavior within games provides them with an outlet to release this craving.&lt;/strong&gt; By helping and protecting female players, they can experience being needed and valued, achieving emotional satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the interactive rules within games are clearly defined, and the environment is controllable, offering a sense of certainty and security compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real life, reducing fear of the uncertainties in real-life interactions. However, long-term reliance on virtual gratification within games can potentially impact their ability to build and maintain healthy emotional relationships in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-world-pressure&#34;&gt;Real-World Pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games provide a virtual world where players can temporarily escape the pressures, challenges, or unpleasant emotions of real life. Particularly for young people facing academic pressure, family issues, or interpersonal relationship challenges, games may become a way to seek comfort and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are typically designed to give players a sense of accomplishment and recognition when completing tasks, leveling up, or defeating opponents. Young people may become addicted to games because they can experience a feeling of being appreciated and recognized within them – a feeling that may be lacking in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dislike-playing-after-getting-older&#34;&gt;Dislike Playing After Getting Older
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young, individuals face relatively fewer social responsibilities and pressures, allowing them more time and energy to invest in gaming. As they enter the workforce or start families and other social responsibilities increase, time and energy become more valuable, and games may be seen as a drain on resources rather than a prioritized leisure activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, their cognitive abilities and interests also change. They might have been interested in fast-paced, visually stunning games when younger, but with increased experience, they may prefer strategy games, those with strong storylines, or games with greater depth. If the market doesn’t meet these changing needs, interest naturally diminishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game Psychology: Competitive Gaming</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-competitive-gaming/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 10:26:22 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-competitive-gaming/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games of the &amp;ldquo;pay-to-win&amp;rdquo; type, here we will not discuss this; within the gaming community, this is collectively referred to as “Renminbi Warriors” – requiring an affluent wallet rather than understanding game settings. Their enjoyment lies in the entourage of smaller players surrounding them and the thrill of “raid.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitive games with a large audience, such as: League of Legends, DOTA, Honor of Kings, PUBG, these types of games have complete worldviews and their game competitions have entered a benign cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology is indeed a key field in game design, and social psychology is particularly important. Understanding people’s behavior, needs, and motivations can help design more engaging gaming experiences. Regarding the relationship between “showing off” and social psychology, we can look at it from the following angles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Identity:&lt;/strong&gt; People often seek to establish a sense of identity within social groups. In games, if designs allow players to feel they are outstanding in some way, attracting the attention of other players, this may increase their social identity. This could manifest as boasting skills or showcasing earned rewards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games have adopted social competition elements, encouraging players to showcase their achievements on social networks. This can be achieved through leaderboards, achievement systems, or multiplayer battles. Such designs stimulate competitive psychology between players and may lead some players to perform more impressively to gain social recognition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Expression:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games allow players to express themselves through customizing characters, virtual items, etc. This self-expression is not just for showing off; it can also be a way of expressing personality and social communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teamwork:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games emphasize teamwork, achieving game goals through social interaction. In such situations, boasting behavior may not be encouraged but rather emphasizes collaboration and mutual support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Reward Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design can adopt psychological reward systems to stimulate positive social behaviors in players. For example, rewarding or granting privileges to players to encourage them to actively participate in social interactions.
Overall, social psychology in game design can be used to shape player interaction and social experiences. Boasting behavior may exist in some situations, but game designers typically strive to balance this behavior to ensure that the gaming experience is positive and interesting for all players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about where I was writing, without a complete outline, it’s a bit chaotic.
The author often plays League of Legends, which is a memory of our generation. Most parents don&amp;rsquo;t like their children playing games because they haven&amp;rsquo;t deeply understood or experienced this type of game; of course, it has to do with the game settings. Each game is a new beginning, and for many children, when they play, they don’t bring much thought into it, belonging to self-exploration gameplay. Under this mode, the outcome of the game depends more on the child&amp;rsquo;s inherent gaming talent. Based on my actual experience, a large part of the players belong to this type, for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost is not money, but time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s also entertainment mode within the game, designed to cater to recreational players. League of Legends, this competitive game, for me, was more about realizing a “Three Kingdoms dream.” Starting off, you have nothing in your pockets, relying on your own understanding, farming, spending money, controlling vision, setting traps and ambushes for the opponent – it’s largely about thinking your way through the game. Without exceptional gaming talent, you can still find immense enjoyment. The feeling of commanding the overall situation, the joy of turning a losing game around. And there are also many viewers who often mention “casual players” – they no longer play the game but still watch the matches during major world events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s worth mentioning “game time.” This isn&amp;rsquo;t referring to the duration of a single match, but rather the amount of time you spend in the game – on weekends in the afternoons, or evenings between 7 pm and 10 pm after work. You’ll find that you can usually communicate normally with your teammates, and your signals are understood and responded to. If you switch to other times, such as playing through the night, you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to encounter “gaming addicts,” favorable situations where nothing happens, and in unfavorable situations, they’ll complain about you to your family – you can almost feel their resentment through the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As someone who works in the IT industry and plays a lot of games, I’ve tried various types, always preferring to think my way through the game rather than relying on reaction speed or talent. Compared to professionals or younger players, my reactions are slower, and I&amp;rsquo;m accustomed to coordinating with teammates and taking command of the team’s strategy. When I first started playing, it was during my student years, guided by older brothers from an YY guild.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, regarding the current game environment, it feels quite agitated and lacks the purity of before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After graduating, playing high-level segment games was really exhausting. The entire game required intense focus, thinking about the opponent&amp;rsquo;s plans, and how to counter their setups. It’s that kind of experience where you don’t want to continue after finishing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s be honest, if you’re considered a very good player, without professional competition, it wouldn’t have much impact on your life trajectory. While it can serve as a social tool, it&amp;rsquo;s not something you can make a living from or establish yourself in society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-player games and online games are two different types of games that differ significantly in their gameplay, experience, and technology. Here are some key aspects to understand the differences between single-player and online games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connection Method:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games (Offline/Single-player):&lt;/strong&gt; These games are played on a local device alone, without requiring an internet connection. Players can enjoy the game experience even without network connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games (Online/Multiplayer):&lt;/strong&gt; This type of game typically requires an internet connection because players need to interact with other players in real time. Online games can be cooperative or competitive, involving online social interaction and esports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player Interaction:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players primarily interact with artificial intelligence, pre-set tasks, or opposing elements within the game. The gaming experience is generally more personalized, influenced by the in-game design and storyline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players can interact with other real players from around the world. This may include collaborating on missions, competing against each other, or participating in esports competitions, as well as social elements like chat, guild systems, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Design and Content:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design focuses more on providing a complete, independent storyline and gaming experience. The game content is typically pre-designed, and players explore, solve puzzles, or fight within the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design needs to consider real-time interaction and player competition or collaboration. The game content may be more dynamic, including regular updates, online events, and social interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Generally run offline, with relatively low requirements for device performance and internet connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Require a strong internet connection and high demands on server and network performance to ensure smooth real-time interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Models:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Typically use one-time purchase or download business models, where players buy the game to play it fully on their local devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; May employ various business models such as free-to-play, advertising, item purchases, or subscriptions to maintain server operations and continuously update game content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these differences helps players clarify their preferences when choosing games and allows game designers to better meet player expectations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
