        <title>The multifaceted impacts of the family planning policy: profound changes from social structure to economic and political spheres</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s family planning policy, while limiting population growth, curbed the development of family-based enterprises, undermined traditional social structures, and suppressed the expansion of family businesses and political influence. Compared to South Korea’s chaebols and India’s family monopolies, its uniqueness is evident. Now that birth restrictions have been lifted, although challenges such as low birth rates are faced, new monopoly risks must also be guarded against, and a balance needs to be sought through multiple avenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;i-population-control-and-the-rise-and-fall-of-family-style-development&#34;&gt;I. Population Control and the Rise and Fall of Family-Style Development
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family planning policy, serving as a fundamental national policy in China for nearly forty years, has yielded significant direct results. Data shows that from 1978 to 2007, the natural population growth rate of China decreased from 12‰ to 5.2‰, resulting in over 400 million fewer births and reducing the proportion of the world’s population held by China from 22.2% to 20.1%. This sharp decline in population growth has profoundly reshaped the family structure of Chinese society. Taking family businesses as an example, after the implementation of the family planning policy, the number of children born to business owners decreased significantly: before the policy, 40.63% had three or more children, while after the policy, this figure plummeted to 18.46%, and the proportion of single-child births increased from 6.25% to 32.31%. This structural change directly led to a significant reduction in the range of internal successors available for family businesses, objectively inhibiting their ability to expand across generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the situations in South Korea and India, the differences are significant. Although South Korea has not implemented strict family planning policies, its birth rate has been persistently low (0.7 in 2023). However, chaebols maintain a firm grip on the national economy through means such as cross-shareholdings and inheritance tax avoidance. The combined revenue of the five major chaebols accounts for over 50% of South Korea&amp;rsquo;s GDP, with Samsung alone accounting for 20% of the national GDP. India presents another picture: 79% of economic output is contributed by family businesses, and six conglomerates control key areas such as telecommunications and steel. The profits of 20 top companies account for 80% of the total profits of all enterprises in the country. The core difference lies in that China&amp;rsquo;s family planning policy, by limiting family size, weakens the human resource foundation for the expansion of family businesses from the source. Due to different policy environments, both South Korea and India have allowed family influence to continuously penetrate the economic sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;monopoly-restraint-and-social-structure-transformation&#34;&gt;Monopoly Restraint and Social Structure Transformation
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the economic sector is particularly evident in its suppression of monopolies. Due to reduced daughters, Chinese family businesses have struggled to form chaebol-style groups like those in Korea. Take South Korea as an example: chaebols maintain control through &amp;ldquo;circular investment,&amp;rdquo; with the Samsung family holding only 2% of the group&amp;rsquo;s shares but controlling everything through a complex equity structure. In China, family businesses after the implementation of family planning policies generally face the dilemma of “succession by offspring,” forcing them to introduce professional managers or undergo diversified equity reforms. Research by The Paper shows that the proportion of female successors in family businesses has increased from 13.85% to 34.21% after family planning, and their education levels have also significantly improved, with the percentage of bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree or higher increasing from 43.75% to 98.46%. While this transformation hasn’t completely eliminated family control, it has significantly reduced the possibility of a single family monopolizing the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the level of social structure, the family planning policy accelerated the disintegration of the traditional family core model. Household size in China decreased from 4.41 people per household in 1982 to 2.62 people per household in 2020; smaller families have weakened the functions of the family in terms of economic, educational, and social support. In contrast, India&amp;rsquo;s household size remains around 4 people, with the caste system deeply linked to family power, resulting in low social mobility. The transformation of China’s family structure has created space for individualistic development; by 2023, China had 240 million single adults, and the consumption market is seeing a trend of rising &amp;ldquo;individual economies.&amp;rdquo; This shift further diluted the influence of family economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;three-decentralization-of-power-in-the-political-sphere&#34;&gt;Three, Decentralization of Power in the Political Sphere
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the political landscape is equally profound. Traditionally, familial forces have infiltrated grassroots politics through kinship and marriage ties. For example, in Xinyi County, Henan Province, 161 political families virtually controlled all government departments, with 20% of cadres at the deputy section level or above being “second-generation officials.” However, after the implementation of the family planning policy, the reduction in family size limited the expansion of familial networks. Research from Peking University shows that the number of children among officials decreased after the family planning policy, and the complexity of political family networks declined significantly. In addition, the policy promoted education普及 (popularization), increasing the average years of schooling from 5.2 in 1982 to 10.9 in 2023, which facilitated social mobility and weakened the monopoly of familial forces on political resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing South Korea and India, the deep entanglement of Korean chaebols with politics (such as financial transactions between Samsung executives and the government) and the hereditary family politics under India&amp;rsquo;s caste system highlight the uniqueness of Chinese policies. China’s family planning policy has objectively reduced the possibility of power inheritance. Although familial phenomena still exist in county-level politics, the overall trend is a decentralization of the power structure. During the 2025 National People&amp;rsquo;s Congress and Chinese People&amp;rsquo;s Political Consultative Conference, a CPPCC member proposed renaming the &amp;ldquo;Law on Population and Family Planning&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Law on Population and Reproduction,&amp;rdquo; advocating for fully relaxing birth restrictions – a move that may further influence the evolution of future political ecology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;challenges-and-opportunities-after-policy-adjustments&#34;&gt;Challenges and Opportunities After Policy Adjustments
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the two-child policy in 2016 and the three-child policy in 2021 marked a significant shift in China’s birth policies. However, the effect has been limited: the fertility rate in 2022 was only 1.18, far below the replacement level (2.1). The relaxation of birth restrictions presents a dual impact on family businesses: on one hand, some entrepreneurs may enhance their family succession capabilities through having more children, such as Zong Fuli, the daughter of Quinghao from Zhejiang Wahaha Group, who is a single child taking over the business; on the other hand, high childcare costs (the average cost of raising a child to 18 in first-tier cities reaches 1 million yuan) and declining willingness among working women to have children limit family expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Releasing restrictions on births could give rise to new monopolies in the economic sphere. The three-child policy is driving concentration within industries such as maternal and infant products, and childcare, with the early childhood care market expected to reach 162.13 billion yuan by 2025. Leading companies are integrating smaller firms through mergers and acquisitions, resulting in a CR5 (concentration ratio of the top 5) exceeding 55%. While this concentration may bring efficiency gains, it also warrants vigilance regarding new monopoly risks. The government needs to seek a balance between encouraging childbirth and preventing market concentration, for example, by strengthening regulation through antitrust laws, while providing childcare subsidies (such as the 3000 yuan monthly milk powder subsidy available to families with three children in Hangzhou) to reduce family burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Releasing restrictions on birth rates may have subtle impacts on family power in the political sphere. While it will be difficult to restore traditional family political networks in the short term, over the long run, families with multiple children could potentially form new influence at the grassroots level. Therefore, improving cadre selection mechanisms and strengthening supervision (such as establishing a system of recusal for relatives of cadres) remains key to preventing power inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;v-international-lessons-and-future-prospects&#34;&gt;V. International Lessons and Future Prospects
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiences of South Korea and India demonstrate that the rise and fall of family power is closely related to policy orientation. South Korea achieved economic takeoff by supporting conglomerates (chaebols), but at the cost of social equity being damaged; India, due to a lack of effective policies to curb family monopolies, has seen widening wealth inequality. China’s birth planning policy, while controlling population, objectively suppressed the expansion of family power, but also brought about issues such as accelerated aging and labor shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, China needs to seek a new balance between population policy and socioeconomic development. On one hand, it should increase birth rates through supportive policies (such as extending maternity leave and building inclusive childcare facilities); on the other hand, it must strengthen antitrust enforcement to prevent family businesses from forming new monopolies through financial operations. In the political sphere, further progress is needed in grassroots democracy construction, improving oversight mechanisms, and ensuring transparency in power operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the family planning policy, as a significant driver of social change in China, has an impact far beyond the population sphere. It reshaped family structures, economic models, and the political landscape, providing a path for China to avoid falling into a Korean-Indian style trap of familial monopolies. As policies adjust, how to balance efficiency with fairness, freedom with order within the new demographic context will be a long-term challenge facing China.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Trade war suddenly put on hold</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 19:07:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of tariffs in the 2025 trade war presented a cycle of &amp;ldquo;escalation — retaliation — consultation,&amp;rdquo; as the US-China competition shifted from tariff confrontation to rules-based competition. While short-term easing alleviated market pressure, long-term uncertainty remains, and it is necessary to monitor the continued impact on the global economy from WTO rulings, supply chain adjustments, and geopolitical changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can&amp;rsquo;t earn money beyond their own understanding. The stock market crash triggered by the trade war this year, even now that losses have been largely recovered, has buried countless small investors along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the timeline for tariffs in trade wars in 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a breakdown of the 2025 trade war tariff timeline, incorporating key events from China, the US, and other countries to illustrate the evolving dynamics of tariff policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-april-2025-comprehensive-tariff-escalation-and-retaliation&#34;&gt;I. April 2025: Comprehensive Tariff Escalation and Retaliation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US tariffs on China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 2, the Trump administration signed Executive Order 14257, announcing a 34% tariff on goods imported from China, covering products from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 8th, the United States further increased tariffs on Chinese goods from 34% to 84% and signed Executive Orders 14259 and 14266, imposing additional tariffs on more products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 10th: The White House revised an executive order, raising the total tariffs on China to 145%, and increasing tariffs on small packages (such as raising the tax rate on goods under $800 from 90% to 120%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s countermeasures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 4th, China announced tariffs of 34% on all goods originating from the United States, covering areas such as agricultural products, automobiles, and energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 10th, China will raise retaliatory tariffs from 34% to 84%, matching the escalation by the US side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 12th: China canceled 91% of the tariffs imposed on US goods (corresponding to the portion cancelled by the US side) and suspended the implementation of the remaining 24% tariffs for 90 days, retaining 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariff disputes among other countries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US-Canada trade war: The United States has imposed a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum products from Canada. Canada retaliated by imposing tariffs on US$298 billion worth of American goods and filed a complaint with the WTO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The EU is imposing tariffs of up to 25% on US goods, while Japan has expressed concerns about tariffs on US automobiles, calling the trade war &amp;ldquo;harmful to both sides.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-may-2025-geneva-talks-and-tariff-easing&#34;&gt;II. May 2025: Geneva Talks and Tariff Easing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China-U.S. High-Level Economic and Trade Talks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From May 10th to 11th, China and the United States held 16 hours of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, reaching the &amp;ldquo;China-US Geneva Trade Talks Joint Statement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 12th: Both sides announced suspension of some tariffs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United States has suspended 24% of tariffs on China (for 90 days), retained 10%, and canceled additional taxes scheduled for April 8th and 9th&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China will suspend 24% of retaliatory tariffs, retain 10%, and remove non-tariff measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both sides agreed to establish a consultation mechanism and regularly hold trade consultations in China, the United States, or a third country, focusing on tariff reduction and rule-making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Impact and Policy Adjustments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US domestic pressure: High tariffs are causing small and medium-sized enterprises to go out of business (such as Amazon sellers being forced to close due to soaring tariffs), and inflation expectations are heating up (core PCE is expected to rise to 3.3%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s rare earth countermeasures: China has tightened controls on rare earth exports, cracked down on smuggling, and impacted the US military industry and new energy supply chain, forcing them to seek waivers for tariffs on rare earths and other key minerals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-other-key-events-and-long-term-impacts&#34;&gt;III. Other Key Events and Long-Term Impacts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WTO and multilateral response&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canada and China have separately filed appeals with the WTO over US steel and aluminum tariffs and &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; alleging violations of the non-discrimination principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned that US tariffs could cause a 1% contraction in global trade volume in 2025 and exacerbate the difficulties faced by developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exemption List and Industry Impact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US exemption goods: A 37-page list covering strategic materials such as rare earths, graphite, and medical CT tubes exposes supply chain vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US tariffs on imported cars of 25% have led to a global forecast of a 2% decline in auto production, with a 9% reduction in North America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political and strategic game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration attempted to reshape the international trade order through &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; but was criticized as unilateral bullying, triggering a backlash from allies (such as the EU and Japan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China is responding to protectionism by expanding market access (such as the China International Import Expo, and zero-tariff commitments) and attracting cooperation from developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-of-timeline&#34;&gt;Summary of Timeline
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Event&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 2, 2025, the United States will impose a 34% tariff on China, covering goods from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 8th, the United States will raise tariffs on China to 84% and introduce new tax administrative orders&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 10, China retaliated with a tariff of 34%, later raised to 84%; the US revised its tariffs to 145%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 12, the United States exempted certain goods (such as technology products), and China canceled 91% of its retaliatory tariffs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;US, China and Japan talks in Geneva reached a joint statement agreeing to suspend 24% tariffs (for 90 days)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On May 12, both sides announced a suspension of tariffs and a negotiation mechanism, easing trade tensions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;five-trends-and-challenges&#34;&gt;Five: Trends and Challenges
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-term easing and long-term competition: The suspension of tariffs between China and the US sends a positive signal, but structural contradictions (such as high technology and energy) remain, and midterm elections may affect policy continuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global supply chain restructuring: Companies are accelerating adjustments to their supply chains, with Mexico and Southeast Asia benefiting from “nearshoring,” but rising costs may dampen the recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The predicament of multilateral mechanisms: The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is constrained, regional trade agreements (such as the UK-US agreement) have become alternative options, but this exacerbates fragmentation&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Jiangxi Province&#39;s Special Post and National Civil Servant Teacher Recruitment Data (2020-2025): Trends and Insights into Change</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2020-2025 teacher recruitment in Jiangxi Province shows a significant reduction trend: the number of special post teachers recruited decreased sharply from 6,617 to 32 (a decrease of 99.5%), and national cadre teachers decreased from 11,324 to 2,146 (a decrease of 81.1%). The proportion of core subjects (language, mathematics, English) remains stable but the total number is shrinking; although the proportion of subjects such as music, arts, and physical education has increased, the absolute numbers are limited (e.g., only 2 people were recruited in 2025 for each). Policy changes have implemented &amp;ldquo;one position reduction, one position replacement&amp;rdquo; staffing restrictions, with teacher resources shifting towards vocational education and remote areas, leading to a significant reduction in traditional primary and secondary school positions. In 2025, the planned number for some subjects was zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of specialized teaching positions recruited annually in Jiangxi Province, statistics for the past five years, categorized by subject and compiled into a table&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;——————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to recruitment announcements and public data released by the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, the Department of Human Resources and Social Security, and other official bodies, here is a summary of the hiring situation for special-post teachers and national civil servant teachers from 2020-2025. It should be noted that &lt;strong&gt;the 2025 data represents planned recruitment numbers&lt;/strong&gt;, and subject details were not fully disclosed in some years; disciplines marked as &amp;ldquo;not subdivided&amp;rdquo; in the table represent total statistics or missing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-data-description&#34;&gt;III. Data Description
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data sources: Annual recruitment announcements and official statistics from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education and the Human Resources and Social Security Department (actual figures for 2020-2024, planned figures for 2025)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject Classification
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specialized teachers focusing on compulsory education subjects in rural areas will be limited to a small number of core subject positions in 2025&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The national curriculum covers all grade levels, with a more comprehensive range of subjects, including early childhood education and special education (not listed separately due to data not being subdivided)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trend analysis
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall recruitment sharply decreased: The number of specialized positions for teachers in 2025 is down 99.5% compared to 2020, and the number of national civil service teachers is down 81.1%, reflecting changes in population structure and adjustments to educational resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hot and Cold Topics in Academic Fields
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, Mathematics, and English) remains stable, but recruitment volume is shrinking year by year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of subjects such as arts, physical education, and music has increased, but the absolute numbers are limited (e.g., only 2 students will be admitted for each of arts, physical education, and music in 2025)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some subjects (such as English) have stopped admitting new students due to a decrease in student numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policy Background:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tightening of staffing quotas: Implementing a “replace one with one” policy, strictly controlling new quota allocations, and achieving a 68.6% proportion of off-quota positions in 2024&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structural adjustments: Teacher resources will be directed towards vocational education and remote areas, with a significant reduction in hiring for traditional primary and secondary schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The Celestial Realm of Medical Education and the Butterfly Effect of the Dong Xi Ying Incident</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-sky-dong-xiying-butterfly-effect/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 01:08:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-sky-dong-xiying-butterfly-effect/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Peking Union “4+4” program (4 years of non-medical undergraduate studies + 4 years of medical doctoral studies) emphasizes interdisciplinary elite training. The Dong Xiying incident in 2025 exposed its reliance on family background (a lineage of medical professionals/researchers) for entry into the program, raising questions about the clarity of her academic credentials and allegations of plagiarism in her thesis. This incident revealed a contradiction between the elitism of the recruitment model and fairness, while issues regarding shortened training periods and supervised practice remain unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt&#34;&gt;Prompt
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog post: The origins and development of Concordia 4+4, core points: a corner of the celestial palace glimpsed by mortals, Dong Mingmei&amp;rsquo;s family background, it’s impossible for a normal medical PhD to graduate in eight years, Dong Mingmei&amp;rsquo;s family background and educational background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-palace-of-medicine-at-peking-union-medical-college-disassembled-a-44-system&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Palace of Medicine&amp;rdquo; at Peking Union Medical College, Disassembled: A 4+4 System
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;4+4&amp;rdquo; program at Peking Union Medical College, launched in 2018, has been regarded as a “heavenly palace” for medical education in China. Designed to emulate the American medical education system, and guided by the principles of &amp;ldquo;embracing individuals with multidisciplinary backgrounds,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;embracing those who love medicine,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;embracing talent from all over the world,&amp;rdquo; this program seeks to create a break within the traditional medical education system. Its core logic lies in &lt;strong&gt;replacing the traditional 5+3+3 model (5 years for undergraduate + 3 years for master&amp;rsquo;s + 3 years for doctorate) with 4 years of non-medical undergraduate education + 4 years of doctoral training&lt;/strong&gt;, aiming to cultivate leading medical professionals with cross-disciplinary expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Celestial Palace&amp;rdquo; attribute is reflected in three dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elite Requirements for Admission:&lt;/strong&gt; Initially, applicants were required to have graduated from universities ranked within the top 50 by QS/Times/US News or among the top 10 US News liberal arts colleges (such as Barnard College). Later, while the requirement was relaxed to include institutions ranked within the top 100, a GPA of 3.6 or higher, or being in the top 30% of their class, remained necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internationalization of training pathways: adopting an American-style organ-system integrated curriculum and PBL teaching method, students must complete core courses such as anatomy and pathology within 4 years, and participate in clinical internships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The controversy surrounding the quality of graduates: Although the pass rate for the national medical licensing examination (95.2%) is slightly lower than the traditional eight-year program (98.5%), most graduates enter hospitals affiliated with Peking Union Medical Center, and their career development shows no significant difference from the traditional path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dong-xi-ying-incident-cracks-in-heavenly-palace-seen-by-ordinary-people&#34;&gt;The Dong Xi-ying Incident: Cracks in &amp;ldquo;Heavenly Palace&amp;rdquo; Seen by Ordinary People
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, a report of extramarital affairs involving Dr. Xiao Fei, a thoracic surgeon at the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital, unexpectedly revealed the &amp;ldquo;mysterious veil&amp;rdquo; surrounding the Peking Union Medical Center&amp;rsquo;s 4+4 project. The resume of the involved party, Dong Xiying, has raised three questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ambiguity of educational background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The controversy surrounding Dong Xiying&amp;rsquo;s academic credentials: she claims to have graduated from Columbia University, but in fact attended its affiliated college, Barnard College (ranked 14th in the 2025 US News liberal arts colleges). Although the school meets Concordia’s “Top 20 Liberal Arts Colleges” requirement, its diploma simultaneously lists &amp;ldquo;Barnard College&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Columbia University,&amp;rdquo; which can easily be mistaken for a degree from Columbia&amp;rsquo;s main campus in the domestic recruitment market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional Cross-Disciplinary Controversy&lt;/strong&gt;: The path of an undergraduate degree in economics combined with a doctorate in clinical medicine, while meeting the &amp;ldquo;multidisciplinary background&amp;rdquo; positioning of the 4+4 program, has been questioned for lacking a foundation in pre-medical coursework. Her doctoral dissertation, &amp;ldquo;Research on Multi-Modal Image Fusion Technology in Medical Image Analysis,&amp;rdquo; has been accused of high similarity to a Beijing University of Science and Technology invention patent, suspected of academic misconduct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The particularity of family background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Academic resource monopoly: His father is a secretary at the China Metallurgical Corporation Research Institute, his mother is an associate dean at the Beijing University of Technology Engineering Technology Research Institute, his grandfather is an academician in the field of imaging at Peking Union Medical College, his maternal grandparents are foreign academicians in the field of materials science, and his aunts and uncles are professors at Peking University. This &amp;ldquo;medicine + research + university&amp;rdquo; composite family background provides him with hidden resources such as letters of recommendation (requiring two biomedical associate professors) and scientific research cooperation (such as patents from Beijing University of Technology).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career trajectory jumps: transitioning from thoracic surgery to urology during the residency period, with research spanning multiple fields including orthopedics, gastroenterology, and imaging – leading to accusations of &amp;ldquo;paving the way with resources.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amplification of the debate over the academic system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rationale for time compression: traditional medical doctorates require 11 years (5+3+3), while the 4+4 program compresses this to 8 years. Although Peking Union Medical College emphasizes &amp;ldquo;curriculum integration&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;early clinical exposure,&amp;rdquo; some doctors point out that its clinical internship time (12 months) is still less than the traditional eight-year system (18 months), which may affect skill accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The controversy over internship exemptions: Some internship bases allow 4+4 graduates to be exempted from one year of internship, raising concerns about undermining fairness in the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-predicament-of-medical-education-behind-the-controversy&#34;&gt;The predicament of medical education behind the controversy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dong Xi-ying incident reflects the deep-rooted contradictions in China&amp;rsquo;s medical education system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conflict Between Elitism and Fairness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;application-review system&amp;rdquo; of the 4+4 project is essentially a transplant of the American medical school model, but China lacks standardized exams like the MCAT, and subjective evaluations such as letters of recommendation and research experience are easily influenced by family background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data shows that among the 2023 graduates with a 4+4 program, 30% came from Tsinghua, Peking University, and Fudan University combined, 25% came from overseas prestigious universities, and family background had a significant impact on applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realities of reform in the education system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of time compression: The research output of 4+4 students (such as the number of papers) is significantly lower than that of the traditional eight-year system, and has been criticized for prioritizing clinical practice over research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different levels of recognition within the industry: Top-tier hospitals value the Peking Union Medical Center brand, while community hospitals are cautious about the clinical abilities of 4+4 program graduates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dilemma of Integrating Medical Education with International Standards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US 4+4 model requires passing the MCAT exam and completing a 3-7 year residency, while China&amp;rsquo;s 4+4 program simplifies the admission and residency stages, resulting in a superficial resemblance but not the substance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to data from the Ministry of Education, in the 2024 national enrollment for medical doctoral programs, the proportion of 4+4 projects is less than 5%, and their large-scale promotion still faces obstacles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-reconstructing-the-celestial-palace-order-of-medical-education&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Reconstructing the &amp;ldquo;Celestial Palace&amp;rdquo; Order of Medical Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding the Union 4+4 project is fundamentally a clash between elite education and public expectations. When a corner of &amp;ldquo;Tiangong&amp;rdquo; (meaning space station, metaphorically referring to top-tier medical training) is glimpsed by ordinary people, what&amp;rsquo;s exposed isn&amp;rsquo;t just flaws in individual cases, but deeper contradictions within the entire medical education system. Future reforms need to focus on three levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparent selection mechanisms: Introduce standardized tests (such as a Chinese version of the MCAT) to reduce the influence of subjective factors like letters of recommendation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend the residency training period: Restore the residency training time for 4+4 graduates to 3 years to ensure clinical competency standards are met&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen process supervision: Establish an academic integrity review mechanism and conduct rigorous originality verification for interdisciplinary research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;heavenly palace&amp;rdquo; of medical education should not be the privilege of a few, but rather a cradle for cultivating true medical elites.

        <title>Broad-based index investing: Broker ETF, Hang Seng Tech Index</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/etf-wide-index-dzt-broker-etfs-hangsheng-tech-index/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 21:58:59 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to do this – buy a good blue-chip stock and just leave it alone. But I waited for it to fall, didn&amp;rsquo;t add to my position, and sold when it rose. As a result, I never managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s more trouble than it&amp;rsquo;s worth to find suitable blue-chip stocks; instead, just pick a broad market index and buy an ETF. The current plan is: securities ETF, Hang Seng Tech Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trading strategy has a professional term: left-side dip buying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the plan is to choose a broad-based index for thorough practice; it just needs to outperform the returns of fixed deposits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brokerage-etfs&#34;&gt;Brokerage ETFs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securities ETF refers to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with China&amp;rsquo;s securities companies as their primary investment target, primarily investing in listed securities company stocks in the Chinese stock market. Securities ETFs typically track a specific securities company index, such as the Zhongxin Securities Company Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought it before, but I chased after the high price at that time and ended up losing money, so I just cleared out the position. In China&amp;rsquo;s market, every bull market sees securities firms rise; how much they rise depends on the sentiment of investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-technology-index&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Technology Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index is a stock index launched by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, designed to reflect the overall performance of the technology sector in the Hong Kong market. The index includes major tech companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, covering multiple fields such as the internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 20, 2025, the top ten constituents and their respective weightings in the Hang Seng Tech Index (code: 800700) are as follows (data compiled from multiple authoritative sources):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xiaomi Group-W (01810.HK): Approximately 8.82%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tencent Holdings (00700.HK): Approximately 8.14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alibaba Group - W (09988.HK): Approximately 7.72%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JD Group-SW (09618.HK): Approximately 7.60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meituan-W (03690.HK): Approximately 7.35%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kuaishou-W (01024.HK): Approximately 6.10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Auto (02015.HK): Approximately 6.09%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SMIC (00981.HK): Approximately 5.70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NetEase-S (09999.HK): Approximately 4.59%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ctrip Group-S (09961.HK): Approximately 4.48%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 66.6% (Some sources indicate a combined share of the top ten between 68%-69%, with differences due to varying statistical time points)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;important-notes&#34;&gt;Important Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The weighting cap mechanism: The Hang Seng Technology Index sets an 8% upper limit on the weight of individual stocks. For example, SMIC&amp;rsquo;s weighting once exceeded 8% before its March 2025 adjustment, but was subsequently passively reduced to a compliant range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constituent Stock Adjustment: On May 16, 2025, Hang Seng Index Company announced that BYD (01211.HK) will be included in the index and Century Golden Resource (00772.HK) will be removed. The adjustment will take effect on June 6. Therefore, as of today (May 20), the constituent stock list remains the pre-adjustment list, and BYD has not yet been included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Among the top ten constituents, internet technology companies (such as Tencent, Alibaba, and Meituan) are dominant, with significant weighting in new energy vehicles (Xiaomi, Li Auto) and semiconductors (SMIC), reflecting the index&amp;rsquo;s coverage of technology and the new economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data timeliness: Differences in data from different sources are mainly due to varying statistical time points. For example, data from March 2025 shows that the top ten combined accounted for approximately 69.4%, while data from May 14th showed 68.82%, reflecting the dynamic impact of market fluctuations on weighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buy-back-to-cover-losses-on-the-left-side&#34;&gt;Buy back to cover losses on the left side
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;left-side falling price replenishment&amp;rdquo; strategy is an investment approach where, during a period of continuous stock price decline, investors anticipate the price nearing a bottoming zone and proactively purchase in batches to reduce holding costs, awaiting future price rebounds for profit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method falls under the category of &amp;ldquo;left-side trading,&amp;rdquo; which means taking a contrarian position before the market has clearly bottomed out. In practice, investors typically employ a “pyramid” accumulation strategy, gradually increasing their purchase quantity as the price declines to reduce their average holding cost. For example, initially buying a certain number of shares; if the price continues to fall, then increasing the buy volume at a lower price, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce holding costs: By buying in batches during a downturn, average stock cost is diluted, creating conditions for future profits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positioning in advance: Establishing a position before the market reverses; if the judgment is correct, greater returns can be achieved when the market recovers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High risk: Continued decline in stock price may lead to greater losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding requirements: Requires sufficient funds to support continuous replenishment, and may face a situation where funds are locked up for an extended period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively speaking, &amp;ldquo;right-side trading&amp;rdquo; involves entering buy positions after the market trend is clear and there are obvious signs of price recovery, which carries relatively low risk but may miss some of the gains from the early stages of a rebound. Therefore, investors should choose a suitable trading strategy based on their risk tolerance, financial situation, and market judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory&#34;&gt;Valuation theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuation theory is a core concept in finance, designed to assess the intrinsic value of assets or companies and provide a basis for investment decisions. Through valuation, investors can determine whether the current market price of an asset is reasonable and formulate corresponding investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main valuation methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discounted Cash Flow (DCF): This method is based on the expected future cash flows generated by an asset, which are then discounted to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The DCF method emphasizes the intrinsic value of an asset and is suitable for evaluating companies with stable and predictable profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative Valuation: This method assesses a company&amp;rsquo;s relative value by comparing its valuation metrics with those of other companies in the same industry, such as price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-book ratio (P/B), and price-to-sales ratio (P/S). Relative valuation is easy to operate and widely used for quick assessments and comparisons within an industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asset-based approach determines a company&amp;rsquo;s value by assessing its net asset value, which is the difference between total assets and liabilities. This method is suitable for asset-dominant companies such as real estate firms or capital-intensive businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application of Valuation Theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment decisions: Through valuation, investors can identify undervalued or overvalued assets and formulate buy-or-sell strategies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mergers and Acquisitions: In M&amp;amp;A transactions, valuation is key to determining the transaction price and influencing the success or failure of the deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Report: The company needs to assess its assets and liabilities at fair value to ensure the accuracy and transparency of financial reports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that valuation results are affected by various factors, including market conditions, company operating status, and macroeconomic indicators. Therefore, when conducting a valuation, it is necessary to comprehensively consider all factors and combine qualitative and quantitative analysis to obtain more accurate assessment results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Two years of AI development: somewhat similar to the state before Docker was released</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-docker-pre-release/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:16:37 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-docker-pre-release/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been one of the most discussed topics in the technology field in recent years, especially with the rapid advancements in AI technology over the past two years. From deep learning and natural language processing to computer vision and automated decision-making systems, applications of AI are constantly emerging. However, despite continuous technological breakthroughs, AI still faces a bottleneck similar to that before Docker&amp;rsquo;s release – a lack of a killer application to truly ignite the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of AI over the past two years is somewhat similar to the state before Docker was released – it lacks a killer application. Based on existing technologies, we need to create a perfect practical scenario. Docker didn&amp;rsquo;t rely heavily on new technologies, but the entire solution was very reasonable and changed the workflows for operations and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-current-state-of-ai-development-technology-is-mature-but-application-still-needs-breakthroughs&#34;&gt;The current state of AI development: technology is mature, but application still needs breakthroughs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, AI has made considerable progress in the past two years. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT series models or Google&amp;rsquo;s BERT and DeepMind&amp;rsquo;s Alpha series, AI&amp;rsquo;s processing capabilities have far exceeded previous expectations. Especially in the field of natural language processing, models like GPT-4 not only possess powerful generation capabilities but also demonstrate astonishing performance in understanding and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite the rapid advancement of technology, the practical application of AI faces certain challenges. Similar to the state before Docker was released, although AI has great potential, a truly widespread and industry-transforming killer application hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet emerged. People are talking about the prospects of AI, but may not be able to find an application scenario that can directly bring revolutionary change. Many AI applications are still in the initial trial stage, and most require further integration and optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-similarity-between-docker-and-ai-technology-isnt-necessarily-innovation-solutions-are-key&#34;&gt;The similarity between Docker and AI: Technology isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily innovation, solutions are key
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the history before Docker&amp;rsquo;s release, we can easily see that the technological environment and the current state of AI development share many similarities. Before Docker was released, container technology wasn&amp;rsquo;t a new concept; early LXC (Linux Containers) and virtualization technologies already possessed basic containerization capabilities. However, Docker cleverly integrated and optimized existing technologies to propose a simpler, more intuitive, and efficient solution. This approach didn’t introduce any groundbreaking technologies but solved many pain points in operations and development processes, greatly simplifying the deployment, scaling, and management of software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the AI field faces similar circumstances. While current AI technology is no longer a &amp;ldquo;novelty,&amp;rdquo; achieving truly large-scale applications still requires a perfect landing scenario – like Docker – to integrate and optimize existing technologies into a reasonable application plan. The killer application of AI may not depend on entirely new technological breakthroughs, but rather on how to solve real business pain points and needs by integrating existing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-ais-docker-moment&#34;&gt;How to find AI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Docker moment&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly achieve widespread application of AI technology, efforts need to be made in several areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-depth exploration of real-world scenarios
Currently, many AI applications are still experimental in nature and lack large-scale practical implementation. For example, while AI customer service and intelligent recommendation fields have widespread applications, their functions still have many limitations and haven&amp;rsquo;t yet overcome industry bottlenecks. Real breakthroughs may come from industries long troubled by traditional methods, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics, where AI can help businesses improve efficiency and reduce costs through more efficient data processing and predictive analysis in these complex scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productization and Usability
Just as Docker improves operational efficiency by simplifying the containerization process, the usability of AI products is equally crucial. The popularization of AI isn&amp;rsquo;t just about the spread of technology; it’s about the popularization of its productization. Integrating AI into daily workflows and allowing users to easily use these tools without needing a deep understanding of the underlying technology is an important step in implementing AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecological Construction and Standardization
The widespread adoption of any new technology is inseparable from ecosystem development. Docker&amp;rsquo;s rapid rise is precisely due to its openness and compatibility, allowing developers to easily connect with various cloud platforms, tools, and services. Similarly, the future of AI depends on building an ecosystem. The standardization of AI, model sharing, data openness, and technical integrability will all influence whether AI can form widespread industry applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-the-future-of-ai-is-full-of-possibilities-but-a-more-complete-landing-plan-is-still-needed&#34;&gt;Conclusion: The future of AI is full of possibilities, but a more complete landing plan is still needed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although AI technology has made significant progress in the past two years, it is still in a stage of “lacking a killer application.” Similar to containerization technology before Docker’s release, AI needs a reasonable application scenario that deeply integrates existing technologies with business needs in order to truly achieve large-scale application and popularization. While technological innovation is important, solutions that simplify processes and improve efficiency are better at driving the adoption and development of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, AI may be like Docker—not through revolutionary technological breakthroughs, but by integrating existing technologies to create a perfect application scenario, ultimately changing the way we work and live&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A dramatic shift of icy and fiery in the stock market before and after National Day</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/national-holiday-stock-market-rollercoaster/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:42:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/national-holiday-stock-market-rollercoaster/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of China&amp;rsquo;s National Day in 2024, the stock market experienced a remarkable surge, but after the holiday, the market faced a dramatic plunge. This &amp;ldquo;rollercoaster&amp;rdquo; experience for investors has also prompted deep reflection on policy, economics, and market dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the theme, write a blog post about the stock market surge before last year&amp;rsquo;s National Day holiday, and be sure to include the subsequent sharp decline after the holiday. Article style: news report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-surge-before-national-day-a-policy-driven-frenzy&#34;&gt;Stock market surge before National Day: A policy-driven frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the five trading days leading up to China&amp;rsquo;s National Day in 2024, the Chinese stock market surged from a sluggish state into &amp;ldquo;boiling mode.&amp;rdquo; On September 30th, A-share markets across the board saw significant gains, with major indices reaching record highs. The Shanghai Index rose 8.06%, the Shenzhen Component Index increased by 10.67%, and the Growth Enterprise Market Index soared 15.36%. The Bilibili BELEX 50 Index even set a historic record for the largest single-day increase, jumping 22.84%. Market sentiment was extremely exuberant, with turnover on the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing exchanges reaching 2.6115 trillion yuan, a significant increase of 115.59 billion yuan compared to the previous trading day. More than 5300 stocks across the market rose collectively, creating a &amp;ldquo;sea of red&amp;rdquo; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core driving force behind this recent market trend stems from the concentrated release of a series of unexpected policies by the government and the resulting shifts in market expectations. On September 24th, the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China announced measures including reducing the reserve requirement ratio, lowering interest rates, and decreasing mortgage rates for existing loans, as well as unifying the minimum down payment ratio for mortgages. The Central Political Bureau meeting on September 26th emphasized the need to strengthen counter-cyclical adjustments through fiscal and monetary policies, work hard to boost the capital market, and vigorously guide long-term funds into the market. On September 30th, a cluster of four real estate support policies were introduced. These measures demonstrate the government&amp;rsquo;s determination to stabilize the market and promote economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-stock-markets-sharp-decline-after-national-day-calmness-and-adjustment-following-the-revelry&#34;&gt;The stock market&amp;rsquo;s sharp decline after National Day: Calmness and adjustment following the revelry
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, market sentiment took a sharp turn downward after the National Day holiday. On October 8th, A-shares opened strongly with gains nearing the daily limit, but following this significant opening rally, the market experienced violent volatility and ultimately closed higher than it opened but lower than it started. Since then, the market focus has continued to decline; as of October 16th, the Shanghai Composite Index had a fluctuation rate exceeding 15% and cumulatively fell by more than 470 points. From October 8th to 10th, core A-share indices across the board declined, with the Growth Enterprise Market Index falling by 6.21%.
The reasons for this sharp decline are partly the digestion of accumulated risks from previous rapid gains, and partly related to adjustments in market expectations regarding policies. Some investors believe that the short-term effects of policies have already become apparent, but long-term results still need to be observed. In addition, volatility in overseas markets has also impacted A shares. On October 9th, the Hang Seng Index plummeted 9.41%, and the A50 futures contract fell 10.4%, further exacerbating the market&amp;rsquo;s decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflection-on-and-prospects-for-the-market&#34;&gt;Reflection on and Prospects for the Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp volatility of the stock market before and after National Day has prompted deep reflection on policy, economy, and market mechanisms. On one hand, the short-term stimulating effects of policies are evident, but their long-term impact remains to be seen. On the other hand, the rapid rise and fall of the market also remind investors to remain rational and avoid emotional investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether A-share market can achieve a genuine “long-term bull” trend still depends on whether policies can effectively transmit to the real economy and ultimately drive substantial improvements in economic fundamentals. Investors should closely monitor the specific implementation of policies and changes in economic data, and reasonably adjust their investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp rise and fall of the stock market before and after National Day was a game between policy and the market, as well as a test of investor psychology. In this &amp;ldquo;extreme&amp;rdquo; market environment, we have witnessed both the power of the market and the influence of policy. How the market will unfold in the future remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Nezha breaks out during Spring Festival season</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-nizha-breakthrough/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:40:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-nizha-breakthrough/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As Chinese people, we always gather as a family during the Spring Festival and watching movies has become an essential form of entertainment. This year&amp;rsquo;s Spring Festival season, &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; was incredibly popular, sparking discussions everywhere. The buzz is quite similar to that of &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior,&amp;rdquo; both films exuding a patriotic theme, which unexpectedly stirs up a sense of national pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unexpected success of &amp;ldquo;Nezha&amp;rdquo; during the Spring Festival season, a surge of inexplicable national pride, reminiscent of previous films like &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior,&amp;rdquo; with patriotic themes. While acknowledging significant progress, it&amp;rsquo;s not as good as it’s being made out to be. As a gamer, many aspects feel greasy. The fight scenes are heavily influenced by online games. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen numerous posts about people buying tickets for Nezha but not actually going to see the movie due to its box office performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fight-scenes-lack-texture&#34;&gt;The fight scenes lack texture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a gamer, and I usually spend my days immersed in various online game worlds, so I didn’t have high expectations for movies. But I couldn’t resist the hype around 《Moana》, everyone was talking about it, so I thought, why not take a look? When I walked into the theater and the visuals came on, I felt a “thud” in my heart. Although the production quality has improved considerably compared to before, some of the scenes looked quite greasy. And the fight scenes? They were too heavily influenced by online games. Having played games for so many years, this visual style is too similar to some game scenes, lacking the texture that a movie should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crazy-movie-fans&#34;&gt;Crazy movie fans
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the movie, I came out and saw that quite a few people online said they bought tickets for &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; but didn&amp;rsquo;t actually watch it, all to boost its box office. I’m truly impressed by this move; it seems everyone is incredibly enthusiastic about this film and willing to do anything for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s think back to when &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; came out, when Wu Jing shouted, “Whoever dares offend China will be punished no matter how far away they are,” so many people were filled with excitement, feeling that our Chinese military was so powerful and our country so strong. Although &amp;ldquo;The Devil’s Bond&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t have such direct patriotic slogans, it vividly showcases the essence of traditional Chinese culture. Nezha and Ao Bing, these mythological figures, we grew up listening to their stories, and the film portrays their grievances, love-hate relationships, and growth process with depth and emotion – isn’t that the charm of Chinese culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Nezha. Misunderstood and looked down upon since he was a child, yet he refused to give up, shouting &amp;ldquo;My fate is my own, not the heavens’.&amp;rdquo; This spirit is so much like the resilience ingrained in our Chinese people. No matter how great the difficulties we face, we won&amp;rsquo;t bow down, but rely on our own efforts to change our destiny. Ao Bing also exemplifies this – burdened with a family mission, seemingly cold but actually kind-hearted, willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. We often see such friendship and responsibility in real life, don’t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-progress-of-animated-films&#34;&gt;The progress of animated films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect in some aspects, it combines traditional Chinese culture with modern film technology quite well, allowing us to see the progress of Chinese animated films. Just like how &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; showed everyone China’s breakthrough in the action genre. This kind of progress makes us feel that Chinese cinema can shine on the international stage and allow foreigners to appreciate the brilliance of Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chinese people, no matter where we go, we carry our country and culture in our hearts. Movies like &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; are like keys, opening the door to a sense of national pride deep within us. They allow us to feel the strength of our nation and the charm of our culture amidst laughter and joy, also inspiring us to work hard in our respective positions and contribute our share to the prosperity and development of our country. This is probably why these films have become so popular and resonate with a sense of national pride. In the future, I hope there will be more movies like this, keeping this feeling of national pride full and overflowing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Making money takes time; rushing it is useless</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:30:24 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking back on my years of stock trading experience, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t made a lot of money, I haven&amp;rsquo;t lost too much either. The biggest problem lies in the unreasonable capital flow planning and unstable mindset. Currently, my main source of income is work, earning a fixed salary through daily labor, and my tolerance for financial fluctuations still remains at the level of bonds and bank deposits. However, people are greedy; if you buy too little, you won&amp;rsquo;t make money even when prices rise; if you buy too much, you’ll lose money when they fall. At this point, a stable mindset becomes particularly important, as it can help us steady our ship of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing an article: The issue of mentality in stock investment and wealth management&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-loss-cases&#34;&gt;Historical Loss Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides dabbling in small-cap and newly listed stocks when I first started, the subsequent investments have mostly been in blue-chip large-cap stocks: Industrial Bank, China Unicom, Hengan Electronics, ZTE, and various large-cap index funds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They talk about matching bank three-year fixed deposits in terms of annualized returns, but in reality, it&amp;rsquo;s still greed for more, from rushing to increase holdings to eventually experiencing a cash flow shortage. Purchasing insurance, buying a house, and getting married are major drains on funds; the overall planning didn’t leave enough room for cash flow, leading to insufficient funds later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying blue-chip stocks is aligning yourself with &amp;ldquo;Old Money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Evergrande ran into problems, bank stocks plummeted, allowing for a successful grasp of the selling pressure. However, this demonstrates a flawed understanding of the broader economy; real estate&amp;rsquo;s share in the national economy is too large, involving too many things to allow for a &lt;strong&gt;hard landing&lt;/strong&gt;. Subsequently, the stock market continued its decline, and dividend stocks like &lt;strong&gt;Industrial Bank&lt;/strong&gt; rose steadily for about two years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the initial stage of the trade war, &lt;strong&gt;ZTE&lt;/strong&gt; suffered a major blow, with its stock price plummeting significantly, but it gradually recovered afterward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hang Seng Electronics used to be part of a larger group, and the stock price dropped significantly after Ant Financial spun off. However, this stock is controlled by market makers, and it can surge several times each year. With reasonable position control, losses will be minimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;greed-the-monster-that-devours-reason&#34;&gt;Greed: The &amp;ldquo;Monster&amp;rdquo; That Devours Reason
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greed is the most common problem in stock trading psychology. When stock prices rise steadily and investors&amp;rsquo; paper profits continue to increase, greed quietly takes root. Many people, even when the price has already reached a high level, still fantasize about it continuing to rise, eager to obtain more gains, and are reluctant to take profits. They are blinded by greed, forgetting the laws of the market and the existence of risk. For example, in some speculative hype on popular themes, some investors see prices doubling or even multiplying several times in the short term and become deeply involved, continuously increasing their holdings, hoping to be the last winner. However, the market will not remain bullish forever; when the bubble bursts and prices plummet, these greed-driven investors often suffer heavy losses. Greed robs them of their ability to analyze and make decisions rationally, turning them into &amp;ldquo;gamblers&amp;rdquo; in the stock market rather than wise investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-shackles-that-bind-your-hands-and-feet&#34;&gt;Fear: Shackles that bind your hands and feet
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is the opposite of greed. Fear is equally destructive in the stock market. When market conditions turn sharply downward and stock prices fall significantly, investors are easily caught up in panic. This fear causes them to lose confidence in the market, and even if they hold fundamentally sound stocks, they rush to sell at a loss out of fear of further losses. For example, during the global financial crisis, the share prices of many high-quality blue-chip stocks also fell sharply with the broader market. Some investors were overwhelmed by fear, failing to see the long-term value of these companies and selling their shares at extremely low prices, resulting in missed opportunities for substantial returns from subsequent market rebounds and company performance growth. Fear not only causes investors to suffer losses in the short term but can also leave them with a lasting psychological shadow, making them hesitant to re-enter the market and thus missing out on investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blindly-following-trends-a-fog-that-obscures-direction&#34;&gt;Blindly following trends: A &amp;ldquo;fog&amp;rdquo; that obscures direction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stock trading and wealth management, blindly following the crowd is another psychological trap that investors easily fall into. In this era of information explosion, various investment suggestions, market rumors, and hot news abound. Many investors lack independent thinking and judgment skills, blindly following others&amp;rsquo; actions. They see those around them making money by buying a certain stock and impulsively follow suit; they hear so-called &amp;ldquo;insider information&amp;rdquo; and invest all their savings. This blind following behavior ignores the research and analysis of the stocks themselves, leaving investors like ships lost in fog, losing their direction. For example, some concept stocks can indeed bring short-term gains to those who follow the trend at the beginning of market hype, but as the hype fades, the stock price plummets, and those who are uninformed and blindly following become &amp;ldquo;catchers&amp;rdquo; (those who buy after a decline). They fail to realize that each investor has different risk tolerance, investment goals, and investment horizons; an investment strategy suitable for others may not be suitable for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overconfidence-a-hidden-shoal&#34;&gt;Overconfidence: A Hidden &amp;ldquo;Shoal&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence is also a problem that cannot be ignored in the mindset of stock trading and wealth management. Some investors, after achieving several investment successes, begin to become inflated with pride, believing they have mastered the laws of the market and can accurately predict stock price movements. They ignore the complexity and uncertainty of the market, overtrade, blindly expand their investments, and even use high leverage for speculation. However, the market is unpredictable, and investors who are overly confident often suffer heavy losses in an unexpected market fluctuation. For example, some inexperienced but initially successful investors believe they have professional investment capabilities and begin to frequently buy and sell stocks, constantly increasing their investment amounts. When systemic risks appear or individual stocks experience sudden negative news, they fail to stop their losses in time due to overconfidence, leading to a significant reduction in capital. Overconfidence is like hidden reefs beneath the surface of the sea—seemingly calm and harmless, but capable of causing an investor&amp;rsquo;s ship of fortune to run aground and sink unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-and-invest-steadily&#34;&gt;How to adjust your mindset and invest steadily
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a correct investment philosophy: Investors should understand that stock trading and wealth management are for achieving long-term, stable asset appreciation, not getting rich quick. By learning about investment knowledge, understanding market rules, and establishing the principles of value investing and long-term investing, investors can avoid being swayed by short-term gains and market sentiment. For example, thoroughly research a company&amp;rsquo;s fundamentals, focusing on factors such as its profitability, industry position, and management team, to select stocks with long-term investment value rather than blindly chasing short-term trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a sound investment plan: Based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals, formulate a scientific and reasonable investment plan. Clearly define key elements such as investment amount, investment horizon, expected return, and stop-loss point, and strictly adhere to the plan. This can help avoid impulsive decisions driven by emotional fluctuations during the investment process. For example, limit the investment proportion of each stock to a certain percentage of your total assets, take profits when the price rises to meet your expected return, and cut losses decisively when it reaches the stop-loss point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control your emotions and stay calm: When facing market fluctuations, learn to control your emotions and remain calm and rational. You can relieve investment pressure through methods such as diverting attention, exercising, and communicating with others, avoiding negative emotional influences on investment decisions. When the market experiences significant volatility, first calmly analyze the reasons, combine your own investment strategy and stock fundamentals, and make a rational judgment instead of blindly following the trend or panicking to sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous learning and reflection: The stock market is constantly evolving, so investors need to continuously learn new investment knowledge and skills, pay attention to macroeconomic conditions, industry trends, and company information, and constantly improve their investment level. At the same time, they should regularly reflect on their own investment behavior, summarize experiences and lessons, identify problems in mindset and decision-making, and make timely adjustments and improvements. For example, after each investment, review the entire investment process, analyze the reasons for success and failure, and think about how to avoid similar mistakes in future investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in stocks and managing finances is a long and challenging journey, where mindset plays a crucial role. Only by maintaining a rational, calm, humble, and independent thinking approach can investors navigate the ups and downs of the stock market steadily and achieve wealth preservation and appreciation. Investors should regard cultivating their mindset as a mandatory course in the investment process, using a positive attitude to steer their financial ship and ensure long-term success on the path of stock investing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Alternative fantasies and emotional attachments weathered by time</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the earliest online literature readers enter middle age, the types of stories they enjoy have also changed. Protagonists now frequently appear as fathers, mentors, or elderly individuals, catering to middle-aged readers&amp;rsquo; different needs regarding life and emotions. These works no longer solely focus on leveling up and defying the odds; instead, they emphasize emotional resonance and reflections on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;target-audience-the-evolving-readership-over-time&#34;&gt;Target audience: The evolving readership over time
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once avid online literature readers, most have now entered middle age. They&amp;rsquo;ve experienced the trials of life and their mindset and values have changed. The passionate narratives and adventurous themes they once cherished are no longer their sole pursuit. Instead, they seek emotional resonance that aligns with their current lives, as well as memories of past years and expectations for the future. Middle-aged &amp;ldquo;refreshing&amp;rdquo; novels emerged from this psychological need, attracting readers within this specific demographic through storylines more relatable to middle-aged life and mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;character-transformation-from-youthful-hero-to-middle-aged-responsibility&#34;&gt;Character transformation: from youthful hero to middle-aged responsibility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Apprentice Are All Big Villains: After becoming a master, the protagonist Lu Zhou faces a group of apprentices with diverse personalities and powerful abilities. They waver between good and evil, and Lu Zhou needs to guide them towards righteousness. This novel depicts the challenges and perplexities faced by a middle-aged person when teaching the next generation through interactions between the protagonist and his apprentices. At the same time, the growth and transformation of the apprentices allows readers to see hope and the future, as if seeing their own expectations for their children or the younger generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emotional-resonance-reflections-on-life-and-family-responsibility&#34;&gt;Emotional Resonance: Reflections on Life and Family Responsibility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A protagonist gains a system on their sixtieth birthday, embarking on a new life journey. This premise allows middle-aged readers to feel a sense of &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not too late&amp;rdquo; hope and inspiration. Even though the protagonist is already in their later years, they can still realize their value and dreams through the system. This storyline reminds readers of opportunities missed and unfulfilled dreams in their own lives, while also conveying a positive attitude towards life and encouraging them to never give up on pursuing their goals at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-design-reflecting-the-rhythm-and-fun-of-middle-aged-life&#34;&gt;Plot design: Reflecting the rhythm and fun of middle-aged life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plots in mid-life &amp;ldquo;refreshing&amp;rdquo; novels often pay more attention to the details of life and the nuanced expression of emotions. They no longer pursue the fast-paced leveling up and adventure characteristic of younger refreshing stories, but instead focus on relationships and emotional entanglements between characters. For example, in “The Strongest Master,” the friendship between the protagonist and his apprentice, as well as the brotherhood among fellow disciples, are all depicted with care. This type of plot design allows mid-life readers to feel a sense of warmth and familiarity, as if seeing their own family, friendships, and love reflected in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Mystery of Spring Festival Movie Ticket Prices: Differences Between Online and Offline Sales</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/spring-festival-movie-tickets-price-mystery-online-vs-offline/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:02:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/spring-festival-movie-tickets-price-mystery-online-vs-offline/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the Spring Festival, a family of seven or eight people wanted to go see a movie. We initially planned to buy tickets on Taopihao and Maoyan, but saw the price was 60 yuan. Luckily, we had a cinema recharge card that required purchasing tickets at the front desk in person. Thinking to ask if there were any discounts, we were surprised to find that the same showing only cost 35 yuan when bought at the front desk – quite a difference in price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hidden-markups-on-platform-service-fees&#34;&gt;Hidden markups on platform service fees
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While online ticketing platforms offer convenience, their service fees are not insignificant. They create a user-friendly ticket purchasing experience, such as precise seat selection and the ability to view purchase history at any time, all of which require financial investment for maintenance. These costs are added to the ticket price in the form of platform service fees, resulting in higher online ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cinema-differentiation-operating-strategy&#34;&gt;Cinema Differentiation Operating Strategy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand for moviegoing during the Spring Festival season is surging, and theaters are using tiered pricing to maximize profits. Online platforms have high traffic, and many people are accustomed to buying tickets in advance online, so theaters set higher prices for those tickets; however, they offer lower prices to attract walk-in customers who purchase tickets directly at the front desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pricing-logic-behind-profit-sharing-cooperation&#34;&gt;The pricing logic behind profit sharing cooperation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The split of revenue between online platforms and cinemas affects ticket prices. Online platforms need to take a share from the box office, so they raise ticket prices to ensure profitability. Cinema counters sell tickets directly without any intermediary links, reducing costs, and naturally offering more affordable prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips-for-consumers-buying-tickets&#34;&gt;Tips for Consumers Buying Tickets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t just focus on online platforms when buying tickets in the future. Try calling the cinema front desk to ask about prices, or go directly to the front desk for inquiries – you might be surprised. If you’re a frequent moviegoer, getting a cinema membership card and enjoying member benefits can save you quite a bit of money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>An Analysis of Political Elements in 2025 Spring Festival Films</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-new-year-films-2025/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:49:42 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-new-year-films-2025/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I went to enjoy the atmosphere during the Spring Festival season, and this time I watched two movies, feeling it was somewhat different&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the new developments in the 2025 Spring Festival movie season, focusing on &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Guardian of the Galaxy: The Magic Child.&amp;rdquo; The former uses the backdrop of San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown in 1900 to depict the discrimination and oppression faced by Chinese people, reflecting the social and political environment. The latter, as an animated film, employs rich metaphorical elements to satirize the current international political landscape, such as the Yuxu Palace resembling the Pentagon, alluding to the American political system; dollar signs on the Tianyuan Ding symbolizing US dollar hegemony; the Immortal Jade Tablet akin to a green card suggesting hierarchical status; and the Soul-Destroying Pill similar to biological weapons hinting at malicious actions. Both films bring a new viewing experience and prompt reflection on the relationship between film art and political expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovation-in-the-style-of-spring-festival-season-films&#34;&gt;Innovation in the style of Spring Festival season films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, films released during the Spring Festival season have been lighthearted and family-friendly, aiming to help audiences relax and unwind during the holiday. However, the 2025 Spring Festival season broke with convention as &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha: Ayakoya&amp;rdquo; incorporated rich political elements, sparking widespread discussion among viewers and ushering in a new era for Spring Festival films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-vivid-reflection-of-the-eras-politics&#34;&gt;A Vivid Reflection of the Era&amp;rsquo;s Politics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;《Mystery of Tangram》is set in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown in 1900, a time when Chinese people overseas faced severe racial discrimination and oppression. As the protagonists investigate the case, they must not only solve the mystery but also confront discrimination and unfair treatment from all sides of society. The film’s portrayal of racial discrimination and power struggles realistically reflects the social and political environment of the time, allowing us to see the arduous struggle that Chinese immigrants made for survival and dignity during that turbulent era. The underlying political issues are worthy of in-depth reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such historical background inevitably brings to mind the current difficulties faced by overseas Chinese in the business sector, such as the TikTok and Zhou Shuzhong incident&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 6, 2024, local time, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected TikTok’s request and upheld the constitutionality of a law mandating its sale on national security grounds. In a memo to employees, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew wrote that the next step will be “to seek an injunction and await review by the U.S. Supreme Court.” The event originated from the passage of the &amp;ldquo;Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act&amp;rdquo; in the United States, which stipulates that ByteDance must divest its U.S. TikTok business within 270 days of the bill&amp;rsquo;s passage, with a final deadline for the forced sale of January 19, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Shou Zi Chew also faced numerous challenges at various hearings. On January 31, 2024, local time, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on &amp;ldquo;Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis.&amp;rdquo; Prominent anti-China lawmaker Tom Cotton questioned Shou Zi Chew with a series of 8 questions about nationality, including asking his country of origin, whether he had applied for Chinese or American citizenship, and even questioning the nationalities of his wife and children. Although the hearing&amp;rsquo;s theme was &amp;ldquo;online child sexual exploitation,&amp;rdquo; the senator shifted the topic to TikTok being owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, forcing Shou Zi Chew to answer questions unrelated to the subject matter. Just like the discrimination faced by Chinese people overseas in &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900,&amp;rdquo; Shou Zi Chew is experiencing unfair treatment and questioning due to TikTok&amp;rsquo;s background in the business realm. This series of events reflects that overseas Chinese have always faced numerous obstacles from external forces when pursuing their own development and protecting their rights, whether it was racial discrimination a century ago or today’s political manipulation in commerce—all of which deserve our deep reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-analysis-of-the-political-metaphor-behind-ne-zha-the-demon-child&#34;&gt;An Analysis of the Political Metaphor Behind &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha: The Demon Child&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ne Zha&amp;rsquo;s Revenge, while appearing to be an ordinary animated film, is filled with political metaphors in its various settings and plot points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping of the Power System&lt;/strong&gt;: The Biying Palace is portrayed as the supreme power center of the realm of immortals, with an architectural style similar to the Pentagon in the United States. Its interior is predominantly white, symbolizing Western hegemonic powers pushing their agenda under the guise of &amp;ldquo;universal values.&amp;rdquo; The “Demon Extermination Squad” led by Wuliang Immortal, and its subordinates, Lunu and He Nü, are believed to correspond to the US alliance system, specifically Japan and South Korea. The “online meeting” scene in Biying Palace, where the Twelve Golden Immortals sit and discuss the &amp;ldquo;War of the Conferred Gods,&amp;rdquo; is likened to NATO meetings led by the United States, which suppress other countries under the banner of &amp;ldquo;maintaining order.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The suggestion of economic hegemony: The Tianyuan Cauldron, used for alchemy in Yuxu Palace, has a dollar sign at the entrance, metaphorically representing how the United States &amp;ldquo;alchemizes&amp;rdquo; resources from other countries through economic hegemony. In the film, Wuliang Xianweng throws the dragon clan into the cauldron to be refined under the guise of “acting on behalf of heaven,” similar to how certain countries seek benefits by exploiting &amp;ldquo;international rules.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metaphor of identity and hierarchy: The jade pendant representing the divine status that Nezha receives is highly similar to a US green card in color and design, symbolizing the exclusion and hierarchical division of immortals towards &amp;ldquo;outsiders,&amp;rdquo; hinting at the differences in identity and unequal treatment between different countries and groups in reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The allusion to malicious acts: The Oblivion Pill forced on Nezha by the Immortal Wonderman, resembling a bioweapon, subtly mocks certain countries that, under the guise of &amp;ldquo;saving the world,&amp;rdquo; engage in destruction and ruin of other nations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbol of Resources and Development&lt;/strong&gt;: As a key element in reshaping the bodies of Nezha and Ao Bing, Qise Baolian (Seven-Colored Lotus) symbolizes the energy and technological lifelines monopolized by powerful nations. The acquisition of its “essence and elixir” requires passing the “immortality examination” of Yuxu Palace, reflecting the dependence of developing countries on core resources and the &amp;ldquo;rule-based predation&amp;rdquo; they face under a hegemonic system. The lotus’s temporary failure and recovery conditions allude to the survival challenges faced by small nations amidst energy crises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-deep-reflection-on-film-art-and-political-expression&#34;&gt;A deep reflection on film art and political expression
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two films incorporated political elements into the nationwide movie-going frenzy during the Spring Festival season, bringing audiences a new viewing experience. They are no longer just purely entertaining works but more like mirrors reflecting political issues in history and reality. This has sparked deep reflection on the relationship between cinematic art and political expression. Will directors increasingly convey their views on society and politics through film in future creations? Can cinema, as a powerful cultural medium, take on greater attention to and contemplation of social realities while maintaining artistic expression? These questions are worth exploring when appreciating films, and we also look forward to the film industry bringing more exciting integration of art and reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-egg&#34;&gt;Easter egg

        <title>The two major political parties in the United States—the Democratic Party and the Republican Party</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:40:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Democratic and Republican parties have significant differences in their political ideologies, policy proposals, and social values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;political-ideology-and-policy-propositions&#34;&gt;Political ideology and policy propositions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Party: leans liberal, advocates for an active role of government in economic and social affairs, supports social welfare, environmental protection, and multiculturalism. On tax policy, the Democratic Party supports tax cuts for middle- and low-income groups while raising taxes on high earners and corporations. On social issues, the Democratic Party supports abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and advocates for strict gun control. In foreign policy, the Democratic Party emphasizes multilateralism and diplomatic means, tending to resolve global issues through international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Republican Party: leans conservative, advocates for limited government intervention, and emphasizes individual freedom and market economy. On tax policy, the Republican Party supports tax cuts, believing that they should apply to everyone regardless of income level. On social issues, the Republican Party opposes abortion and same-sex marriage, and supports the right to bear arms. In foreign policy, the Republican Party tends to take a hard line and supports using military means to protect national interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-significance-of-trump-coming-to-power&#34;&gt;The significance of Trump coming to power
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s re-election as US President in 2024 marks the Republican Party’s dominance in American politics. Trump’s policy stances include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic policy: Trump advocates for stimulating economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation, particularly supporting the development of traditional manufacturing and energy industries. He also tends to adopt protectionist trade policies, renegotiating or withdrawing from existing trade agreements to protect American economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immigration policy: Trump plans to strengthen border security, restrict illegal immigration, and impose stricter scrutiny and restrictions on legal immigrants. He also supports limiting refugee and asylum applications in order to protect national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign policy: Trump tends to adopt unilateralism, emphasizing &amp;ldquo;America First,&amp;rdquo; reducing reliance on international organizations, reassessing relations with allies, and taking tougher diplomatic measures when necessary. He also plans to expand the production and use of fossil fuels and relax restrictions on environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second term for Trump could lead to significant adjustments in US domestic policy and have a profound impact on global politics and economics. His policies are likely to draw attention and reactions from the international community, particularly in areas such as trade, environment, and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-drop-institutional-operations-large-language-model-chain/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the Spring Festival, DeepSeek briefly became a hot topic, garnering widespread attention on social media in just a few days. This sudden surge in popularity was not only surprising but also triggered a chain reaction in the market. At the same time, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock experienced a sharp decline, raising concerns about its prospects among many investors. Some institutions conducted large-scale short selling during this period, suggesting everything pointed towards a &amp;ldquo;well-planned&amp;rdquo; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deepseeks-rapid-rise-to-prominence-quickly-becoming-the-focus-of-attention&#34;&gt;DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s rapid rise to prominence: quickly becoming the focus of attention
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is an AI-based tool focused on optimizing deep learning models, particularly in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and image generation. In the days leading up to the Spring Festival, this project suddenly garnered significant attention from a large number of investors and technical professionals. The performance of its team and the technological achievements demonstrated have sparked strong interest among many people. Discussions about DeepSeek dominate all topics in the tech circle, whether on developer communities or social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s sudden surge in popularity is not accidental. After analysis, many people suspect that some institutions may be involved behind the scenes. Especially after its rise, Nvidia’s stock price experienced a noticeable decline, and there are clearly factors driving this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nvidia-stock-plummets-the-force-behind-the-short-selling-operation&#34;&gt;Nvidia stock plummets: The force behind the short-selling operation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), has long been a key hardware provider for many large language models and AI computing. With the rapid development of the AI market, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock has consistently performed strongly and even become a favored investment target for many investors. However, with the rise of DeepSeek and the market’s high attention to its technology, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock experienced a sharp decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind this phenomenon, there may be involved the short-selling strategies of institutional investors. In recent years, with the popularization of AI technology, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock price has been highly driven up, and many investors began to believe that its stock price was overhyped. Especially after DeepSeek’s explosive success, some institutions may have gained substantial profits by shorting Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock. By seizing precise market timing and predicting the influence of DeepSeek, these institutions successfully profited from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;exploring-large-model-thinking-chains-from-results-to-process&#34;&gt;Exploring Large Model Thinking Chains: From &amp;ldquo;Results&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Process&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In traditional AI applications, many practitioners and investors focus more on the &amp;ldquo;results&amp;rdquo; of AI models—such as generated images, text, and other direct outputs. However, in discussions related to DeepSeek, an increasing number of people are realizing that the thinking chain hidden behind large models is the core content that deserves more attention. In the past, we could only see the results of model output, but now, we need to understand the underlying logic, algorithms, and how to optimize model performance by adjusting these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in thinking is, in essence, a deep reflection on AI research and application. Moving from simple black-box operations to truly understanding the internal workings of models has led many technical personnel and investors to begin reassessing the future direction of artificial intelligence. DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s popularity exemplifies this breakthrough application, prompting people to focus on the entire model construction and optimization process, rather than just the final output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s sudden surge in popularity, Nvidia’s stock plunge, and the short-selling operations of institutions behind the market – all this seems to be part of a carefully designed scheme. Through an in-depth understanding of large language model thinking chains, we can see that the application of AI technology is not merely a superficial accumulation of features but rather a deep exploration and optimization of the model&amp;rsquo;s internal logic. As technology advances, we may witness more innovative tools like DeepSeek, driving AI research and applications to higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon not only shows us the immense potential of AI technology but also prompts us to begin thinking about the commercial competition and capital operations behind the technology. The future trend of the market will be a continued focus of the interplay between technology and capital.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The End of the Era of Wild Capitalism: The League of Legends Esports Era Ends</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-era-league-of-legends-esports/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:19:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-era-league-of-legends-esports/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The esports industry has experienced rapid development over the past decade and a half, becoming an undeniable cultural phenomenon worldwide. In particular, MOBA games represented by 《英雄联盟》(League of Legends, abbreviated as LOL) not only provide players with competitive enjoyment but also inject powerful momentum for capital, driving the flourishing growth of various esports platforms and events. However, with the influx of capital and the rise of the pan-entertainment industry, all this has entered a stage of gradual decline. The rise and fall of Panda TV, and the competition between Douyu and Huya, mark the end of the “era of wild capitalism,” and the favorable conditions, location, and people for the esports industry seem to be undergoing changes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-investment&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Investment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early esports: from grassroots to professionalism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early esports industry had a relatively grassroots start, especially in the Chinese market. Many players participated in competitions for games like StarCraft and Dota, driven by their love of gaming. However, the true rise of esports began with the release and promotion of League of Legends. After League of Legends officially entered the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche circle into part of mainstream culture. Particularly starting in 2013, the LPL (Chinese professional league) steadily took shape, and League of Legends became the cornerstone of China&amp;rsquo;s esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital is pouring in wildly: The Rise of Panda TV and Esports Streaming Platforms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 was a turning point for the esports industry in China. The influx of capital transformed esports from purely competitive events into a much larger industrial chain. Panda TV, as one of its representatives, became a product of excess capital. Founded by Wang Sicong (one of the founders of Panda Live), it quickly rose to prominence, attracting a large audience and user base with its innovative content and massive investment. However, this was also a typical example of &amp;ldquo;barbaric&amp;rdquo; capital flowing into the market – the frantic pursuit of capital often lacks patience and long-term vision. While Panda TV&amp;rsquo;s financial and human resources resulted in certain achievements in the short term, it ultimately declared bankruptcy in 2019 due to management issues and over-reliance on capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live Streaming Platform Competition: A &amp;ldquo;Capital War&amp;rdquo; Between Douyu and Huya&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fall of Panda TV did not lead to a decline in the esports live streaming industry, but rather spurred the rise of platforms like Douyu and Huya. The two major live streaming platforms quickly became leaders in the esports industry, and their competition intensified. Douyu initially gained prominence through the broadcast of League of Legends professional matches and the signing of top streamers, establishing itself as a benchmark for esports live streaming. Huya, on the other hand, gradually narrowed the gap with Douyu by increasing investment in esports events and diversifying its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this process, capital once again played a significant role. Bilibili successfully went public in 2018, and Huya also conducted an IPO that same year. The rapid flow of capital led to high concentration within the industry and resulted in intense competition between platforms regarding anchors, copyrights, and other aspects, forming a &amp;ldquo;capital war.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-convergence-of-pan-entertainment-and-esports&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Convergence of Pan-Entertainment and Esports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trend of Pan-Entertainment: Capital Flows Towards Diversified Entertainment Projects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With renewed investment from capital in the esports industry, the content on esports platforms is gradually becoming more entertainment-focused. Esports anchors are no longer limited to match commentary and event broadcasts; they have begun to expand into various forms of entertainment such as singing, dancing, and interactive live streams. The platform&amp;rsquo;s content has become richer, gradually forming a content ecosystem centered around esports but incorporating diverse entertainment elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the trend of pervasive entertainment has also brought problems – esports&amp;rsquo; original focus on gaming culture is gradually being marginalized, replaced by a trend that prioritizes entertainment above all else. This trend has caused some viewers who were originally deeply passionate about esports culture to feel alienated, and capital has begun to shift its attention to other entertainment sectors. The excessive influx of capital and the pursuit of profit are causing the essence of the esports industry to gradually become blurred, and the core value concept centered on competition is beginning to weaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rise of the Pan-Entertainment Industry: Capital Retreat and Transformation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and other pan-entertainment industries have risen, capital has gradually shifted funds from esports to a broader range of entertainment content. In this process, giants like Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance no longer rely solely on esports projects as a source of profit but have increased their investment in areas such as film, music, and short videos. Particularly the rise of ByteDance, through the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin, has overshadowed esports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-the-break-in-continuity-of-the-league-of-legends-era-dividends-fade&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: The &amp;ldquo;Break in Continuity&amp;rdquo; of the League of Legends: Era Dividends Fade
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since League of Legends entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has almost become synonymous with the esports industry in China, creating countless professional players, teams, and events, and fostering a massive esports ecosystem. However, more than ten years have passed, and as a leading project in Chinese esports, League of Legends is entering a stage of “generational shift.” Especially in recent years, League of Legends&amp;rsquo; influence has been gradually declining, and even showing clear signs of recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layering of Player Groups
The most noticeable change is the generational shift in the player base. Initially, esports&amp;rsquo; rapid development relied on the support of a large number of young players, many of whom became professional players or viewers because of League of Legends. That generation of internet-addicted youth almost grew up under &amp;ldquo;demographic dividend,&amp;rdquo; immersed in the competitive appeal of LOL and thus driving the industry’s rapid expansion. However, as time passed, these players gradually matured, entered society, and began to shift towards other life and career paths. At the same time, the new generation of young players&amp;rsquo; interest in League of Legends is not as fervent as it used to be, and esports audiences are showing a clear age bias and declining interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.2 The &amp;ldquo;Weakness&amp;rdquo; of Game Content
League of Legends, after numerous updates and revisions, while still retaining a certain competitive appeal, has shown signs of struggling to innovate. Annual version updates, hero balance adjustments, and the introduction of new gameplay mechanics have seemingly failed to fundamentally address players&amp;rsquo; need for novelty. At the same time, the MOBA market is becoming saturated, and other game genres (such as Honor of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite) have rapidly risen in popularity, diverting a large number of players who previously played League of Legends. This competitive landscape has kept League of Legends perpetually in the role of a &amp;ldquo;follower.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-where-will-the-esports-industry-go-from-here&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Where will the esports industry go from here?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The esports industry is more like a skyscraper that sprung up seemingly out of nowhere. Excessive capital wanders within the internet sector, searching for the next trend, and esports has become one of their targets. Relying on China&amp;rsquo;s demographic dividend, the esports industry achieved tremendous success in a short period, but this success isn’t built on a solid foundation. Over-investment of capital, talent shortages, and weak game content – these issues are all hindering the healthy development of the esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before college, I didn&amp;rsquo;t play many games. League of Legends accompanied a generation’s growth. Having watched so many finals, as an outsider, comparing Chinese and Korean players, especially Faker, domestic players always feel hesitant and fearful during major tournaments. I understand the psychological pressure on players is immense, but this industry has been developing for over ten years. Psychological issues among players should have been prioritized by teams, but they haven’t been. The gameplay in China still relies on players&amp;rsquo; innate talent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>From Games to Family: Why We Gradually Disconnect from Virtual Worlds as We Grow Up</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:11:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thinking about when gaming is most enjoyable, is it sneaking away as a child to play Tank Battle, Super Mario, and Contra on the family TV, or secretly playing Age of Empires with my cousin on the family computer, or perhaps later in college, playing games like Devil May Cry and League of Legends with my roommates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you were a child, free from life&amp;rsquo;s worries, when you played, you really put your whole heart into it – that sense of immersion is something you can never find again as an adult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As times change and society progresses, we who were once active in the virtual world are gradually realizing that the gaming platform, once full of joy and competition, seems to be drifting away from our lives. The disconnection of game social links, accompanied by players gradually moving on, is not only due to technological advancements and the replacement of games themselves, but also because of a shift in the center of our lives. As we grow older, we become busy with marriage and having children, and the main focus of life gradually shifts from personal entertainment to family responsibilities. Today, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss the deeper reasons behind this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disappearance-of-gaming-socialization-a-tug-of-war-between-virtual-and-real-worlds&#34;&gt;The Disappearance of Gaming Socialization: A Tug-of-War Between Virtual and Real Worlds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people&amp;rsquo;s youth, games were more than just entertainment; they were a way to socialize. A popular online multiplayer game not only provided in-game challenges and competition but also connected players from all over the world, building virtual social circles. In that era, playing dungeons and team PKing with friends was part of life. Those late-night voice chats and sharing daily experiences became part of our memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as time passed, more and more players discovered that this virtual social experience didn&amp;rsquo;t have lasting appeal. With game updates and the diversification of social platforms, players gradually found more ways to interact outside of games. Friends made in games slowly disappeared from our lives, and many connections once active within the games were silently severed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;games-and-responsibility-a-shift-in-lifes-focus-after-adulthood&#34;&gt;Games and Responsibility: A Shift in Life&amp;rsquo;s Focus After Adulthood
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entering adulthood, the responsibilities in life gradually increase. Many young people once invested a lot of time in games, but with the start of their careers or living together with partners and starting families, these previously seemingly essential leisure activities begin to be squeezed by the responsibilities of real life. Marriage, having children, or even caring for parents – these major responsibilities in life force people to make choices about energy and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming has become a thing of the past, replaced by the prioritization of family life. Many young people who once &amp;ldquo;struggled&amp;rdquo; in games are gradually realizing that real-life is the most important subject. Especially after having children, the center of gravity in their lives completely shifts towards family, and gaming is gradually squeezed to the periphery of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-games-to-family-how-changes-in-life-affect-our-entertainment-habits&#34;&gt;From Games to Family: How Changes in Life Affect Our Entertainment Habits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our life experiences, family is one of the most important components. Once we enter family life, the allocation of time and energy becomes more specific and limited. To take care of children and spend time with their partners, many young parents find that they no longer have enough time to focus on the games they once loved. Sometimes, they even stop pursuing game updates and new features. Gradually, social platforms and offline interactions with friends and family become the preferred choice for socializing for more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we’ve completely abandoned entertainment, but rather chosen ways that are more suitable for our current life stage. Many friends who used to maintain connections through games may now choose other ways to stay in touch due to different life paths, such as family gatherings, meals together, and short trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;farewell-to-the-virtual-world-how-do-we-view-this-transition&#34;&gt;Farewell to the virtual world: How do we view this transition?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many who once immersed themselves in gaming, saying goodbye to game-related social interactions isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. After all, that virtual world that once brought us joy and a sense of accomplishment has long become part of our memories. However, farewell doesn’t mean severing ties completely; instead, as life changes, we begin to make different choices to balance our roles in real life. As we grow older, we transition from inexperienced youths into responsible adults, and while gaming still holds value, it can no longer be the main theme of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this shift also reflects an aspect of human adaptability—our ability to adjust our focus and lifestyle according to different stages. When responsibility and family become the core of life, gaming socialization is no longer a priority but rather a form of occasional leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-of-gaming-perhaps-it-will-usher-in-another-wave-of-sense-of-belonging&#34;&gt;The future of gaming: perhaps it will usher in another wave of &amp;ldquo;sense of belonging.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, with social development and technological advancements, the forms and content of games are also constantly evolving. For example, current online multiplayer games have begun to move towards more relaxed and flexible approaches, and some even emphasize family interaction and parent-child relationships in their design. In the future, we may see more game formats that better integrate into family life and provide players with healthier, more balanced social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as many people still feel nostalgia and passion when talking about &amp;ldquo;childhood games,&amp;rdquo; perhaps in the future, we too may unexpectedly pick up those old games again, entering that virtual world once more with new understanding and insights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-is-changing-but-love-remains&#34;&gt;Life is changing, but love remains
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s games or family, the changes in life always accompany our growth. In this process, we gradually realize that although the virtual world brings us endless joy and excitement, ultimately, we return to reality, to that warmest place – family. We don’t need to regret leaving games behind, because every stage of life has its own unique meaning. And these changes are precisely what make us become more complete individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>County-level Brahmin: Big Shots in Small Places</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:02:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, Teacher Da Bing has been very popular on Douyin. You often see accounts posting clips from her livestreams. During one livestream, a listener asked, &amp;ldquo;Teacher Da Bing, I want to sell my house in Xi&amp;rsquo;an and return to my hometown to lie flat?&amp;rdquo; Teacher Da Bing replied, &amp;ldquo;At your age, in your thirties, you can’t just lie flat. Your parents are on the road to aging, and your children haven&amp;rsquo;t settled down yet. Returning to your hometown, you&amp;rsquo;ll still need to deal with the &amp;lsquo;brahmin&amp;rsquo; within a small county town.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether the viewpoint is right or wrong, what does the word &amp;ldquo;Brahmin&amp;rdquo; mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;county-level-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-places&#34;&gt;County-Level Brahmins: &amp;ldquo;Big Shots&amp;rdquo; in Small Places
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many small county towns, people often talk about &amp;ldquo;county Brahmin&amp;rdquo; – their existence seems to symbolize a local society. They are not necessarily real religious figures or possess impressive titles, but rather seemingly ordinary yet influential individuals. They represent “power, status, and the right to speak” in a small place, symbolizing a certain stratum within that county town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-county-level-brahmin&#34;&gt;What is a &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmin&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand that &amp;ldquo;Brahmin&amp;rdquo; originally referred to the highest stratum of Indian society, representing wisdom, authority, and spiritual supremacy. However, in Chinese county towns, the term “county town Brahmin” does not have such a complex religious background; it is more of a metaphor for a social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmin&amp;rdquo; can be understood as some “cultural authorities” in the county town, such as teachers, doctors, local well-known merchants, and officials. Although their positions seem ordinary, they possess a relatively high social status in the comparatively closed environment of the county town, or rather, their opinions and actions have an influence that cannot be ignored locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-the-county-level-brahmin&#34;&gt;Who is the &amp;ldquo;County-Level Brahmin&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the county town, almost every industry has these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins.&amp;rdquo; They might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educators, especially some teachers with decades of experience in local areas, may not be graduates of prestigious universities, but they deeply understand how to establish credibility through knowledge and are widely respected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local government officials: deputy county-level mayors, section-level cadres, and others. They control certain resources and power; even though their positions may not be high, due to the limited scope of their authority, they can become the &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; of the locality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local &amp;ldquo;entrepreneurs&amp;rdquo;: Some of these are bosses in county-level towns, though their scale isn&amp;rsquo;t large, they hold a certain amount of wealth and have local influence. They might run one or two well-known small businesses and wield considerable influence within the town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people, though their status may not be prominent compared to the elites or officials in big cities, are practically equivalent to &amp;ldquo;cultural elders&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;power centers&amp;rdquo; within this small society of the county&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-the-status-of-county-level-brahmins-affect-society&#34;&gt;How does the status of &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; affect society?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the meaning of &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins,&amp;rdquo; we must consider the unique environment of a county. In this place, information doesn&amp;rsquo;t flow as quickly as in big cities, and social mobility is relatively fixed. These “Brahmins” often accumulate prestige, knowledge, and networks through long-term cultivation within the locality. They influence various aspects of local politics, economy, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural influence: In smaller places, especially where the education system may not be so developed and ordinary people have limited choices, local &amp;ldquo;cultural Brahmins&amp;rdquo; quietly shape the cultural atmosphere through knowledge imparted in classrooms, explanations in the media, and even the lessons they teach through their words and deeds in social situations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concentration of social resources: Due to the limited population and resources in county towns, these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; are often one of the main controllers of local resources. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s social welfare, policy implementation, or project approval, their influence is unavoidable. Their right to speak and make decisions allows them to occupy a place in local society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network structure of interpersonal relationships: In a relatively closed small society, personal connections are often crucial. These &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; control the flow of information and allocation of resources by establishing strong social networks, allowing them to play a decisive role at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-metaphor-behind-county-level-brahmin&#34;&gt;The Metaphor Behind &amp;ldquo;County-Level Brahmin&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; are often respected and revered, this &amp;ldquo;high-and-mighty&amp;rdquo; status is not without its problems. In modern society, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see that many &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; in county towns may lack genuine ability and innovative spirit, instead maintaining their position through hereditary relationships and resource monopolies. With the development of informatization, the power of these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; is gradually being broken down, and new social mobility is beginning to impact the appearance of small counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &amp;ldquo;County-Level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; is a fascinating social phenomenon that reflects the power and cultural structures within local societies. Although their “power” may not directly threaten national governance, they are undoubtedly important figures within their localities. In this era of rapid information flow and accelerating social change, these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; in county towns may be facing unprecedented challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It never would have occurred to me to write this piece. I was just curious about what &lt;code&gt;Brahmin&lt;/code&gt; meant, so I tossed it to &lt;code&gt;kimi&lt;/code&gt;, and the result was quite amusing. I could see that the web search had already produced a result, but it instantly changed to display related content unavailable. So I wondered if this word had some special meaning, and then I passed it on to &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/code&gt;, which resulted in this article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Art of Balancing Bank Marketing Strategies with Personal Financial Management</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</link>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, home renovation projects have significantly increased our daily expenses. We usually use credit cards and pay them off within the billing cycle. Although we have enough cash on hand, we prefer to keep it in money market funds to earn some extra interest income. At the same time, to ensure financial stability, we’ve set up automatic payments so that credit card bills can be paid on time when they are due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-status-deposits-increasing-loans-decreasing&#34;&gt;Bank status: Deposits increasing, loans decreasing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst growing economic uncertainty, people are more inclined to save rather than consume or invest. This leads to an increase in bank deposits but also means banks need to pay higher interest rates to depositors. On the other hand, reduced consumption and investment activities lead to lower loan demand, making it difficult for banks to generate interest income through lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attract and retain customers, banks are forced to offer more competitive deposit rates, which further compresses their net interest margin. At the same time, in order to stimulate economic growth and consumption, the central bank may adopt a policy of lowering benchmark interest rates, which will also affect lending rates and subsequently impact banks&amp;rsquo; profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-marketing-strategies-cultivating-user-habits&#34;&gt;Bank marketing strategies: Cultivating user habits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repayment time is approaching soon. First, Bank of Communications contacted me, offering a one-year installment service with no interest charges. Shortly after that, China Merchants Bank also provided a discount on installment interest at 25%, resulting in an annualized interest rate of just 1.9%. Faced with these offers, I chose to accept the installment services from both banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that banks are truly sparing no effort to cultivate user habits. According to the definition of a bank&amp;rsquo;s clientele, I should be considered a valuable customer. In the current context of difficult loan disbursement for banks, by cultivating my installment mindset, they are essentially preparing for potential future financial difficulties I may encounter, at which point they will be able to earn more interest income from me. After all, it is well known that credit card bill interest rates are not low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks increase credit card usage and build a positive image by offering free installment services and low-interest installment promotions. This shift in strategy demonstrates the bank&amp;rsquo;s rapid response to market changes and deep understanding of customer needs. In this way, banks not only solve the problem of difficult loan disbursement but also lay the groundwork for future profits—&lt;strong&gt;profitability isn’t just about the present; it requires a long-term perspective.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-personal-financial-management&#34;&gt;The importance of personal financial management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although bank installment offers may sound tempting, as users, we should be aware of the risks of over-relying on credit card installments. We should fully consider our repayment ability and future financial needs to avoid falling into long-term debt due to short-term financial convenience. The key to personal financial management lies in balancing current needs with future planning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The multifaceted nature of games: a convergence of psychological development and social entertainment</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 15:07:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, gaming is no longer just a simple form of entertainment but has become an indispensable part of people’s daily lives. From a psychological perspective, games play different roles in the psychological development of people at different ages and are also closely linked to social recreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-state&#34;&gt;Mental state
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games provide young people with a low-cost environment for experimentation and exploration, as they are at a stage of exploring themselves and establishing their identity. Through games, they can try on different roles and lives, satisfying their curiosity and desire to explore. As they get older, however, personal interests and values gradually stabilize, and games may no longer align with their life goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes&#34;&gt;Social attributes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, gaming has become part of social activity, especially for young people. They make friends and build social networks through games; gaming serves as a bridge for socializing. However, as people age, their social circles gradually stabilize, and social needs may be met through other more mature means, diminishing the role of gaming in socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attribute-taking-a-girl-out&#34;&gt;Social attribute: Taking a girl out
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, due to a lack of relationship education, parents often only emphasize studying well during childhood and then immediately push you into dating after graduation—this is a very common phenomenon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of busy studies, work, or a lack of social skills, they haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to establish stable emotional relationships in real life, leading to feelings of loneliness and a desire for attention. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Carrying&amp;rdquo; behavior in games provides an outlet for this longing; by helping and protecting female players, they experience the feeling of being needed and valued, achieving emotional fulfillment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the game&amp;rsquo;s interactive rules are clear and the environment is controllable. Compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real life, games offer a sense of certainty and security, reducing fear of unpredictability in real-world interactions. However, long-term reliance on virtual gratification within games may affect their ability to establish and maintain healthy emotional relationships in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reality-pressure&#34;&gt;Reality pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game provides a virtual world where players can temporarily escape the stress, challenges, or unpleasant emotions of reality. This is especially true for young people facing academic pressure, family problems, or interpersonal relationship challenges; gaming may become a way for them to seek comfort and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are typically designed to give players a sense of accomplishment and recognition when they complete tasks, level up, or defeat opponents. Young people may become addicted to games because they can gain a feeling of being appreciated and recognized in the game, which they may lack in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-getting-older-they-dont-like-playing-anymore&#34;&gt;After getting older, they don&amp;rsquo;t like playing anymore
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young, individuals face relatively fewer social responsibilities and pressures, allowing more time and energy to be devoted to games. As they enter the workforce, start families, and other social responsibilities increase, time and energy become more valuable, and gaming may be seen as a time-consuming activity rather than a preferred leisure choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, their cognitive abilities and interests change. What might appeal to someone in their youth—fast-paced action games with flashy graphics—may later give way to a preference for strategic, story-driven, or deeply engaging games. If the market cannot meet these evolving needs, interest will naturally decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Game psychology: Competitive gaming</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-esports/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 10:26:22 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-esports/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Games that require spending money—we don&amp;rsquo;t discuss this here. Within the gaming community, they are commonly called &amp;ldquo;money warriors.&amp;rdquo; It doesn’t require understanding game mechanics, just a substantial wallet. Their enjoyment comes from being surrounded by subordinates and the thrill of “city-destroying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitive games with a wide audience, such as League of Legends, Dota, Honor of Kings, and PlayerUnknown&amp;rsquo;s Battlegrounds, have world-building that is fully established, and their esports scenes are already in a virtuous cycle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In game design, psychology is indeed a key area, and social psychology is particularly important. Understanding people&amp;rsquo;s behavior, needs, and motivations can help design more engaging game experiences. Regarding the relationship between &amp;ldquo;showing off&amp;rdquo; and social psychology, we can look at it from the following perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social recognition: People often seek to establish a sense of belonging within social groups. In games, if the design allows players to feel exceptional in some way and attract the attention of other players, it can increase their social recognition. This may manifest as showing off skills or displaying earned rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social competition: Some games incorporate elements of social competition, encouraging players to showcase their achievements on social networks. This can be achieved through leaderboards, achievement systems, or multiplayer battles. Such design stimulates a competitive psychology among players and may lead some players to perform better in order to gain social recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-presentation: Some games allow players to express themselves through customizing characters, virtual items, and other means. This self-presentation is not just about showing off; it can also be a way of expressing individuality and engaging in social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teamwork: Some games emphasize teamwork, achieving game objectives through social interaction. In such situations, showing off may not be encouraged, but rather team collaboration and mutual support are stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological reward systems: Game design can adopt psychological reward systems to stimulate players&amp;rsquo; positive social behaviors. For example, giving players rewards or privileges to encourage them to actively participate in social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, social psychology in game design can be used to shape interactions and social experiences among players. While showing off behavior may exist in certain situations, game designers typically work to balance this behavior to ensure a positive and enjoyable gaming experience for all players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write as I think, there&amp;rsquo;s no complete outline, so it&amp;rsquo;s a little messy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author often plays League of Legends, which is a shared memory of our generation. Most parents don&amp;rsquo;t like their children playing games because they haven’t deeply understood or experienced this type of game. This is also related to the game design; each game is a new beginning. For many children, when they play, they don&amp;rsquo;t bring too much thought into it, but rather explore on their own. In this mode, winning or losing depends more on the child’s innate gaming talent. Based on my personal experience, a considerable number of players fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost isn&amp;rsquo;t money, it&amp;rsquo;s time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game also features an entertainment mode to cater to the needs of casual players&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, League of Legends is more about fulfilling a &amp;ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&amp;rdquo; dream. You start with nothing, and through your understanding, last-hitting, farming, spending resources, controlling vision, setting traps for the enemy – it&amp;rsquo;s more about using your brain than having exceptional gaming talent, and you can still have a lot of fun. The feeling of being in control of everything, the joy of turning around a losing game. And there are also many &amp;ldquo;spectator players&amp;rdquo; who don’t play the game anymore, but still watch the matches during Worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s unavoidable to mention &lt;code&gt;game time&lt;/code&gt;. This isn&amp;rsquo;t referring to the duration of a single game, but rather when you log in – weekend afternoons, or between 7 pm and 10 pm on weeknights. You’ll find that most communication with teammates goes smoothly; your signals are understood, and you receive responses. If you switch to other times, like playing through the night, you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to encounter &lt;code&gt;internet addicts&lt;/code&gt;. In good situations, nothing happens. When things go badly, they can insult your whole family, and you can feel that sense of resentment radiating from the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the IT industry, so I’ve had a lot of exposure to games and played many different types. When it comes to competitive games, I always rely on strategy rather than reaction speed. My natural aptitude is there, but compared to professionals or younger players, my reactions are slower. I&amp;rsquo;m used to playing with groups and taking control of the team’s direction. I started playing back when I was studying, playing alongside the older members of a guild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gaming environment now is quite restless, lacking the purity of before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After moving up in grade, playing high-level matches is really tiring. It requires intense concentration throughout the entire game, constantly thinking about your opponent&amp;rsquo;s plans and how to counter their setups – it’s the kind of experience where you don’t want to continue after finishing a match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, being really good at gaming isn&amp;rsquo;t that useful if you don’t pursue it as a profession; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t change your life trajectory. It can be used for socializing, but it can’t provide a livelihood or allow you to establish yourself in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-player games and online games are two different types of games, with significant differences in gameplay, experience, and technology. Here are some key aspects to understand the distinctions between single-player and online games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connection method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standalone games (Offline/Single-player): These games are played alone on a local device and do not require an internet connection. Players can enjoy the gaming experience without network connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These games typically require an internet connection because players need to interact with each other in real time. Online games can be cooperative or competitive, involving online socializing and competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Player interaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single-player games: Players primarily interact with in-game artificial intelligence, pre-set missions, or adversarial elements. The gaming experience is typically more personalized and influenced by the game&amp;rsquo;s design and storyline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online games: Players can interact with other real players from around the world. This may include cooperating to complete quests, competing against or challenging each other, and social elements such as chat, guild systems, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game design and content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single-player games: Game design focuses on providing a complete and independent storyline and gaming experience. The game content is typically pre-designed, and players explore, solve puzzles, or engage in combat within the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online games: Game design needs to consider real-time interaction and competition or collaboration between players. The game content may be more dynamic, including regular updates, online events, and social interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical Requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standalone games typically run offline and have relatively low requirements for device performance and internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online games require a strong internet connection and have high demands on server and network performance to ensure smooth real-time interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standalone games typically use a one-time purchase or download business model, allowing players to fully play the game on their local device after purchasing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online games may adopt various business models such as free play, advertising, in-game item purchases, or subscriptions to maintain server operations and continuously update game content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these differences helps players clarify their preferences when choosing a game and allows game designers to better meet player expectations&lt;/p&gt;</description>
