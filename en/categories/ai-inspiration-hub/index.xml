        <description>&lt;p&gt;China’s population control policies, while limiting growth and curbing family-style development, have disrupted traditional social structures, suppressed the expansion of family-owned businesses and political dynasty power, presenting a unique case compared to Korean conglomerates and Indian family monopolies. Now that birth restrictions are being relaxed, despite facing challenges such as low fertility rates, it’s crucial to be wary of new monopoly risks, requiring multiple parties to seek balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;one-the-tension-between-population-control-and-family-style-development&#34;&gt;One: The Tension Between Population Control and Family-Style Development
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family planning policy, implemented in China for nearly forty years as a basic national strategy, has achieved significant direct results. Data shows that from 1978 to 2007, China’s natural population growth rate fell from 12‰ to 5.2‰, resulting in a reduction of over 40 million people, and the country&amp;rsquo;s share of the world’s population decreased from 22.2% to 20.1%. This sharp deceleration in population growth profoundly reshaped China’s social family structure. Taking family-owned enterprises as an example, after the implementation of the family planning policy, the number of children born by business owners declined significantly: before the policy, the proportion of those having three or more children was 40.63%, and after the policy it plummeted to 18.46%, the proportion of single sons born increased from 6.25% to 32.31%. This structural change directly reduced the range of potential internal successors for family-owned enterprises, objectively suppressing their generational expansion capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;one-the-tension-between-population-control-and-familial-development&#34;&gt;One: The Tension Between Population Control and Familial Development
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing Korea and India reveals significant differences. While Korea did not implement strict birth control measures, fertility rates have remained low for a long time (0.7 in 2023), the chaebols still firmly control the nation’s economic lifeline through cross-shareholdings and tax avoidance strategies like inheritance taxes. The top five chaebols account for over 50% of Korea&amp;rsquo;s GDP, with Samsung Group alone contributing 20%. India presents a contrasting picture: 79% of its economic output is contributed by family-owned businesses, with six major conglomerates controlling key sectors such as telecommunications and steel, and the top 20 enterprises earning 80% of national corporate profits. The core difference lies in the fact that China’s birth control policies limited family sizes, thereby weakening the human resources base for chaebol expansion at its source.  Due to different policy environments, familial power has continued to penetrate economic sectors in Korea and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-monopoly-restraint-and-social-structural-transformation&#34;&gt;II. Monopoly Restraint and Social Structural Transformation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the economic sector is particularly evident in its suppression of monopolistic phenomena. Due to declining birth rates, Chinese family businesses have struggled to form conglomerates similar to those in South Korea and Japan. Taking South Korea as an example, chaebols maintained their control through “circular capital” investments, with the Samsung family holding only 2% of the group’s shares while controlling the entire operation through complex equity structures. Conversely, in China, family businesses following the family planning policy generally faced difficulties in “passing down the business to one’s children,” often necessitating the introduction of professional managers or implementing equity diversification reforms. According to a湃新闻 (Papare News) study, the proportion of female successors in family-owned enterprises after the family planning policy increased from 13.85% to 34.21%, and the educational attainment of these successors significantly improved, with the percentage of undergraduates rising from 43.75% to 98.46%. This transition, while not completely eliminating family control, significantly reduced the possibility of a single family monopolizing the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the social structure level, the population planning policy accelerated the breakdown of traditional family core patterns. China’s average household size decreased from 4.41 people/household in 1982 to 2.62 people/household in 2020, with smaller families weakening the family&amp;rsquo;s functions in areas such as economics, education, and social support. In contrast, India maintains an average family size of around 4 people, with the caste system deeply intertwined with family power, leading to low social mobility. China’s transformation of its family structure created space for individualism; in 2023, China had 240 million single adult citizens, and a trend of “one-person economy” emerged in the consumer market, further diminishing the influence of family economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;three-decentralization-of-power-in-the-political-sphere&#34;&gt;Three. Decentralization of Power in the Political Sphere
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the political landscape has been profound. Traditionally, family power structures had infiltrated grassroots politics through bloodlines and kinship relationships. For example, in Henan’s Xinye County, 161 political families almost controlled all government departments, with 20% of deputy-level and above officials belonging to “officer’s children.” However, after the implementation of the family planning policy, shrinking family sizes limited the expansion of family networks. Research from Peking University showed that the number of offspring of officials decreased following family planning, and the complexity of family political networks significantly declined. Furthermore, the policy-driven increase in education (the average years of education increased from 5.2 years in 1982 to 10.9 years in 2023) promoted social mobility, weakening the monopoly of family power over political resources. Comparing Korea and India, the deep entanglement between Korean conglomerates (like Samsung Group executives and government corruption) and India’s caste-based hereditary political lineage highlights the uniqueness of Chinese policy. China, through its population control policies, objectively reduced the possibility of power succession. While familial phenomena still exist within county-level politics, the overall trend is towards a decentralization of power structures. During the 2025 National People&amp;rsquo;s Congress (NPC) session, an NPC delegate proposed renaming “The Population and Family Planning Law” to “The Population and Reproduction Law,” fully opening up birth limits – a move that could further influence the evolution of future political ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;four-challenges-and-opportunities-following-policy-adjustments&#34;&gt;Four. Challenges and Opportunities Following Policy Adjustments
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the 2016 comprehensive two-child policy and the 2021 three-child policy marked a significant shift in China’s birth policies. However, the policy effects were limited: births in 2022 totaled only 1.18, far below the replacement level (2.1). The relaxation of birth restrictions had a dual impact on family-owned businesses: on one hand, some entrepreneurs may strengthen family succession capabilities through multiple children, such as Zong Qinghui, the daughter of Wahaha Group founder Zong Qunhui, who took over as the sole heir; on the other hand, high childcare costs (the average cost of raising a child to 18 years old in first-tier cities reaches 1 million yuan) and declining fertility intentions among professional women limited the expansion of family size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the economic sphere, relaxing birth restrictions may give rise to new monopoly forms. The three-child policy has accelerated the concentration of the infant care and childcare industries, with the market size for infant care expected to reach 1621 in 2025. - 300 million yuan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading enterprises are utilizing mergers and acquisitions to integrate smaller manufacturers, resulting in a CR5 market concentration exceeding 55%. This increase in concentration may bring about efficiency gains, but it also warrants vigilance against new monopoly risks. The government needs to strike a balance between encouraging childbirth and preventing market consolidation, such as strengthening regulation through antitrust laws while providing childcare subsidies (e.g., Hangzhou’s three-child families receiving RMB 3,000 per month in milk powder allowances) to alleviate household burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the political sphere, relaxing birth restrictions could have subtle impacts on family power structures. While it is unlikely to restore traditional family political networks in the short term, over the long term, larger families may form new influence within grassroots politics. Therefore, refining personnel selection mechanisms and strengthening oversight (such as establishing a nepotism avoidance system for officials) remains crucial in preventing hereditary power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;five-international-mirroring-and-future-outlook&#34;&gt;Five. International Mirroring and Future Outlook
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiences of South Korea and India demonstrate that the ebb and flow of family power is closely linked to policy orientations. South Korea achieved economic takeoff by supporting conglomerates, but at the cost of social inequality; India’s failure to implement effective policies to curb family monopolies has exacerbated wealth disparity. China&amp;rsquo;s population control policy effectively controlled population growth while objectively suppressing the expansion of family power, but it also resulted in accelerated aging and labor shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, China needs to find a new balance between population policy and socio-economic development. On one hand, through fertility support policies (such as extending maternity leave and building universal childcare institutions) increase birth rates; on the other hand, strengthen antitrust enforcement to prevent family businesses from forming new monopolies through capital operations. In the political sphere, further progress must be made in grassroots democratic construction, with enhanced oversight mechanisms to ensure transparency in governance. Ultimately, the family planning policy served as a key driver of social transformation in China; its impact extended far beyond population issues. It reshaped family structures, economic models, and the political landscape, providing a path for China to avoid falling into the trap of family monopolies like those seen in Korea and India. With the adjustment of the policy, balancing efficiency with equity, freedom with order, will remain a long-term challenge facing China in its new demographic context.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trade war abruptly called a pause</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 19:07:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of trade war tariffs in 2025 presented a “escalation – counter-repressive measures – negotiations” cycle, with the US-China rivalry shifting from tariff confrontation to competition over rules. Despite short-term easing that alleviated market pressure, long-term uncertainty persists, and it’s crucial to monitor WTO rulings, supply chain adjustments, and geopolitical shifts&amp;rsquo; sustained impact on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don’t earn money beyond their own perception; the stock market crash triggered by the launch of the trade war this year has largely recovered, but countless retail investors have been buried along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2025 Trade War Tariff Timeline Overview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a timeline of the trade war tariff events, combining key events involving the US and China, and other countries, illustrating the dynamic evolution of tariff policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-april-2025-comprehensive-upgrade-and-countermeasures-on-tariffs&#34;&gt;I. April 2025: Comprehensive Upgrade and Countermeasures on Tariffs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Tariff Measures Against China&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2nd:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration signed Executive Order No. 14257, announcing the imposition of a 34% “retaliatory tariff” on goods shipped from China to the U.S., covering products originating in Hong Kong and Macao.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 8th:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States further increased the “retaliatory tariff” rate on Chinese goods from 34% to 84%, and signed Executive Orders No. 14259 and 14266, imposing tariffs on additional products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 10th:&lt;/strong&gt; The White House amended the executive order, increasing the total tariff amount against China to 145%, and raising the tariff rate on small packages (such as goods priced below $800 from 90% to 120%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s Countermeasures&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 4th:&lt;/strong&gt; China announced the imposition of a 34% tariff on all goods originating in the United States, covering sectors such as agricultural products, automobiles, and energy. - &lt;strong&gt;April 10th&lt;/strong&gt;: China will retaliate against the tariff rate increase from 34% to 84%, in sync with the US side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 12th&lt;/strong&gt;: China cancels the additional tariffs imposed on U.S. goods by 91% (corresponding to part of the cancellation by the US side) and suspends the implementation of 24% tariffs for 90 days, retaining 10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-april-2025-comprehensive-tariff-upgrade-and-countermeasures&#34;&gt;I. April 2025: Comprehensive Tariff Upgrade and Countermeasures
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariff Games Involving Other Countries&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US-Canada Trade War:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States imposes 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum products, and Canada retaliates by taxing goods worth $298 billion from the US, as well as filing a WTO dispute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EU &amp;amp; Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; The EU imposes maximum 25% tariffs on US goods, while Japan expresses concern over auto tariffs imposed by the US, calling the trade war “harming both sides.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-may-2025-geneva-talks-and-tariff-de-escalation&#34;&gt;II. May 2025: Geneva Talks and Tariff De-escalation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US-China High-Level Trade Talks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 10-11:&lt;/strong&gt; The US and China held a 16-hour meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, reaching the “Joint Statement on the US-China Economic Talks.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 12:&lt;/strong&gt; Both sides announced a suspension of some tariffs:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United States paused its 24% tariff on Chinese goods (90 days), retaining 10%, and rescinded the additional tariffs imposed on April 8th and 9th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China simultaneously suspended its 24% retaliatory tariffs, retaining 10%, and lifted non-tariff measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishment of a Consultation Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Both sides agreed to hold regular trade consultations in China, the United States, or a third country, focusing on tariff reduction and rulemaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Impact and Policy Adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Domestic Pressure:&lt;/strong&gt; High tariffs led to the closure of small and medium-sized enterprises (such as Amazon sellers forced to close due to tariff surges) and rising inflation expectations (core PCE is expected to rise to 3…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-other-key-events-and-long-term-impacts&#34;&gt;III. Other Key Events and Long-Term Impacts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WTO and Multilateral Responses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canada and China both lodged WTO disputes against the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and “retaliatory tariffs,” alleging violations of non-discrimination principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTO Director-General Azevedo warned that U.S. tariffs could cause a 1% contraction in global trade volumes by 2025, exacerbating difficulties for developing countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exemption Lists and Industry Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Excluded Goods:&lt;/strong&gt; A 37-page list covering strategic materials such as rare earths, graphite, and medical CT balls exposed supply chain vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto Tariffs:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imported automobiles, leading to an estimated 2% decline in global auto production and a 9% reduction in North American output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political and Strategic Maneuvering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration attempted to reshape the international trade order through “retaliatory tariffs,” but was criticized as unilateral bullying, triggering backlash from allies (such as the EU and Japan).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;td&gt;April 10th&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;China retaliates by imposing a 34% tariff, later raised to 84%; the US adjusts tariffs to 145%.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;

&lt;td&gt;April 12th&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The United States waived some goods (such as technology products), China lifted 91% of the counter-tariffs.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;May 10-11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;US-China talks in Geneva, reaching a joint statement agreeing to suspend tariffs of 24% (for 90 days).&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Term Relief and Long-Term Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; The suspension of US-China tariffs sent positive signals, but structural issues (such as high technology and energy) remain, with mid-term elections or policy continuity impacting the outlook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Supply Chain Restructuring:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies are accelerating adjustments to their supply chains, with Mexico and Southeast Asia benefiting from “nearshoring,” but rising costs may dampen recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilateral Mechanism Dilemmas:&lt;/strong&gt; The WTO dispute resolution mechanism is constrained, regional trade agreements (such as the US-UK agreement) are emerging as alternative options, but this could exacerbate fragmentation.&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;2020-2025 Years: A Significant Reduction in Teacher Recruitment Trends in Jiangxi Province – Special Post Recruitment Numbers Plummeted from 6,617 to 32 (a decrease of 99.5%), while National Personnel Teachers decreased from 11,324 to 2,146 (a decrease of 81.1%). The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, Mathematics, and English) remained stable but declined in total volume; while the proportions of disciplines such as music, art, and physical education increased, the absolute numbers were limited (e.g., in 2025, they only recruited 2 people each). Policy-driven “One Out, One In” personnel adjustments tightened recruitment, with teacher resources leaning towards vocational training and remote areas; traditional primary and secondary school positions significantly reduced, and some subjects planned for 2025 were set to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-data-description&#34;&gt;III. Data Description
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Source&lt;/strong&gt;: Recruitment announcements and official statistics from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education and the Department of Human Resources and Social Security over the past years (actual recruitment numbers for 2020-2024, planned numbers for 2025).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject Categories&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special Post Teachers focus on subjects at rural primary education stages; only a small number of main subject positions are retained in 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Personnel Teachers cover all academic levels and have a more comprehensive curriculum, including preschool education and special education (due to data not being segmented, these were not listed separately).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trend Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharp Decline in Total Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;: The recruitment quota for Special Post Teachers decreased by 99.5% compared to 2020 in 2025, and the recruitment quota for National Personnel Teachers decreased by 81.1%, reflecting changes in population structure and adjustments in educational resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot vs. Cold Subjects&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of main subjects (Chinese, Mathematics, English) remained stable but declined year on year in terms of recruitment numbers. - The proportion of disciplines such as Audio-Visual Arts, Information Technology, etc., is rising, but the absolute number remains limited (e.g., only 2 people recruited in Audio-Visual Arts each year by 2025).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some subjects (such as English) are facing suspensions due to declining student numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Background:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightening of Enrollment:&lt;/strong&gt; Implementing a “withdraw one, fill one” policy, strictly controlling the addition of new positions, with external positions accounting for 68.6% in 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Adjustment:&lt;/strong&gt; Teacher resources are leaning towards vocational education and remote areas, while recruitment in traditional primary and secondary schools has significantly decreased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The “Tiangong” (Heavenly Palace) incident in medical education and the Butterfly Effect of Dong Xi Ying’s case</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-and-the-butterfly-effect-of-dong-xiying-incident/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 01:08:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-and-the-butterfly-effect-of-dong-xiying-incident/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Beijing Children’s Hospital “4+4” project (4 years non-medical bachelor&amp;rsquo;s + 4 years medical doctorate) focuses on interdisciplinary elite cultivation. The exposure of Dong Xi Ying’s case in 2025 revealed her use of family background (medical/scientific research lineage) to gain entry into the program, raising concerns about the ambiguity of her qualifications, allegations of plagiarism in her dissertation, and exposing contradictions between its elite recruitment model and fairness, as well as ongoing debates regarding shortened study durations and internship training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompts&#34;&gt;Prompts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog: Harmony 4+4 Origin and Development, Core: A Corner of Tian Gong, Seen by Mortals, Dong Xiaojie&amp;rsquo;s Family Background, Normal Medical Doctor Cannot Graduate in Eight Years, Dong Xiaojie’s Family Background &amp;amp; Educational Background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harmony-44-deconstructing-medical-educations-tian-gong&#34;&gt;Harmony 4+4: Deconstructing Medical Education&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Tian Gong&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “4+4” project at the Beijing Union Medical College, since its launch in 2018, has been viewed as China’s “Tian Gong” – or celestial palace – in medical education. This project, designed to mimic the American medical education system, adopted the philosophy of “cultivating multidisciplinary backgrounds, nurturing love for medicine, and attracting outstanding talents from across the nation.” It aimed to create a rift within traditional Chinese medical education by: &lt;strong&gt;replacing the traditional 5+3+3 (five-year bachelor’s degree + three-year master’s degree + three-year doctoral degree) model with a four-year non-medical undergraduate program plus a four-year medical doctorate training.&lt;/strong&gt; This was intended to cultivate cross-disciplinary leadership talent in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project&amp;rsquo;s “Tian Gong” attributes are reflected across three dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elite Recruitment:&lt;/strong&gt; Early requirements stipulated that applicants must come from QS/Times/US News ranked top 50 universities or US News’s top 10 liberal arts colleges (such as Barnard College), later relaxed to the top 100, but still requiring a GPA of 3.6 or being within the top 30% of their class. &lt;strong&gt;Internationalization of Curriculum Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopting an organ-system integration curriculum in the American style, PBL (Problem-Based Learning) methodology, students must complete core courses such as anatomy and pathology within 4 years, and participate in clinical internships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controversy Regarding Export Quality:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite a slightly lower pass rate for practitioners’ examinations (95.2%) compared to the traditional eight-year program (98.5%), graduates predominantly enter affiliated hospitals, and their career development shows no significant difference from traditional pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dong-xiying-incident-a-celestial-realm-crack-revealed-by-ordinary-eyes&#34;&gt;Dong Xiying Incident: A &amp;ldquo;Celestial Realm&amp;rdquo; Crack Revealed by Ordinary Eyes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, the extramarital affair involving Xiao Fei, a thoracic surgeon at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, triggered scrutiny of the “4+4 Project” of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital of Capital Medical University, commonly known as “Covelong 4+4.” The background of Dong Xiying, the key figure involved, sparked three major questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambiguity Regarding Educational Background:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Over Undergraduate Institution:&lt;/strong&gt; Dong Xiying claimed to have graduated from Columbia University, but she actually attended Barnard College (ranked 14th in US News &amp;amp; World Report for liberal arts colleges in 2025). Although the college met Covelong’s requirement of “top 20 liberal arts colleges,” her diploma simultaneously listed &amp;ldquo;Barnard College&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Columbia University,&amp;rdquo; which could easily be misinterpreted as Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s main campus in the domestic recruitment market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Over Professional Field:&lt;/strong&gt; An economics undergraduate degree combined with a clinical medicine doctorate, while aligning with the 4+4 project’s positioning of “multi-disciplinary background,” has been questioned for lacking a foundation in pre-clinical medical courses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dong-xi-ying-incident-peering-through-the-heavenly-palace-crack--a-glimpse-for-ordinary-people&#34;&gt;Dong Xi Ying Incident: Peering Through the &amp;ldquo;Heavenly Palace&amp;rdquo; Crack – A Glimpse for Ordinary People
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Family Background:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academic Resource Monopoly:&lt;/strong&gt; Her father was the secretary of the China Metallurgical and Research Bureau Construction Institute, her mother was a deputy director of the North Medical University Engineering Technology Research Institute, and her grandfather was an academician in the field of medical imaging. Her paternal grandparents were doctoral supervisors (Doyens) at North Medical University in the field of materials. This “medicine + research + university” composite family background provided implicit resources such as recommendation letters (requiring recommendations from two biomedical associate professors) and research collaborations (such as North Medical University patents).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career Path Leaps:&lt;/strong&gt; She transitioned from cardiac surgery during residency to urology, with research spanning orthopedics, gastroenterology, radiology, and other fields. This was questioned as “paved road” due to the rapid changes in her career path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exaggerated Dispute Over Study Duration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasonableness of Time Compression:&lt;/strong&gt; Traditional medical doctorates require 11 years (5+3+3), while the 4+4 program compressed the time to 8 years. Despite Harmony emphasizing “curriculum integration” and “early clinical exposure,” some physicians pointed out that its clinical internship period (12 months) is still less than the traditional eight-year program (18 months), potentially impacting skill accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Controversy Regarding CCT Reduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Some CCT bases allowing 4+4 graduates to waive one year of CCT are being questioned for undermining industry fairness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-medical-education-quagmire-behind-the-controversy&#34;&gt;The Medical Education Quagmire Behind the Controversy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dong Xiying incident reflects deep contradictions within Chinese medical education:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict between Elitism and Equity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “application-assessment” system of the 4+4 program is essentially a transplantation of the American medical school model, but China lacks standardized exams like MCAT, relying instead on subjective evaluations such as recommendations and research experience, which are significantly influenced by family background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data shows that among graduates of the 4+4 program in 2023, 30% came from Qingbei Fuzhou (the top universities), and 25% from overseas prestigious schools. The influence of family background on applications is significant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reality of Curriculum Reform:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cost of Time Compression:&lt;/strong&gt; 4+4 students produce significantly fewer research outputs (such as the number of publications) than traditional eight-year programs, and are accused of “prioritizing clinical work over research.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divergence in Industry Recognition:&lt;/strong&gt; Three-tier hospitals prioritize the reputation of Covance (the name of the top university), while基层医院 (jīchéng yīyuàn - primary hospitals) maintain a cautious attitude towards the clinical abilities of 4+4 graduates. - &lt;strong&gt;The Confusion Surrounding the International Integration of Medical Education&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US 4+4 model requires passing the MCAT exam and completing a 3-7 year residency, while China’s 4+4 programs have simplified the entry and residency stages, leading to “form resembling but not truly similar.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data from the Ministry of Education shows that in 2024, 4+4 programs accounted for less than 5% of national medical doctorate admissions, and their large-scale promotion still faces resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-reconstructing-the-tiangong-order-of-medical-education&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Reconstructing the &amp;ldquo;Tiangong&amp;rdquo; Order of Medical Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding the CoHo 4+4 project fundamentally represents a clash between elite education and public expectations. When a corner of the “Tiangong” (Heavenly Palace) was glimpsed by mortals, it exposed not just isolated instances of flaws, but deeper contradictions within the entire medical education system. Future reforms must focus on three levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparent Selection Mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; Introduce standardized exams (such as a Chinese version of MCAT) to reduce the influence of subjective factors like letters of recommendation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extend Clinical Training Cycle:&lt;/strong&gt; Restore the clinical training cycle for 4+4 graduates to 3 years, ensuring that clinical competence is achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen Process Oversight:&lt;/strong&gt; Establish an academic integrity review mechanism and conduct rigorous originality verification for interdisciplinary research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical education’s “Tiangong” should not be a privilege reserved for a select few, but rather a true cradle for nurturing medical elites.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wide Base Exponential Fixed Investment (also known as “Bullet Strategy”): Brokerage ETF, Heng Seng Tech Index</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/broad-based-index-etf-investing/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 21:58:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/broad-based-index-etf-investing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve always wanted to do things, like buying a suitable blue-chip stock and just letting it sit, waiting for it to drop so I could assess the situation before adding more, and selling when it rose. The result was that I never managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding an appropriate blue-chip stock is troublesome; instead, choosing a broad market index ETF would suffice. My current plan is: a brokerage ETF and the Hong Kong Tech Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of trading strategy described above has a professional term: “bottom fishing” (buying back when the price is falling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what’s next, my plan is to choose a broad market index to thoroughly practice it – achieving an annualized return that outperforms regular savings account interest rates would be the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brokerage-etfs&#34;&gt;Brokerage ETFs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brokerage ETF is an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) whose primary investment target is Chinese securities companies. It primarily invests in the listed stocks of Chinese securities companies in the stock market. Brokerage ETFs typically track a specific brokerage company index, such as the China Securities Brokerage Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I previously bought one, but it was at a peak and ultimately resulted in losses, so I liquidated my position. In the Chinese market, whenever there’s a bull run, brokerage companies are bound to rise – and by how much, depends on investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-tech-index&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Tech Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index is an equity index launched by the Hong Kong Exchange, designed to reflect the overall performance of the technology industry in Hong Kong markets. The index includes major technology companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, covering areas such as internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 20, 2025, the top ten constituent stocks of the Hang Seng Tech Index (code: 800700) and their weightings are listed below (data sourced from multiple authoritative sources):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

    &gt;00700.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 8.14%&lt;/li&gt;

    &gt;09988.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 7.72%&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kuaishou-W&lt;/strong&gt; ([01024.HK](http://01024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-tech-index-1&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Tech Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;

    &gt;00981.HK&lt;/a&gt;): Approx. 5.70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NetEase-S&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09999.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09999.HK&lt;/a&gt;): Approx. 4.59%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ctrip Group-S&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09961.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09961.HK&lt;/a&gt;): Approx. 4.48%
&lt;strong&gt;Total Percentage:&lt;/strong&gt; Approx. 66.6% (Note: Some sources show the top ten combined percentage between 68%-69%, due to differences in statistical timing.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-notes&#34;&gt;Key Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight Cap Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;: The Hang Seng Tech Index sets an 8% weight limit for individual stocks. For example, before the adjustment on March 2025, SMIC’s weighting exceeded 8%, but was subsequently passively reduced to comply with the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constituent Stock Adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;: On May 16, 2025, the Hang Seng Index Company announced that BYD ( &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://01211.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;01211.HK&lt;/a&gt; ) will be included in the index and Shun Hing Assets ( &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://00772.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;00772.HK&lt;/a&gt; ) will be excluded. The adjustment will take effect on June 6th. Therefore, as of today (May 20th), the constituent stocks are based on the pre-adjustment list, and BYD has not yet been included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry Distribution&lt;/strong&gt;: Among the top ten constituent stocks, internet technology companies (such as Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan) dominate, with new energy vehicles (Xiaomi, Ideal) and semiconductors (SMIC) having significant weights, reflecting the index’s coverage of technology and the new economy. &lt;strong&gt;Data Timeliness:&lt;/strong&gt; The primary differences in data from various sources stem from differing statistical time points. For example, data from March 2025 showed a combined top ten share of approximately 69.4%, while data from May 14th indicated 68.82%, reflecting the dynamic impact of market fluctuations on the weighting distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;short-put-cover&#34;&gt;Short Put Cover
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Short Put Cover” strategy is an investment approach where investors, anticipating a stock price approaching its bottom as it continues to decline, actively buy in batches to reduce their cost basis and wait for future price recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method falls under the category of “short trading,” which involves counter-trend operations before the market has clearly found its bottom. Specifically, investors typically employ a “pyramidal” layering strategy – gradually increasing the purchase quantity as the stock price declines, thereby reducing the average cost basis of their holdings. For example, initially buying a certain number of shares, if the price continues to fall, the investor increases the purchase volume at a lower price, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce Cost Basis:&lt;/strong&gt; By purchasing in batches during the decline, you reduce the average cost basis of your holdings, creating conditions for future profits. - &lt;strong&gt;Strategic Positioning (Early Layout):&lt;/strong&gt; Establishing positions before the market reverses, aiming to realize greater profits when the market rebounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; If stock prices continue to fall, it could lead to larger losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Tie-up:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires sufficient funds to continuously add to positions and may face a situation where capital is long-term blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively speaking, “right-side trading” involves buying after the market trend becomes clear and there are definite signs of an upward movement in stock prices, which carries lower risk but could miss out on some initial gains during a rebound. Therefore, investors should choose a strategy suitable for their risk tolerance, capital situation, and market judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory&#34;&gt;Valuation Theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuation theory is a core concept in finance that aims to assess the intrinsic value of assets or companies, providing a basis for investment decisions. Through valuation, investors can determine whether the current market price of an asset is reasonable and develop appropriate investment strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Valuation Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by an asset over its future period and discounts these cash flows to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The DCF method emphasizes intrinsic value and is suitable for evaluating companies with stable and predictable earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative Valuation Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method assesses a company’s relative value by comparing valuation metrics such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, and Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio with those of other companies in the same industry. - Relative Valuation Method is straightforward to operate, widely used for rapid assessment and comparison within the same industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asset Basis Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method determines a company’s value by evaluating its net assets – total assets minus liabilities. The Asset Basis Method is suitable for asset-driven companies such as real estate firms or capital-intensive businesses.
&lt;strong&gt;Application of Valuation Theories:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Decisions:&lt;/strong&gt; Through valuation, investors can identify undervalued or overvalued assets and develop buy or sell strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate Mergers &amp;amp; Acquisitions:&lt;/strong&gt; In M&amp;amp;A transactions, valuation is key to determining the transaction price and influences the success or failure of the deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory-1&#34;&gt;Valuation Theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Reporting:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies need to assess the fair value of their assets and liabilities to ensure the accuracy and transparency of financial statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that valuation results are influenced by various factors, including market conditions, company operations, macroeconomic indicators, etc. Therefore, when conducting a valuation, it is necessary to consider all factors comprehensively and combine qualitative and quantitative analysis to obtain a more accurate assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AI Development Over Two Years: Somewhat similar to the state before a Docker release – fragmented and rapidly evolving.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-like-docker-pre-release/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:16:37 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-like-docker-pre-release/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been one of the most hotly debated topics in the technology field in recent years, particularly over the past two years, with AI technology experiencing rapid advancements. Whether it’s deep learning, natural language processing, or computer vision and automated decision systems, the application scenarios for AI are constantly emerging. However, despite continuous technological breakthroughs, AI still faces a bottleneck similar to that of a Docker release – a lack of a killer app to truly ignite the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article: AI has developed for two years, which is somewhat like the state of Docker’s pre-release, lacking a killer application, based on existing technologies, create a perfect landing scenario, Docker doesn&amp;rsquo;t use too many new technologies, but the overall solution is reasonable, and it changes the workflow of operations and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-development-status-the-technology-is-mature-but-applications-still-need-breakthroughs&#34;&gt;AI Development Status: The Technology is Mature, but Applications Still Need Breakthroughs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, AI has made significant progress in the past two years. Whether it’s OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT series models or Google&amp;rsquo;s BERT and DeepMind&amp;rsquo;s Alpha series, AI processing capabilities have far exceeded previous expectations. Particularly in the field of natural language processing, models like GPT-4 not only possess powerful generative abilities but also demonstrate astonishing performance in understanding and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite technological advancements, AI’s implementation in practical applications faces certain challenges. Similar to Docker&amp;rsquo;s state before its release, although AI has enormous potential, there isn&amp;rsquo;t yet a killer application that can be widely adopted and transform industries. Everyone is talking about the future of AI, but it may not always be possible to find an application scenario that can directly bring about revolutionary change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;docker-and-ai-parallels-technology-doesnt-have-to-be-innovation-its-about-the-solution&#34;&gt;Docker and AI Parallels: Technology Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Have to Be Innovation, It’s About the Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the history leading up to Docker’s release, we can readily see many similarities between the technological environment at that time and the current state of AI development. Before Docker, container technology wasn’t a new concept; early technologies like LXC (Linux Containers) and virtualization already possessed the basic capabilities for containerization. However, Docker didn&amp;rsquo;t introduce disruptive technology itself. Instead, it presented a simpler, more intuitive, and efficient solution through the clever integration and optimization of existing technologies. This solution didn’t bring about revolutionary technology, but it addressed many pain points in operations and development processes, dramatically simplifying software deployment, scaling, and management workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the AI field is facing a similar situation. Currently, AI technology is no longer a “new thing,” but to truly achieve large-scale applications, it still requires a perfect landing scenario. Like Docker, integrating and optimizing existing technologies to form a reasonable application solution. A killer AI application may not rely on groundbreaking technological breakthroughs, but rather how to integrate existing technologies to solve pain points and needs in actual business operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-ais-docker-moment&#34;&gt;How to Find AI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Docker Moment&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly enable the widespread adoption of AI technology, we need to focus on several key areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Exploration of Real-World Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;
Currently, many AI applications are still primarily experimental in nature and lack large-scale real-world implementation. Areas such as AI customer service and intelligent recommendations are widely used, but their functionality is still limited and has not yet broken through industry bottlenecks. True breakthroughs may come from industries that have been plagued by traditional methods for a long time, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics. AI can help these companies improve efficiency and reduce costs in complex scenarios through more efficient data processing and predictive analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productization and Ease of Use&lt;/strong&gt;
Similar to how Docker simplifies containerization processes to improve operations efficiency, the ease of use of AI products is equally crucial. AI’s proliferation isn&amp;rsquo;t just about the spread of technology; it’s also about the proliferation of its products. Integrating AI into daily workflows, allowing users to easily utilize these tools without needing to deeply understand the underlying technology, is a crucial step in AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecosystem Building &amp;amp; Standardization&lt;/strong&gt;
Any new technology’s widespread application relies on ecosystem building. Docker’s rapid rise is due to its openness and compatibility, enabling developers to seamlessly connect with various cloud platforms, tools, and services. Similarly, AI&amp;rsquo;s future depends on the construction of an ecosystem. The standardization of AI, model sharing, data openness, and technological integration will all influence whether AI can form widespread industry applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-the-future-of-ai-is-full-of-possibilities-but-requires-more-refined-implementation&#34;&gt;Conclusion: The Future of AI is Full of Possibilities, but Requires More Refined Implementation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant advancements in AI technology over the past two years, it remains in the stage of “lacking killer applications” at present. Similar to containerization technology before Docker’s release, AI needs a reasonable application scenario to deeply integrate existing technologies with business requirements in order to truly achieve large-scale adoption and widespread use. While technological innovation is important, solutions that can simplify processes and improve efficiency are more likely to drive the popularization and development of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, AI may evolve like Docker – not through disruptive technological breakthroughs, but by integrating existing technologies to create a perfect application scenario, ultimately changing the way we work and live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Golden Week and National Day holiday periods saw the stock market’s “ice and fire dichotomy”: dramatic swings between soaring gains and sharp declines.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/stock-market-rollercoaster-ahead-of-national-day/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:42:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/stock-market-rollercoaster-ahead-of-national-day/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the eve of China’s National Day in 2024, the stock market experienced a remarkable surge, attracting considerable attention. However, following the holiday, the market unexpectedly turned to a dramatic plunge. This “polarization” of the stock market – a rollercoaster ride between soaring highs and plummeting lows – not only subjected investors to a thrilling yet nerve-wracking experience, but also prompted deep reflection on policy, economics, and market fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Insert relevant news snippets and data visualizations here - this section would be populated with actual content for a blog post.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-national-day-stock-surge-a-policy-driven-frenzy&#34;&gt;Pre-National Day Stock Surge: A Policy-Driven Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the five trading days leading up to National Day, China’s stock market surged from a slump into “boiling mode.” On September 30th, the A-share market saw a broad rally with all indices hitting historic highs. The Shanghai Composite Index rose by 8.06%, the Shenzhen Component Index increased by 10.67%, and the ChiNext Board Index soared by 15.36%, with the northbound CSI 50 Index setting a record for the largest single-day rise, jumping 22.84%. Market sentiment was extremely exuberant, with daily trading volumes across the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing Stock Exchanges reaching RMB 2611.5 billion, up RMB 1155.9 billion compared to the previous day. More than 5300 stocks on the main board rallied collectively, creating a “sea of red.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving force behind this rally was the concentrated release of a series of unexpectedly positive policies by the government and the resulting changes in market expectations. On September 24th, the People’s Bank of China announced a cut in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) and interest rates, reducing the interest rates on existing mortgages, and unified the minimum down payment ratios for mortgages. At the Central Political Bureau meeting on September 26th, it was emphasized that efforts should be made to intensify counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policy adjustments, strive to boost capital markets, and actively guide medium and long-term funds into investment. On September 30th, a series of ten real estate support policies were released. These policy measures conveyed the government’s firm determination to stabilize the market and promote growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-national-day-stock-market-plunge-calm-and-adjustment-after-the-frenzy&#34;&gt;Post-National Day Stock Market Plunge: Calm and Adjustment After the Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, market sentiment plummeted sharply after the National Day holiday. On October 8th, the A-share market opened strongly with nearly a limit-up rise, but following a significant high opening, the market experienced violent fluctuations before closing down. Since then, the market’s center of gravity has continuously shifted downwards, and as of October 16th, the Shanghai Composite Index rose and fell by more than 15%, cumulatively falling by over 470 points. From October 8th to 10th, core A-share indices all declined, with the Shenzhen Component Index down 6.21%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this plunge are multifaceted, on one hand, digesting the accumulated risks from a rapid rise in the previous period, and on the other hand, related to adjustments in market expectations regarding policy. Some investors believe that the short-term effects of policies have become apparent, but the long-term effects still need to be observed. Furthermore, fluctuations in global markets also impacted A-shares. On October 9th, the Hang Seng Index plummeted by 9.41%, and A50 futures fell by 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflection-and-outlook-on-the-market&#34;&gt;Reflection and Outlook on the Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dramatic volatility in the stock market around National Day highlighted a deep reflection among investors regarding policy, economics, and market fundamentals. On one hand, the short-term stimulus effects of policies were significant, but their long-term impact remains to be observed. On the other hand, the rapid rise and fall of the market served as a reminder for investors to maintain rationality and avoid emotional investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, whether A-shares can usher in a genuine “long bull” trend depends on whether policy can effectively transmit to the real economy and ultimately drive substantive improvements in economic fundamentals. Investors should closely monitor the specific implementation of policies and changes in economic data to rationally adjust their investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp rallies and crashes in the stock market around National Day were a game between policy and the market, and also a test of investors’ mindset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Spring Festival box office Nezha Goes Wild (Nezha Strikes Back)</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ne-zha-breaks-through-during-spring-festival/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:40:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ne-zha-breaks-through-during-spring-festival/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation of the provided Chinese text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As Chinese people, every Spring Festival, we gather with our families for reunion dinners and watching movies has become an indispensable entertainment activity. This year’s Spring Festival box office hit, &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt;, exploded out of its niche, sparking discussions on streets and in alleys. The scale is impressive, reminiscent of the previous blockbuster, &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, carrying a strong patriotic theme that inexplicably evokes a sense of national pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article, topic: The explosive popularity of &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt; at the Spring Festival box office, the inexplicable feeling of national pride, similar to previous films like &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, with a patriotic theme. While there has been significant progress, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t reached this level. As gamers, many aspects seem greasy, and the combat scenes are heavily influenced by online games. There have already been people who bought movie tickets for &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt; solely because of its box office revenue but didn’t actually watch it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-combat-scene-lacked-texture&#34;&gt;The Combat Scene Lacked Texture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a gamer, I’m usually immersed in various online game worlds, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have high expectations for movies. However, with the huge buzz around &lt;em&gt;The Water Margin&lt;/em&gt;, everyone around me was talking about it, and I thought, “Let me take a look.” When I entered the cinema, as soon as the scene came on screen, my heart sank. Although the production quality had improved compared to before, some scenes looked a bit greasy, and the combat scenes… well, they were too heavily influenced by games. Having played so many years of games, the visual style was too similar to certain scenes in those games, lacking the texture that a movie should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crazy-fanatics&#34;&gt;Crazy Fanatics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the movie, I went out to see what people were saying online. Apparently, some people bought tickets for &lt;em&gt;The Soul of the Demon&lt;/em&gt; solely to boost its box office revenue. Seriously, I have to admit that I’m impressed – it seems like everyone is incredibly passionate about supporting this film and willing to do something for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storyline&#34;&gt;Storyline
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s reflect on it: back when &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt; came out, Wu Jing shouted “Anyone who dares to harm China will be punished, no matter how far away,” and countless people felt a surge of patriotism, believing that our Chinese military was incredibly powerful and our country exceptionally strong. Although &lt;em&gt;The Battle Between Heaven and Earth&lt;/em&gt; didn’t have such a direct patriotic slogan, it vividly showcased traditional Chinese culture. Characters like Nezha and Ao Bing, mythological figures we&amp;rsquo;ve grown up hearing stories about since childhood, had their feuds, loves, and growth journeys depicted with flesh and blood in the film. This is precisely the charm of Chinese culture, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take Nezha as an example. He was misunderstood and ostracized from a young age, but he refused to give up, shouting “My destiny is not determined by others, but by myself,” which resonates so strongly with the resilience ingrained in every Chinese person. No matter what difficulties we face, we don&amp;rsquo;t bow down; instead, we strive to change our fate through our own efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advancements-in-animated-films&#34;&gt;Advancements in Animated Films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;The Fire on the Mountain&lt;/em&gt; (Nezha) had some imperfections, it effectively combined traditional Chinese culture with modern film techniques, allowing us to see significant progress in Chinese animated films. Just as &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated China’s breakthrough in the action film genre. This kind of advancement makes us feel that Chinese cinema can emerge onto the international stage and allows foreigners to witness the brilliance of Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chinese people, no matter where we go, we carry our nation and culture within us. Films like &lt;em&gt;Nezha&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt; are like keys that unlock the deep-seated sense of national pride within us. They allow us to feel the strength of our country and the charm of our culture while laughing and enjoying ourselves, also inspiring us to work hard in our respective roles and contribute our share to the prosperity and flourishing of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>“Making an investment and making money isn’t urgent, and even if you’re anxious, it won’t help.”</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:30:24 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on years of stock trading experiences, although I didn’t make a fortune, I also didn&amp;rsquo;t lose too much. The biggest issue was an unreasonable allocation of funds and an unstable mindset. Currently, my primary source of income is work, earning a fixed salary each day through part-time jobs. My ability to withstand financial fluctuations remains at the level of bonds and bank deposits. However, people are inherently greedy; if you buy too little, even when prices rise, you won’t make money; if you buy too much, you will lose money. At this point, maintaining a stable mindset is particularly important, as it can help us keep our wealth afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article: Addressing the mental issues in stock trading finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-loss-cases&#34;&gt;Historical Loss Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the initial entry into the market, I’ve encountered small-cap and near-new stocks. Later, my investments focused primarily on blue-chip large-cap stocks: Industrial Bank, China Unicom, HK Electronics, ZTESC, and various large index funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Expecting an annualized return while hearing bullish calls about matching a bank&amp;rsquo;s three-year fixed deposit,” in reality, it was driven by greed wanting more, leading to hasty increases in positions followed by depletion of cash flow. Purchases of insurance, real estate, and weddings represented significant capital outflows, and overall, there wasn’t enough liquidity allocated for these investments, resulting in insufficient funds later on. Buying blue chips is like aligning with “old money”—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Evergrande ran into trouble, bank stocks plummeted dramatically, successfully capitalizing on the opportunity to clear out positions. This reflects a lack of understanding regarding the impact on the broader economy. The real estate sector’s dominance within China&amp;rsquo;s economic landscape necessitates avoiding a hard landing; consequently, continued stock market declines affected red-chip stocks like &lt;strong&gt;Industrial Bank&lt;/strong&gt;, which rose for about two years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the initial stages of the trade war, &lt;strong&gt;Zhongxing&lt;/strong&gt; was severely impacted, and its share price also fell sharply. It has since gradually recovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HSPE (Hubei Hongyu Electronic)&lt;/strong&gt; is a legacy company; after Ant Group’s departure, its stock price also plummeted significantly. However, this stock benefits from market manipulation by a major shareholder, which allows it to surge several times per year. With reasonable position control, losses can be minimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;greed-the-monster-devouring-reason&#34;&gt;Greed: The “Monster” Devouring Reason
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greed is the most common problem in a stock trading mindset.&lt;/strong&gt; When stock prices rise steadily, and investors’ account profits continuously increase, greed quietly takes root. Many people still fantasize about continued upward movement of stocks even when they are already at high levels, craving more gains, and refusing to cut their profits. They are blinded by greed, forgetting the existence of market rules and risks. For example, during the hype of certain hot-topic stocks, some investors see a doubling or even several times increase in prices over a short period, and become trapped, constantly adding to their positions, hoping to be the last winner. However, the market will not always go crazy; when the bubble bursts and stock prices plummet sharply, these investors driven by greed often suffer heavy losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-the-chains-that-restrict&#34;&gt;Fear: The “Chains” That Restrict
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is the counterpart to greed. It possesses a powerful destructive force in the stock market as well. When market conditions suddenly reverse and stock prices plummet dramatically, investors are prone to panic. This fear erodes their confidence in the market, even when the fundamentals of their holdings are sound, leading them to hastily sell off their shares out of a fear of further losses. For example, during periods of global financial crises, even high-quality blue-chip stocks saw significant declines alongside the broader market. Some investors were consumed by fear and failed to recognize the long-term value of these companies, selling their stock at extremely low prices and missing out on the substantial returns that came with subsequent market rebounds and company performance growth. Fear not only causes short-term losses for investors but can also create a lasting psychological shadow over the stock market, making them hesitant to re-enter investments and thus losing out on investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blind-following-losing-direction-in-the-fog&#34;&gt;Blind Following: Losing Direction in the &amp;ldquo;Fog&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stock trading and wealth management, blindly following trends is another psychological pitfall that investors easily fall into. In an era of information overload, various investment suggestions, market rumors, and hot topics are rampant. Many investors lack independent thinking and judgment abilities, blindly following others&amp;rsquo; operations. When they see their peers making money by buying a particular stock, they immediately follow suit without further thought; when they hear so-called &amp;ldquo;insider news,&amp;rdquo; they readily share it. This blind following behavior ignores the research and analysis of the underlying stocks, causing investors to be like lost ships in the fog, losing their own direction. For example, some momentum stocks can generate short-term gains for followers during the initial market hype. However, as the hype fades and stock prices plummet, those investors who lack understanding and blindly follow become “pickup operators.” They fail to realize that each investor’s risk tolerance, investment objectives, and investment horizon are different; an investment strategy suitable for one person may not be suitable for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overconfidence-the-hidden-rocks&#34;&gt;Overconfidence: The Hidden “Rocks”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence is also a significant issue in the investment and financial mindset. Some investors, after achieving several successful investments, begin to inflate their egos, believing they have mastered market patterns and can accurately predict stock movements. They ignore the complexity and uncertainty of the market, engage in excessive trading, blindly expand their investment scale, and even use high leverage for speculation. However, the market is ever-changing, and overconfident investors often suffer severe setbacks in a single unexpected market fluctuation. For example, some investors with limited experience who achieved an initial victory believe they possess professional investment capabilities and begin to frequently buy and sell stocks, continuously increasing their investment amount. When systemic risks or sudden negative news about individual stocks emerge, they fail to cut their losses promptly due to overconfidence, leading to a significant reduction in their principal amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-for-stable-investing&#34;&gt;How to Adjust Your Mindset for Stable Investing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish the Right Investment Philosophy: Investors should clearly understand that stock investing and wealth management are aimed at achieving long-term, stable asset appreciation, not overnight riches. By learning investment knowledge, understanding market rules, adopting value investing and long-term investment philosophies, and avoiding being swayed by short-term profits and market sentiment, you can make informed decisions. For example, thoroughly research a company’s fundamentals, paying attention to its profitability, industry position, management team, and other relevant factors, choosing stocks with long-term investment potential rather than blindly chasing short-term trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a Reasonable Investment Plan: Based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals, create a scientific and reasonable investment plan. Clearly define key elements such as the amount to invest, the investment timeframe, expected returns, and stop-loss points, and strictly execute according to the plan. This can help avoid impulsive decisions made due to emotional fluctuations during investment. For example, set the investment proportion of each stock to no more than a certain percentage of total assets, and promptly take profits when the price rises to reach the expected return, and decisively cut losses when it falls to the stop-loss point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control emotions and remain calm: When facing market volatility, you need to learn to control your own emotions, maintain calmness and rationality. You can relieve investment pressure by diverting attention, engaging in physical exercise, or communicating with others, avoiding negative impacts of emotion on investment decisions. When the market experiences a significant fluctuation, first calmly analyze the reasons, combine them with your investment strategy and stock fundamentals, and make rational judgments instead of blindly following trends or panic selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-for-steady-wealth-management&#34;&gt;How to Adjust Your Mindset for Steady Wealth Management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous Learning and Reflection: The stock market is constantly evolving, and investors need to continuously learn new investment knowledge and skills, paying attention to macroeconomic trends, industry dynamics, and company information, and constantly improving their investment level. At the same time, it’s important to regularly reflect on your investment behavior, summarize experiences and lessons learned, identify problems in your mindset and decision-making, and promptly adjust and improve them. For example, after each investment, review the entire process, analyze the reasons for success and failure, and think about how to avoid similar mistakes in future investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in stocks and wealth management is a long and challenging journey, and mindset plays a crucial role. Only by maintaining a rational, calm, humble, and independent-thinking mindset can you steadily progress through the stock market’s fluctuations and achieve the preservation and appreciation of your wealth. ## How to Adjust Your Mindset for Steady Financial Planning&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Echoes of bygone years, offering unconventional fantasies and emotional solace.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 22:12:57 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the earliest web novel readers entered middle age, the types of “revenge” stories catered to them also evolved. The protagonists often appeared as fathers, mentors, or elderly figures, reflecting the different needs and desires of middle-aged readers regarding life and emotions. These works no longer solely focused on upgrades and reversals; instead, they emphasized emotional resonance and life reflections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;target-audience-shifting-reader-base-amidst-the-passage-of-time&#34;&gt;Target Audience: Shifting Reader Base Amidst the Passage of Time
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former web novel readers have largely transitioned into middle age. They’ve experienced the trials and tribulations of life, leading to shifts in their mindset and values. The passionate, adventurous elements they once chased are no longer the sole focus for them. Instead, they seek emotional resonance with their current lives and a sense of nostalgia for past years, as well as aspirations for the future. Middle-aged &amp;ldquo;fresh novels&amp;rdquo; emerged specifically to meet this psychological need. They utilize plot settings that closely align with the lives and attitudes of middle-aged readers, attracting this particular demographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;role-shift-from-young-hero-to-middle-aged-guardian&#34;&gt;Role Shift: From Young Hero to Middle-Aged Guardian
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Students Are All Villains:&lt;/strong&gt; The protagonist, Lu Zhou, after becoming a master, faces a group of disciples with diverse personalities and formidable strength. They teeter between good and evil, and Lu Zhou must guide them towards the righteous path. This novel showcases the challenges and confusion faced by middle-aged individuals when educating the next generation through interactions with their disciples. Furthermore, the growth and transformation of the disciples offer hope and a glimpse into the future, mirroring expectations for one&amp;rsquo;s children or younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emotional-resonance-life-reflections-and-family-responsibilities&#34;&gt;Emotional Resonance: Life Reflections and Family Responsibilities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sixty-Year-Old Birthday System:&lt;/strong&gt; The protagonist gained a system upon turning sixty, embarking on a new life journey. This setting allows middle-aged readers to feel a sense of “it’s never too late” hope and inspiration. Even having reached old age, the protagonist can still realize their value and dreams through the system. This plot encourages readers to reflect on opportunities missed or unfulfilled in their own lives, while also conveying an optimistic attitude, encouraging them not to give up pursuing their goals at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-design-aligning-with-the-rhythm-and-humor-of-middle-age-life&#34;&gt;Plot Design: Aligning with the Rhythm and Humor of Middle Age Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot designs for middle-aged “revenge” novels often place a greater emphasis on the details of life and the nuanced expression of emotions. Unlike young adult revenge novels that prioritize rapid upgrades and adventures, they focus more on relationships between characters and emotional entanglements. For example, in &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Master Craftsman&lt;/em&gt;, the protagonist’s friendship with his apprentice, their brotherhood with fellow disciples, and other bonds were depicted in detail. This plot design allows middle-aged readers to feel warmth and familiarity, as if seeing their own family, friendships, and love in life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spring Festival Blockbuster Movie Ticket Price Mystery: The Difference Between Online and Offline Prices</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-movie-ticket-price-mystery/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:02:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-movie-ticket-price-mystery/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the Spring Festival, a family of seven or eight people wanted to go see a movie. They originally planned to buy tickets on Taopiaopiao and Maoyan. When they looked at the price, it was 60 yuan. Luckily, they had a cinema recharge card that required them to purchase tickets at the cinema’s front desk. They thought about asking the front desk if there were any discounts, but unexpectedly, the same showtime cost only 35 yuan when purchased at the front desk. The price difference was quite surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hidden-add-on-of-platform-service-fees&#34;&gt;The “Hidden Add-on” of Platform Service Fees
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While online ticketing platforms are convenient, platform service fees cannot be ignored. They provide users with a seamless booking experience, such as precise seat selection and the ability to view purchase history at any time – all of which require investment in maintenance. These costs are then passed on to consumers through increased ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cinema-differentiation-operation-strategies&#34;&gt;Cinema Differentiation Operation Strategies
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the explosive demand for movie-watching during the Spring Festival, cinemas adopted differentiated pricing strategies to maximize revenue. Online platforms have a large volume of traffic, and many people are accustomed to purchasing tickets online in advance; therefore, cinema ticket prices were set higher on these platforms. Meanwhile, those buying tickets directly at the box office – walk-in customers – received lower prices to attract this segment of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-price-logic-behind-revenue-sharing&#34;&gt;The Price Logic Behind Revenue Sharing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue sharing models between online platforms and cinemas impact ticket prices. For an online platform to take a slice of the box office revenue – in order to maintain profitability – they will typically raise ticket prices. Conversely, cinema box offices have no intermediary sales process, resulting in lower costs, which naturally leads to more affordable ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consumer-ticket-buying-tips&#34;&gt;Consumer Ticket Buying Tips
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t just look at online platforms when buying tickets. Call the cinema&amp;rsquo;s front desk to inquire about prices, or go directly to the front desk and ask – you might find a surprise! If you frequently watch movies, get an auditorium membership card to enjoy member discounts and save money.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Analysis of Political Elements in 2025 Spring Festival Film Releases</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-films-spring-festival-2025/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:49:42 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-films-spring-festival-2025/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I went to the Spring Festival movie release to join in the crowds, and this time I watched two films that felt quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the new changes in the 2025 Spring Festival movie releases, focusing on &lt;em&gt;Dwelling in the Fuchun Pavilion&lt;/em&gt; (Tangrenjie Tanjian 1900) and &lt;em&gt;Nezha: The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Child&lt;/em&gt;. The former utilizes the backdrop of San Francisco’s Chinatown in 1900 to depict the discrimination and oppression faced by Chinese people, reflecting social and political conditions. As an animated film, the latter employs rich metaphorical elements to subtly critique the current international political landscape – such as the Jade Palace resembling the Pentagon mirroring the American political system, the dollar symbol on the Heavenly Mandate Throne symbolizing U.S. dollar hegemony, the jade amulet held by the immortals representing green cards and signifying social status, and the Soul-Devouring Elixir akin to biological weapons reflecting malicious actions. Both films offer a new viewing experience and prompt reflection on the relationship between cinematic art and political expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovation-in-the-style-of-chinese-new-year-film-releases&#34;&gt;Innovation in the Style of Chinese New Year Film Releases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, films released during the Spring Festival often featured lighthearted entertainment and family-friendly themes, aiming to allow audiences to relax and unwind during the holiday season, rarely addressing sensitive political topics. However, in 2025, the Spring Festival release broke with convention; &lt;em&gt;The Mystery Down South 1900&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nezha: Part One&lt;/em&gt; incorporated rich political elements, sparking widespread discussion among viewers and bringing a new atmosphere to the Spring Festival film slate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shanghai-noon-1900-a-vivid-depiction-of-era-politics&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shanghai Noon 1900&amp;rdquo;: A Vivid Depiction of Era Politics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shanghai Noon 1900&amp;rdquo; is set in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown in 1900, a time when Chinese immigrants faced severe racial discrimination and oppression overseas. The protagonists not only have to solve the mystery of the case but also confront discrimination and unfair treatment from all sides of society. The film’s portrayal of racism and power struggles accurately reflects the social and political environment of that tumultuous era, allowing us to see the difficult struggle of Chinese immigrants for survival and dignity, and the underlying political issues worth deep consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such historical context inevitably reminds us of the challenges currently faced by overseas Chinese in the business sector, such as the TikTok and Zhou Zaikun incident. As of December 6, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C., rejected TikTok’s request, ruling that the congressional law passed under national security grounds requiring a forced sale stood up to constitutional scrutiny. TikTok CEO Zhou Shouheng wrote in a memo to employees that the next step would be “seeking an injunction and awaiting review by the U.S. Supreme Court.” The issue stems from the U.S.’s “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Control of Critical Technology” Act, which mandates that ByteDance must divest its TikTok business within 270 days after passage of the law, with a final deadline of January 19, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cop-next-door-1900-a-vivid-depiction-of-political-times&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Cop Next Door 1900&amp;rdquo;: A Vivid Depiction of Political Times
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to various hearings, Zhou Haosheng also faced numerous difficulties. On January 31, 2024, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on “Big Tech and the Crisis of Online Child Sexual Exploitation,” featuring well-known anti-China lawmaker Tom Cotton. Facing Zhou Haosheng, Cotton fired off eight questions regarding his nationality, including asking if he was Chinese, whether he had applied for Chinese or American citizenship, and even probing into the nationalities of his wife and children. Despite the hearing’s focus on “online child sexual exploitation,” the lawmaker shifted the topic to TikTok being owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance, prompting Zhou Haosheng to answer irrelevant questions. “Just as in &lt;em&gt;The Mystery of Chinatown 1900&lt;/em&gt;, Chinese people abroad faced unwarranted discrimination, Zhou Shengyi also encountered unfair treatment and scrutiny in the business sector due to his background with TikTok. This series of events reflects how overseas Chinese have consistently faced formidable obstacles when pursuing their own development and safeguarding their rights across different eras – whether it’s racial prejudice a century ago or today&amp;rsquo;s political manipulation in commerce – warrants deep reflection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-deer-and-the-phoenix-born-to-be-wild-political-metaphor-behind-the-myth-unveiled&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Deer and the Phoenix: Born to Be Wild&amp;rdquo;: Political Metaphor Behind the Myth Unveiled
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Deer and the Phoenix: Born to Be Wild&amp;rdquo; appears to be a typical animated film, but many of its settings and plots are laden with political metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping of Power Systems&lt;/strong&gt;: The Yuhuang Palace is shaped like the center of supreme power in the celestial realm, with architectural styles similar to the U.S. Pentagon, primarily using white tones symbolizing Western hegemony disguised under the banner of “universal values.” The &amp;ldquo;Monster Hunting Team&amp;rdquo; led by Wuliang Xianzun, with its subordinates Lu Ban and He Feifei, are believed to correspond to the US alliance system of Japan and Korea. The Yuhuang Palace’s “online meeting” scene, where twelve golden immortals gather to discuss the “Battle of Opening Heaven,” is like the NATO meetings led by the United States, suppressing other countries under the guise of “maintaining order.” - &lt;strong&gt;Subtext of Economic Hegemony&lt;/strong&gt;: The Yu Huh Palace’s celestial tripod used for alchemy, with dollar signs at the entrance, symbolizes America “refining” other nations’ resources through economic hegemony.  The Great Immortals Wu Liangxian, invoking the name of “upholding heaven and earth,” cast the dragons into the cauldron to be refined, much like certain countries exploiting interests under the guise of “international rules.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metaphor for Identity and Hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt;: The fairy identity amulet obtained by Nezha, with its color and pattern design resembling an American green card, symbolizes the immortals’ rejection and hierarchical division of “foreign races,” hinting at the differences and unequal treatment between different nations and groups in reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Allusions to Malicious Actions&lt;/strong&gt;: Great Immortals Wu Liangxian forcing Nezha to take the Soul-Destroying Pill, which resembles a bioweapon, darkly alludes to certain countries using the guise of “saving the world” to carry out destructive and ruinous actions against others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-deer-and-the-phoenix-born-to-be-wild-a-political-allegory-hidden-behind-mythology--an-analysis&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Deer and the Phoenix: Born to Be Wild&amp;rdquo;: A Political Allegory Hidden Behind Mythology – An Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbol of Resources and Development:&lt;/strong&gt; The Seven Colored Lotus, as a key to reshaping Niuwa and敖丙’s bodies, symbolizes monopolized energy and technological lifelines dominated by major powers. Its “瓊漿玉液” (琼浆玉液 - literally &amp;ldquo;jade elixir and pearl liquid&amp;rdquo;) requires obtaining through the Yuxu Palace&amp;rsquo;s “成仙考试” (cheng Xian kaoshi – “Celestial Transformation Examination”), reflecting developing countries’ reliance on core resources and suffering from “rule-based plunder” within a hegemonic system. The Lotus’ temporary failure and restoration conditions metaphorically represent the survival dilemmas of small nations in an era of energy crises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deep-reflections-on-cinematic-art-and-political-expression&#34;&gt;Deep Reflections on Cinematic Art and Political Expression
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These films, amidst the nationwide viewing craze during the Spring Festival, incorporated political elements, offering audiences a new cinematic experience – one that moved beyond simple entertainment and served as a mirror reflecting political issues within history and reality. This has prompted us to delve into the relationship between cinematic art and political expression. Will directors in future film creations increasingly convey their perspectives on social and political matters through cinema? As a powerful cultural transmission medium, can film simultaneously engage in artistic expression while also taking greater notice and consideration of societal realities? These questions are worth exploring as we appreciate films, and we look forward to the film industry bringing more exciting integration of art and real-world expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-egg&#34;&gt;Easter Egg
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boabab large model, wasn&amp;rsquo;t performing very well today, it froze several times, the article stopped halfway and couldn’t continue, so I had to restart the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The two major political parties in the United States – the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:40:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Party and the Republican Party exhibit significant differences in political ideology, policy proposals, and social values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;political-ideologies-and-policy-positions&#34;&gt;Political Ideologies and Policy Positions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/strong&gt;: Leans towards liberal/left-wing, advocating for the government to play an active role in economic and social affairs, supporting social welfare, environmental protection, and multiculturalism. Regarding tax policy, the Democratic Party supports tax cuts for low- and middle-income individuals while increasing taxes on high earners and corporations. On social issues, the Democratic Party supports abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and advocates for strict gun control. In foreign policy, the Democratic Party emphasizes multilateralism and diplomatic means, preferring to address global problems through international cooperation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Republican Party&lt;/strong&gt;: Leans towards conservative, advocating for limited government intervention, emphasizing individual liberty and a free market economy. Regarding tax policy, the Republican Party supports tax cuts, believing they should apply to everyone regardless of income. On social issues, the Republican Party opposes abortion and same-sex marriage, supports the right to bear arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-significance-of-trumps-ascension&#34;&gt;The Significance of Trump’s Ascension
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump was re-elected as President of the United States in 2024, marking the Republican Party&amp;rsquo;s dominance in American politics. Trump’s policy positions included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump advocated for stimulating economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation, particularly supporting the development of traditional manufacturing and energy industries. He also favored protectionist trade policies, renegotiating or withdrawing from existing trade agreements to protect America’s economic interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immigration Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump planned to strengthen border security, restrict illegal immigration, and implement stricter scrutiny and limitations on legal immigrants. He also supported limiting refugees and asylum seekers to maintain national security. - &lt;strong&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/strong&gt;: Trump favored a unilateral approach, emphasizing “America First,” reducing reliance on international organizations, reevaluating relationships with allies, and employing tougher diplomatic measures when necessary. He also planned to expand fossil fuel production and usage and loosen restrictions on environmental protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s potential second term could lead to significant adjustments in U.S. domestic policy and have a profound impact on global politics and economics. His policies were likely to draw attention and reaction from the international community, particularly in areas such as trade, environment, and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DeepSeek suddenly went viral before the Spring Festival, NVIDIA stock plummeted: The behind institutional operations and the chain of thought for large models.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-explodes-before-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-plummets-behind-the-scenes-and-large-language-model-reasoning/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:36:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-explodes-before-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-plummets-behind-the-scenes-and-large-language-model-reasoning/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Spring Festival, DeepSeek had become a hot topic, attracting widespread attention on social media in just a few days. This sudden surge in popularity was surprising and triggered a chain reaction in the market. Meanwhile, NVIDIA’s stock price plummeted, raising concerns among many investors, with some institutions conducting large-scale short selling during this period, seemingly pointing to a “carefully orchestrated” situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deepseeks-sudden-surge-in-popularity-rapidly-becoming-a-focus&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s Sudden Surge in Popularity: Rapidly Becoming a Focus&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is an AI-powered tool focused on optimizing deep learning models, particularly in the application of natural language processing (NLP) and image generation. In the days leading up to Chinese New Year, this project suddenly garnered significant attention from investors and tech professionals alike. The performance of its team and the demonstrated technical results sparked strong interest among many. Discussions about DeepSeek dominated all topics within the developer community and on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, DeepSeek’s sudden surge in popularity was not accidental. After analysis, many began to suspect that certain entities may have been involved behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nvidia-stock-plummets-the-hand-behind-the-short-selling-operation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia Stock Plummets: The Hand Behind the Short Selling Operation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), has long been a key hardware provider for many large models and AI computations. With the rapid development of the AI market, Nvidia’s stock has performed strongly over the long term and even become a favorite among many investors. However, with the explosive popularity of DeepSeek and the market&amp;rsquo;s intense focus on its technology, Nvidia’s stock experienced a dramatic plunge.
The underlying cause of this phenomenon may involve institutional investor short selling strategies. Over the past few years, as AI technology has spread, Nvidia’s stock price has been significantly inflated, leading many investors to believe that it carries risks of excessive speculation. Particularly after a technology like DeepSeek went viral, some institutions may have profited substantially by shorting Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chain-of-thought-reasoning-with-large-models-from-results-to-process&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Large Models: From “Results” to “Process”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In traditional artificial intelligence applications, many practitioners and investors have focused more on the “results” of AI models – such as generated images or text outputs. In discussions related to DeepSeek, however, an increasing number of people are beginning to realize that the underlying chain-of-thought is the core content worth paying attention to behind large models. Previously, we could only see the results of model output, but now we need to understand the logic, algorithms, and how to optimize model performance by adjusting these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in thinking represents a deep reflection on AI research and application. From simple black-box operations to a genuine shift towards understanding the internal workings of models, leading many technologists and investors to re-evaluate the future direction of artificial intelligence. The popularity of DeepSeek perfectly represents a breakthrough in this thought chain, prompting people to focus on the entire model construction and optimization process rather than just the final output results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sudden surge in popularity of DeepSeek, NVIDIA’s stock plummet, and the subsequent short-selling activities by institutions – it all seems like a meticulously designed scheme. Through an in-depth understanding of large model chain-of-thought reasoning, we can see that the application of AI technology is not merely superficial layering of phenomena, but also deep digging and optimization of the model’s internal logic. As the technology progresses, we may see more innovative tools like DeepSeek in the future, driving AI research and applications to a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon not only shows us the immense potential of AI technology, but also prompts us to start thinking about the commercial games and capital operations behind the technology. The future market trend will continue to be the focus of the battle between technology and capital.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The End of the Age of Barbaric Capital: The End of the League of Legends Esports Era</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-league-of-legends-era/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:19:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-league-of-legends-era/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The esports industry has experienced rapid development over the past decade and a half, becoming an increasingly significant cultural phenomenon worldwide. Particularly games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; (LoL), a MOBA title, have not only provided players with competitive enjoyment but also injected substantial momentum into capital investment, driving the flourishing development of various esports platforms and events. However, this all entered a phase of gradual decline alongside increased capital influx and the rise of the broader entertainment industry. The rise and fall of PandyTV, the competition between DouYu and Huya, marked the end of the “wild capitalism era,” and it seems that the favorable conditions – time, place, people, and heaven – for esports are also beginning to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-injection&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Injection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1 Early Esports: From Grassroots to Professionalization&lt;/strong&gt;
The early esports industry started relatively grassroots, especially in the Chinese market. Many players participated in competitive games like &lt;em&gt;StarCraft&lt;/em&gt; and Dota, driven by their love for gaming. However, the true rise of esports began with the release and promotion of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Following the official entry of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; into the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche community to become part of mainstream culture. Notably, starting in 2013, the LPL (China Professional League) began to form, and &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; became the cornerstone of China’s esports industry.
&lt;strong&gt;1.2 Capital Flood: The Rise of PandaTV and Esports Streaming Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;
2015 marked a watershed moment for China&amp;rsquo;s esports industry. The influx of capital transformed esports from purely competitive events into a much larger ecosystem. Pandahua (PandaTV), as one representative, became a product of excessive capital. Funded by Wang Sicong (one of the founders of PandaLive), Pandahua quickly rose to prominence with its innovative content and massive investment, attracting a large number of viewers and users. However, this was also a typical example of capital “barbaric” inflow – the market’s frantic pursuit of capital often lacks patience and long-term vision. Although Pandahua&amp;rsquo;s financial and human resources achieved certain results in the short term, it ultimately declared bankruptcy in 2019 due to management issues and excessive reliance on capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.3 Live Streaming Platform Competition: The “Capital War” between DouYu and Huya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-injection-1&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Injection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline of PandaTV did not lead to a decline in the esports live streaming industry; instead, it fueled the rise of platforms like DouYu and Huya. The two major live streaming platforms quickly became leaders in the esports industry, with competition between them intensifying. DouYu initially established itself as a benchmark for esports live streaming through its broadcasts of professional &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; tournaments and by signing top streamers. Meanwhile, Huya gradually narrowed the gap with DouYu through increased investment in esports events and its own diversified platform layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, capital played a significant role once again. In 2018, DouYu successfully went public, and Huya also completed an IPO the same year. The rapid flow of capital led to industry consolidation and resulted in intense competition between platforms regarding streamers and copyrights, forming a “capital battle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-fusion-of-mass-entertainment-and-esports&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Fusion of Mass Entertainment and Esports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1 The Trend Towards Mass Entertainment: Capital Flows into Diversified Entertainment Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With significant capital investment in the esports industry, esports platforms are gradually moving towards mass entertainment. Esports anchors no longer limit themselves to match commentary and event broadcasts; they begin to expand into singing, dancing, live interaction, and other forms of entertainment. The content on the platform becomes more diverse, gradually forming an ecosystem centered around esports but incorporating various entertainment elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this trend towards mass entertainment has also brought problems – the original focus of esports culture is being marginalized, replaced by a trend of “entertainment above all.” This trend has caused some fans who originally loved esports culture to feel alienated, and capital is increasingly turning its attention to other entertainment fields. - Excessive capital influx and profit-seeking have gradually blurred the essence of the esports industry, with core values centered around competition weakening.
&lt;strong&gt;2.2 The Rise of Pan-Entertainment Industry: Capital Withdrawal and Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;
As short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and the entertainment industry (including K-pop) have risen, capital has gradually shifted funds from esports to a broader range of entertainment content. In this process, giants such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance no longer rely solely on esports projects for profit, but have increased their investments in areas such as film, music, and short videos.  In particular, the rise of ByteDance, through the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin (TikTok), has overshadowed esports with other entertainment content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-three-league-of-legends-yellow-doesnt-follow-yellow-the-decline-of-the-eras-advantage&#34;&gt;Chapter Three: League of Legends’ “Yellow Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Follow Yellow”: The Decline of the Era’s Advantage
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has almost been synonymous with China’s esports industry, achieving countless professional players, teams, and events, and also spawning a massive esports ecosystem. However, after more than a decade, as a leading project in Chinese esports, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; has entered a phase of “Yellow Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Follow Yellow.” Particularly in recent years, the influence of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; is gradually declining, even exhibiting obvious signs of decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1 The “Fracture” in Player Demographics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most noticeable change is the fragmentation of player demographics. Initially, the rapid development of esports relied on the support of a large number of young players who became professional players or spectators thanks to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. That generation of internet addiction teenagers almost grew up under the “timeshare dividend,” immersed in the competitive appeal of League of Legends. This, in turn, drove the rapid expansion of the entire industry. However, as time passed, these players gradually matured and entered society, shifting towards other life and career paths. Simultaneously, a new generation of young players didn’t show the same fervor for &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; as in previous years, and the esports audience has developed a noticeable age bias and decline in interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-league-of-legends-yellow-never-follows-green-the-decline-of-the-eras-advantage&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: League of Legends’ “Yellow Never Follows Green”: The Decline of the Era’s Advantage
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2 The “Stagnation” of Game Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, despite numerous updates and revisions, has begun to show signs of stagnation in its competitive appeal. Annual version releases, hero balance adjustments, and the introduction of new gameplay mechanics seem unable to fundamentally address players&amp;rsquo; demand for fresh content. Simultaneously, the MOBA market has become increasingly saturated, with other games (such as &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;) rapidly rising in popularity and diverting a significant portion of League of Legends’ player base. This competitive landscape has left League of Legends perpetually playing the role of “follower,” unable to break free from its position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-where-does-the-esports-industry-go-from-here&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Where Does the Esports Industry Go From Here?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The esports industry is like a skyscraper that sprung up seemingly overnight. Excessive capital roams within the internet industry, searching for the next big trend, and esports has become one of their targets. Leveraging China’s demographic dividend, the esports industry achieved tremendous success in a short period. However, this success wasn&amp;rsquo;t built on a solid foundation. Over-investment by capital, talent shortages, and weak game content are all hindering the healthy development of the esports industry. Prior to university, I didn’t play many games, and the League of Legends was essentially a companion throughout my growth. I watched so many World Championships, and as an outsider, comparing Chinese and Korean players, especially Faker, domestic players always felt apprehensive and hesitant during major tournaments. I also understand that professional gamers face immense psychological pressure, but this industry has developed for over ten years, and their mental health issues should be prioritized by the teams – which they weren’t. Domestic gameplay still relies on individual player talent.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Games to Home: Why We Gradually Distance Ourselves from the Virtual World as We Grow Up</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-leave-virtual-worlds-as-we-grow-up/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:11:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-leave-virtual-worlds-as-we-grow-up/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When did I ever feel the most joy playing games? As a child, sneaking onto my parents’ TV to play Tank War, Super Mario, and Space Invaders, or secretly using our computer with my cousin to play Age of Empires – or even in college, playing Devil May Cry and League of Legends with my roommates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, there were no worries about life, and when we played, we truly immersed ourselves completely. That sense of immersion is something you can never find again as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the changes in times and social progress, those of us who once thrived in the virtual world have gradually realized that the platform filled with joy and competition seems to be drifting away from our lives. The disconnection of game social links, accompanied by players falling out of line, is not only due to technological advancements and the replacement of games themselves, but also because of a shift in our center of gravity in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disappearance-of-gaming-socialization-a-tug-of-war-between-virtual-and-real-worlds&#34;&gt;The Disappearance of Gaming Socialization: A Tug-of-War Between Virtual and Real Worlds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people’s youth, games were more than just entertainment; they were a social way to connect. A popular multiplayer online game didn&amp;rsquo;t just offer in-game challenges and competition – it connected players from all over the world, building virtual social circles. Back then, playing dungeons together, forming teams for PvP combat, was part of everyday life. Those late-night voice chats and sharing of daily experiences became a cherished part of our memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as time went on, more and more players realized that this experience of virtual socialization didn’t have lasting appeal. With the constant updates and evolution of games, and the diversification of social platforms, players gradually found more interactive ways to connect outside of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gaming-and-responsibility-the-shift-in-focus-of-adult-life&#34;&gt;Gaming and Responsibility: The Shift in Focus of Adult Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you enter adulthood, responsibilities gradually increase. Many young people once invested a significant amount of time in games, but as their careers begin or they start living with partners and forming families, these activities that previously seemed indispensable entertainment are increasingly squeezed by the demands of real-life responsibility. Marriage, having children, even caring for parents, all these major life responsibilities force individuals to make choices about their energy and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming becomes a thing of the past, replaced by the priority of family life. Many young people who once “fought” in games gradually discover that real life is the most important subject. Especially after having children, the focus of life completely shifts towards family, and gaming is gradually pushed to the periphery of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-games-to-home-how-life-changes-influence-our-entertainment&#34;&gt;From Games to Home: How Life Changes Influence Our Entertainment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within our life experiences, the family is one of the most important components. And once you enter family life, the division of time and energy becomes more specific and limited. Many young parents find that they no longer have enough time to focus on games they used to love, especially in order to care for children and spend time with their spouses. They often even stop chasing updates and new features in games. Gradually, social platforms and offline interactions with friends and family have become the preferred way for more people to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean we completely abandon entertainment activities; it simply means we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen ways that better suit our current life stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-farewell-of-virtual-worlds-how-do-we-view-this-transition&#34;&gt;The Farewell of Virtual Worlds: How Do We View This Transition?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many who were once immersed in games, saying goodbye to gaming social wasn’t easy. After all, the virtual world that had once brought us joy and accomplishment had long become a part of our memories. However, farewell doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean complete severance; it’s about making different choices as life changes, balancing our roles in real-life. As we grow older from our youthful beginnings into responsible adults, games may still have their value, but they can no longer be the main rhythm of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this transition also reflects a facet of human adaptability – our ability to adjust our focus and lifestyle as different stages of life unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-of-gaming-perhaps-well-see-another-wave-of-sense-of-belonging&#34;&gt;The Future of Gaming: Perhaps We’ll See Another Wave of “Sense of Belonging”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, as society and technology continue to develop, the forms and content of games are constantly evolving. For example, modern multiplayer online games have begun to evolve towards more relaxed and flexible ways, with some designs even focusing on family interaction and parent-child relationships. In the future, we may see more game formats that can better integrate into family life and provide players with healthier, more balanced social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as many people reminisce about “games from their childhood” with nostalgia and passion, perhaps in a moment of unintentional discovery, we will pick up those games again, bringing with us new understanding and insight, and re-enter that virtual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;living-in-change-yet-still-loving&#34;&gt;Living in Change, Yet Still Loving
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s games or family life, the changes in our lives always accompany us as we grow. In this process, we gradually realize that, although the virtual world brings us endless joy and excitement, ultimately, we will return to reality, back to the warmest place of all – family. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to regret leaving games behind because every stage of life has its own unique meaning. And these changes are what make us a more complete person.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Town Brahmin: The “Big Man” of Small Places</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:02:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the popular &amp;ldquo;Da Bing&amp;rdquo; (Big Ice) on Douyin (TikTok) has been frequently seen with short video accounts extracted from her live streams. A listener who joined a live call asked: “Da Bing, I want to sell my house in Xi’an and return home to settle down.” Da Bing responded: “At your age, you&amp;rsquo;re in your early thirties; you can’t settle down. Your parents are on the path of aging, your children haven’t started a family or established themselves, and if you return home, you’ll still have to deal with the &lt;em&gt;parames&lt;/em&gt; (婆罗门) in the small county.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s put aside whether the viewpoint is right or wrong, what does the term “&lt;em&gt;parames&lt;/em&gt;” (婆罗门) mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;township-brahmins-the-big-shots-of-small-places&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Township Brahmins: The “Big Shots” of Small Places&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many small county towns, people often talk about so-called “township brahmins”—the existence of these individuals seems to be a symbol of local society. They are not necessarily genuine religious figures and do not possess “high-level” titles; rather, they are seemingly ordinary but nonetheless influential people. They represent “power, status, and influence” within that county town, symbolizing a particular class or stratum in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-xiancheng-babao&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an “Xiancheng Babao?”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand that “Babao” originally referred to the highest caste in Indian society, representing wisdom, authority, and spiritual supremacy. In China’s county towns, the term “Xiancheng Babao” doesn&amp;rsquo;t have such a complex religious background; it’s more of a metaphor for a social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, an “Xiancheng Babao” can be understood as some “cultural authorities” within the county town – such as teachers, doctors, well-known merchants, and officials, etc. Although their positions may seem ordinary, in this relatively closed environment, they possessed a comparatively higher social status, or their opinions and actions had influence that could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-the-township-brahmin&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is the &amp;ldquo;Township Brahmin&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In towns and counties, you’ll often find figures like this – the “Brahmin.” They might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educators:&lt;/strong&gt; Particularly teachers who have spent decades working in the area, not necessarily graduates of prestigious universities, but who understand how to build credibility through knowledge and are widely respected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Government Officials:&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy county magistrates, section chiefs, etc., who control certain resources and power – even if their positions aren’t high-ranking, their limited scope of authority can make them local “Brahmins.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local &amp;ldquo;Entrepreneurs&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/strong&gt; Some business owners in rural towns, though not large in scale, hold a certain amount of wealth and have a voice in the community. They might operate one or two well-known local small businesses and wield considerable influence within the town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-status-of-county-town-brahmins--how-does-it-impact-society&#34;&gt;The Status of “County Town Brahmins” – How Does it Impact Society?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the significance of “county town brahmins,” we must consider the unique environment of the county town. Here, information flow is slower than in large cities, and social class mobility is more fixed. These “brahmins” often accumulated prestige, knowledge, and connections through long-term dedication to the local area. They influence various aspects of local politics, economics, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; In small places, especially where education systems may not be as developed and people have fewer choices, local &amp;ldquo;brahmins&amp;rdquo; subtly shape the cultural atmosphere through knowledge transmission in classrooms, explanations in media, and even moral guidance in social settings. &lt;strong&gt;Concentration of Social Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the limited population and resources in county-level cities, these “Brahman” figures were often one of the primary controllers of local resources. Whether it was social welfare, policy implementation, or the approval of certain projects, they invariably exerted influence. Their power of speech and decision-making allowed them to hold a position within the local society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Web of Interpersonal Relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; In a relatively closed small community, interpersonal relationships are often crucial. These “county Brahman” figures established powerful social networks to control information flow and resource allocation, thereby playing a decisive role at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-metaphor-of-the-county-sharma&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Metaphor of the “County Sharma”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the “county sharma” (or “town Brahmin”) is often regarded with respect and admiration, this position of privilege isn’t without its issues. In modern society, it&amp;rsquo;s not difficult to see that many county-level “sharmas” lack genuine ability and innovative spirit; instead, they maintain their positions through hereditary relationships and resource monopolies. With the development of informatization, these “sharmas’” power is gradually being eroded, and new social mobility is beginning to influence the appearance of small counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the “county sharma” is a fascinating social phenomenon that reflects the power and cultural structures within local societies. Although their “power” may not directly threaten national governance, they are undoubtedly key figures within the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this would have happened if we hadn’t started with curiosity about what a ‘purohito’ was, and then tossed it to ‘kimi.’ The result was surprisingly funny – I could see the web interface already pulling up search results, but instantly they were blocked from displaying related content. So I wondered, did this word hold some special significance? Then I passed it on to ‘ChatGPT,’ and that’s how this article came about.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Balancing Bank Marketing Strategies with the Art of Personal Financial Management</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 01:33:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the renovation project at home has led to a surge in daily expenses. I’ve also been using credit cards, paying them off within the billing cycle, although I have enough cash on hand, I prefer to keep it in money funds to earn some additional interest income. Furthermore, to ensure financial stability, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up automatic payment functionality so that my credit card bills can be paid promptly upon maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-status-deposits-increase-loans-decrease&#34;&gt;Bank Status: Deposits Increase, Loans Decrease
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst increasing economic uncertainty, people are more inclined to save rather than consume or invest. This has led to an increase in bank deposits, but it also means banks have to pay higher interest rates to depositors. Conversely, due to reduced consumer and investment activity, loan demand has decreased, making it difficult for banks to generate interest income through lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attract and retain customers, banks are forced to offer more competitive deposit rates, further compressing the bank’s net interest margin. Simultaneously, in order to stimulate economic growth and consumption, central banks may implement policies of lowering benchmark interest rates, which will also impact bank loan rates and consequently affect their profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;banking-marketing-strategies-cultivating-user-habits&#34;&gt;Banking Marketing Strategies: Cultivating User Habits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The due date was approaching quickly. First, the Bank of Communications contacted me, offering a one-year free installment service with no interest charges. Shortly after, China Merchants Bank also provided a 2.5% discount on installment interest rates, which translated to an annualized rate of 1.9%. Faced with these offers, I chose to accept installment services from both banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that banks truly go all out to cultivate user habits. According to the bank’s definition of “flow,” I should be a premium customer. In the current context of difficulty for banks in lending and deploying funds, by cultivating my installment awareness, the bank is actually preparing for potential future liquidity difficulties from me, at which point they can earn more interest income from me. After all, as we know, interest rates on credit card bill analysis are not low. Banks, by offering free installment services and low-interest installment promotions, not only increased the frequency and limits of credit card usage but also established a positive image in the minds of users. This shift in strategy reflects the bank’s rapid response to market changes and its deep understanding of customer needs. In this way, the bank not only solved the problem of difficulty in lending funds but also laid the groundwork for future profits – &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s not just about making money today; looking ahead is key to long-term sustainability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-personal-financial-management&#34;&gt;The Importance of Personal Financial Management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the appealing offers of installment financing from banks, as users, we should recognize the risks associated with over-reliance on credit card installments. We should carefully consider our repayment ability and future financial needs to avoid falling into long-term debt traps due to short-term financial convenience. Key to personal financial management is balancing current needs with future planning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The multifaceted nature of gaming: the intersection of psychological development and social entertainment.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 15:07:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s digital age, games have evolved far beyond a simple form of entertainment and have become an indispensable part of people&amp;rsquo;s daily lives. From a psychological perspective, games play different roles in the mental development of individuals across various age groups, while also being closely intertwined with social and recreational activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-state&#34;&gt;Mental State
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people are in the stage of self-exploration and identity formation. &lt;strong&gt;Games provide them with a low-cost environment to try and explore.&lt;/strong&gt; Through games, they can experiment with different roles and lifestyles, satisfying their curiosity and desire for exploration. As they grow older, individuals’ interests and values gradually stabilize, and games may no longer align with their life goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes&#34;&gt;Social Attributes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the game has also become a part of social activities, particularly for young people. They make friends and build social networks through games, making games a bridge for socialization. However, as people age, their social circles gradually stabilize, and social needs may be met through more mature ways, leading to a relative reduction in the role of games in socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes-bringing-a-sister-with-a-female-player&#34;&gt;Social Attributes: Bringing a Sister (with a female player)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within China, due to a lack of adequate dating education, parents often simply expect you to study well and then immediately want you to start a relationship after graduation. This phenomenon is very common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of busy studies, work, or a lack of social skills, individuals haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to establish stable emotional relationships in real life, leading to feelings of loneliness and a desire for attention. &lt;strong&gt;The “bringing a sister” behavior within games provides an outlet to release this craving.&lt;/strong&gt; By helping and protecting female players, they can experience being needed and valued, gaining emotional satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the interactive rules within games are clearly defined, and the environment is controllable, offering a sense of certainty and security compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real-life interactions, reducing fear of the uncertainties in real-world relationships. ## Social Attributes: Bringing a Sister (with a female player)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-world-pressure&#34;&gt;Real-World Pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games provide a virtual world where players can temporarily escape the pressures, challenges, or unpleasant emotions of real life. Particularly for young people facing academic pressure, family issues, or interpersonal relationship challenges, games may become a way to seek comfort and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are typically designed to give players a sense of accomplishment and recognition when completing tasks, leveling up, or defeating opponents. Young people may become addicted to games because they can experience a feeling of being appreciated and recognized within them – a feeling that may be lacking in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dislike-playing-after-getting-older&#34;&gt;Dislike Playing After Getting Older
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young, individuals face relatively fewer social responsibilities and pressures, allowing them more time and energy to invest in gaming. As they enter the workforce, start families, and take on other societal responsibilities, time and energy become increasingly valuable, and games may be seen as a drain rather than a preferred leisure activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, their cognitive abilities and interests also change. They might have been interested in fast-paced, visually stunning games when younger, but with increased experience, they may prefer strategy games, those with strong storylines, or games with greater depth. If the market doesn’t meet these changing needs, interest naturally diminishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game Psychology: Competitive Gaming</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-competitive-gaming/</link>

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay-to-Win games, which we won’t discuss here; within the gaming community, this is commonly referred to as “Renminbi Warriors” – requiring a wealthy wallet rather than an understanding of game settings. Their enjoyment lies in the entourage of smaller players and the thrill of “raid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitive games with large audiences, such as League of Legends, DOTA, Honor of Kings, and PUBG, have complete worldviews and well-established, positive competitive cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychology is a key area in game design, particularly social psychology. Understanding people’s behavior, needs, and motivations can help create more engaging gaming experiences. Regarding the relationship between “showing off” (装逼) and social psychology, we can examine it from several angles:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Validation:&lt;/strong&gt; People often seek to establish a sense of belonging within social groups. In games, designing elements that allow players to feel accomplished and noticed by other players can increase their social validation. This may manifest as boasting skills or showcasing earned rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games employ social competition elements, encouraging players to showcase their achievements within a social network. This can be achieved through leaderboards, achievement systems, or multiplayer battles. Such designs stimulate competitive psychology among players, potentially leading some players to perform more exceptionally in order to gain social recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Expression:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games allow players to express themselves through customization options like character avatars and virtual items. This self-expression isn’t just about showing off; it can also be a way to express personality and engage in social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teamwork:&lt;/strong&gt; Certain games emphasize teamwork, achieving game objectives through social interaction. In these scenarios, boasting behavior may not be encouraged but rather emphasizes collaboration and mutual support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Reward Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design can utilize psychological reward systems to incentivize positive social behaviors. For example, rewarding players or granting them privileges to encourage active participation in social interactions.
Overall, the application of social psychology in game design can be used to shape player interaction and social experiences. Fluffing (or showing off) behavior can sometimes occur in certain contexts, but game designers typically strive to balance this behavior to ensure the gaming experience is positive and enjoyable for all players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to get sidetracked when thinking about things; without a complete outline, it does tend to become a little disorganized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author’s frequently played League of Legends is considered one of our generation&amp;rsquo;s cherished childhood memories. Most parents don’t like their children playing games, as they haven’t deeply understood or experienced this type of game, and naturally, it has to do with the game’s setting. Each match is a fresh start, and for many kids, when playing, they don’t bring much thought into it, opting for a self-exploration style of gameplay. Under this mode, the outcome of the game often depends more on the player&amp;rsquo;s inherent gaming talent. Based on my personal experience, a significant portion of players fall into this category; for them&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost isn’t money, but time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s also a casual mode within the game, designed to meet the needs of entertainment players.
League of Legends, this competitive game, for me, was more about realizing a “Three Kingdoms dream.” Starting with an empty purse, relying on my own understanding, I farmed, supplemented, spent money, controlled vision, set traps for the enemy team, and it was primarily a game played with my mind – without exceptional gaming talent, I could still have a lot of fun. The feeling of controlling the overall situation and the joy of turning a disadvantage into a victory. And there are also many viewers who often mention “cloud players” – they no longer play the game but still watch the matches during major world championship events.
Here, we must also talk about “game time.” “I’m not talking about the time of a single game, but rather the time you log in. This includes weekend afternoons and evenings between 7 PM and 10 PM during weekdays – at this time, you&amp;rsquo;ll generally find that you can communicate normally with your teammates, receiving their signals and getting responses in return. However, if you switch to times like late-night gaming sessions, you’re more likely to encounter ‘gaming addicts,’ favorable wind conditions (where nothing happens), and opponents who will greet your entire family through the screen, accompanied by a palpable sense of ‘hostility’ even across the distance.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As someone working in the IT industry and having played many different types of games, I&amp;rsquo;ve always preferred to play competitive games using my brain rather than relying on reaction speed or innate talent. Compared to younger players or professionals, my response time is slower; I’m accustomed to grouping up with teammates and taking command as a team leader.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, how would you describe the current game environment? It’s quite frantic and lacks the pure essence of what it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduating, playing high-level ranked games was really exhausting – it required complete focus throughout the entire match, thinking about the opponent’s plans and how to counter their setups. It&amp;rsquo;s that state where you don&amp;rsquo;t want to continue playing after finishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you say you play very well, without professional competition, it wouldn’t have much impact on one’s life trajectory. While it can be a social tool, it cannot provide a livelihood or establish oneself in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-player and online games are two different types of games with significant differences in gameplay, experience, and technology. Here are some key aspects to understand the distinction between single-player and online games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connection Method:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-player Games (Offline/Single-player):&lt;/strong&gt; These games are played on a local device independently, without requiring an internet connection. Players can enjoy the game experience even without network connectivity. - &lt;strong&gt;Online/Multiplayer Games:&lt;/strong&gt; These games typically require an internet connection because players need to interact in real-time with other players. Online games can be cooperative or competitive, involving online social interaction and esports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player Interaction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players primarily interact with in-game artificial intelligence, pre-set tasks, or hostile elements. The gaming experience is typically more personalized and influenced by the game’s design and storyline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiplayer Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players can interact with other real players from around the world. This may include collaborating on missions, competing against each other, participating in esports, and social elements such as chat, guild systems, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Design and Content:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design focuses more on providing a complete and independent storyline and gaming experience. Game content is typically pre-designed, and players explore, solve puzzles, or engage in combat within the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiplayer Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design needs to consider real-time interaction and player competition or collaboration. Game content may be more dynamic, including regular updates, online events, and social interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Typically can run offline with relatively low requirements for device performance and internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Require a strong internet connection and have high demands on server and network performance to ensure smooth real-time interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Model:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Typically employ a one-time purchase or download model, where players buy the game to play it fully on their local devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; May utilize various business models such as free-to-play, advertising, item purchases, or subscriptions to maintain server operations and continuously update game content.
Understanding these distinctions helps players clarify their preferences when choosing games and enables game designers to better meet player expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
