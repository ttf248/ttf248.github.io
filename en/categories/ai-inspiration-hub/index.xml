        <description>&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s family planning policy, while limiting population growth, curbed familial development, disrupted traditional social structures, and suppressed the expansion of family businesses and political dynasties. Compared to South Korea’s chaebols and India’s family monopolies, its uniqueness is evident. Now that birth restrictions have been lifted, despite challenges like low birth rates, new monopoly risks must be guarded against, requiring a balance across various stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-rise-and-fall-of-population-control-and-family-style-development&#34;&gt;The Rise and Fall of Population Control and Family-Style Development
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family planning policy, a fundamental national policy in China for nearly forty years, has yielded significant results. Data shows that between 1978 and 2007, the natural population growth rate decreased from 12‰ to 5.2‰, reducing births by over 400 million, and China&amp;rsquo;s share of the world population fell from 22.2% to 20.1%. This sharp decline in population growth has profoundly reshaped Chinese society’s family structure. For example, in family businesses, the number of children born to owners significantly decreased: birth rates of three or more children dropped from 40.63% before the policy to 18.46% afterward, while single-child births increased from 6.25% to 32.31%. This structural change has directly led to a substantial reduction in the pool of potential internal successors for family businesses, objectively inhibiting their ability to expand across generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing South Korea and India, the differences are striking. Although South Korea has not implemented strict family planning policies, its birth rate has been persistently low (0.7 in 2023). However, chaebols maintain a firm grip on the national economy through cross-shareholdings and inheritance tax avoidance. The combined revenue of the five largest chaebols accounts for over 50% of South Korea&amp;rsquo;s GDP, with Samsung alone contributing 20%. India presents a different picture: family businesses contribute 79% of economic output, and six conglomerates control key sectors like telecommunications and steel. Twenty top companies account for 80% of the profits earned by all enterprises nationwide. The core difference lies in China&amp;rsquo;s family planning policy, which restricts family size and weakens the human resource base for family business expansion from the outset. Due to different policy environments, South Korea and India have allowed family influence to continuously permeate the economic sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;restraining-monopolies-and-social-structure-transformation&#34;&gt;Restraining Monopolies and Social Structure Transformation
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the family planning policy on the economic sphere is particularly evident in its suppression of monopolies. Reduced daughter numbers have prevented Chinese family businesses from forming chaebol-like groups, similar to those in South Korea. For example, Korean chaebols maintain control through &amp;ldquo;circular investment,&amp;rdquo; with families like Samsung holding only 2% of shares but controlling everything through a complex equity structure. In China, family businesses after the implementation of family planning often face the challenge of “succession,” leading them to introduce professional managers or implement diversified shareholding reforms. A study by The Paper found that the proportion of female successors in family businesses increased from 13.85% to 34.21% following family planning, with a significant increase in their educational attainment – the percentage with bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degrees or higher rising from 43.75% to 98.46%. While this transformation hasn’t completely eliminated family control, it has significantly reduced the possibility of monopolies dominated by single families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a societal level, the family planning policy accelerated the breakdown of the traditional family core model. Household size in China decreased from 4.41 people per household in 1982 to 2.62 in 2020, weakening the family&amp;rsquo;s functions in areas such as economics, education, and social support. In contrast, India maintains a household size of around 4 people, with the caste system deeply intertwined with familial power, resulting in limited social mobility. The shift towards smaller families in China has created space for individualistic development; by 2023, there were 240 million single adults, and the consumption market is seeing the rise of a &amp;ldquo;one-person economy,&amp;rdquo; further diluting the influence of family economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;decentralization-of-power-in-the-political-sphere&#34;&gt;Decentralization of power in the political sphere
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family planning policy has had a profound impact on the political landscape as well. Traditionally, familial influence permeated local politics through kinship and marriage ties. For example, in Xinyi County, Henan Province, 161 political families virtually controlled all government departments, with 20% of cadres at the deputy section level or above being &amp;ldquo;second-generation officials.&amp;rdquo; However, the implementation of the family planning policy reduced household size, limiting the expansion of familial networks. Research from Peking University shows that the number of children among officials decreased after the policy was implemented, leading to a significant decline in the complexity of political family networks. Furthermore, the policy promoted education (increasing average years of schooling from 5.2 in 1982 to 10.9 in 2023), fostering social mobility and weakening the monopoly of familial influence on political resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing South Korea and India, the deep entanglement of Korean chaebols with politics (such as financial transactions between Samsung executives and the government) and the hereditary family politics under India&amp;rsquo;s caste system highlight the uniqueness of Chinese policy. China’s birth planning policies have objectively reduced the possibility of power inheritance. While familial phenomena still exist in county-level politics, the overall trend is a dispersal of power structures. During the 2025 National People&amp;rsquo;s Congress, a CPPCC member proposed renaming the &amp;ldquo;Law on Population and Birth Planning&amp;rdquo; to the &amp;ldquo;Population and Fertility Law,&amp;rdquo; fully relaxing birth restrictions – a move that could further influence the evolution of future political ecology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;challenges-and-opportunities-after-policy-adjustments&#34;&gt;Challenges and Opportunities After Policy Adjustments
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the two-child policy in 2016 and the three-child policy in 2021 marked a significant shift in China’s birth policies. However, the effects have been limited: the birth rate in 2022 was only 1.18, far below the replacement level (2.1). Relaxing birth restrictions has a dual impact on family businesses: some entrepreneurs may strengthen their ability to pass down their legacy through having more children, as exemplified by Zong Fuli of Wahaha Group succeeding her father; conversely, high childcare costs (averaging 1 million yuan to raise a child to 18 in first-tier cities) and declining willingness among working women to have children are restricting family expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Releasing restrictions on childbirth could spur new monopolies in the economic sphere. The three-child policy is driving consolidation within industries like maternal and infant care, with the early childhood education market projected to reach 162.13 billion yuan by 2025. Leading companies are integrating smaller firms through mergers and acquisitions, resulting in a CR5 concentration exceeding 55%. While this consolidation may increase efficiency, it also poses monopolistic risks. The government must balance encouraging childbirth with preventing excessive market concentration – for example, strengthening antitrust regulation while providing childcare subsidies (such as the 3000 yuan monthly milk powder subsidy for families with three children in Hangzhou) to alleviate household burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easing birth restrictions may subtly impact family influence in the political sphere. While restoring traditional networks of familial politics is difficult in the short term, a rise in larger families could create new grassroots political influence over time. Therefore, refining cadre selection mechanisms and strengthening oversight (such as establishing rules to prevent relatives from holding positions) remain key to preventing power inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;international-lessons-and-future-prospects&#34;&gt;International Lessons and Future Prospects
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiences of South Korea and India demonstrate a close relationship between the rise and fall of family power and policy direction. South Korea achieved economic takeoff by supporting conglomerates (chaebols) but at the cost of social equity. India&amp;rsquo;s lack of effective policies to curb family monopolies has exacerbated wealth inequality. China’s birth planning policy, while controlling population growth, objectively suppressed the expansion of family influence, but also brought about issues like accelerated aging and labor shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, China needs to seek a new balance between population policy and socioeconomic development. This involves increasing birth rates through supportive policies (such as extended maternity leave and universal childcare facilities), while strengthening antitrust enforcement to prevent family businesses from forming new monopolies through financial operations. In the political sphere, further progress is needed in grassroots democracy construction, improving oversight mechanisms, and ensuring transparent governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the family planning policy, as a significant driver of social change in China, has had an impact far beyond the population sphere. It reshaped family structures, economic models, and the political landscape, providing a path for China to avoid falling into a Korean-Indian style trap of familial monopolies. As policies adjust, balancing efficiency with fairness, freedom with order within this new demographic context will be a long-term challenge for China.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Trade war put on hold</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2025 trade war tariff evolution showed a cycle of &amp;ldquo;escalation — retaliation — consultation,&amp;rdquo; shifting the US-China competition from tariff confrontation to rules-based competition. While short-term easing alleviated market pressure, long-term uncertainty remains; monitor the WTO rulings, supply chain adjustments, and geopolitical changes&amp;rsquo; continued impact on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People cannot earn money beyond their understanding. The stock market crash triggered by the trade war this year, even with a partial recovery now, has claimed countless retail investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timeline of Trade War Tariffs in 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of the 2025 trade war tariff timeline, incorporating key events from China, the US, and other countries to illustrate the evolution of tariff policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-april-2025-comprehensive-tariff-escalation-and-retaliation&#34;&gt;I. April 2025: Comprehensive Tariff Escalation and Retaliation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration signed order 14257, announcing a 34% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the US, covering products from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The U.S. is further raising tariffs on China from 34% to 84%, and has signed Executive Orders 14259 and 14266, imposing additional tariffs on more goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The White House revised an executive order, raising the total tariffs on China to 145%, and increasing duties on small parcels (e.g., raising the tariff rate on goods under $800 from 90% to 120%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China announced a 34% tariff on all goods originating from the United States, covering sectors like agriculture, automobiles, and energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China will retaliate by raising tariffs from 34% to 84%, matching the US escalation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China is removing 91% of tariffs on US goods (corresponding to the portion agreed upon by the US) and suspending the implementation of 90% of the remaining 24% tariffs, while retaining 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum products, prompting Canada to retaliate with tariffs on $2.98 billion worth of US goods and file a complaint with the WTO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The EU is imposing tariffs of up to 25% on US goods, while Japan expressed concerns over tariffs on US cars, calling the trade war &amp;ldquo;lose-lose.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;may-2025-geneva-talks-and-tariff-easing&#34;&gt;May 2025: Geneva Talks and Tariff Easing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China and the United States held 16 hours of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, resulting in the China-U.S. Geneva Trade Talks Joint Statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both sides announce suspension of some tariffs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US has suspended 24% of tariffs on China (for 90 days), retained 10%, and canceled additional duties scheduled for April 8th and 9th&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China will suspend 24% of retaliatory tariffs, retain 10%, and remove non-tariff measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both sides agreed to hold regular economic and trade consultations in China, the United States, or a third country, focusing on tariff reductions and rule-making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High tariffs are causing small and medium-sized enterprises to fail (e.g., Amazon sellers forced to close due to surging tariffs), and inflation expectations are rising (core PCE is projected to rise to 3.3%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China has tightened controls on rare earth exports, cracked down on smuggling, and impacted US military and new energy industries, forcing them to seek waivers for tariffs on key minerals like rare earths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canada and China have both filed disputes with the WTO against the US steel and aluminum tariffs and &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; alleging violations of the non-discrimination principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned that U.S. tariffs could cause a 1% decline in global trade volume by 2025, exacerbating the difficulties faced by developing countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 37-page list covers strategic materials such as rare earths, graphite, and medical CT tubes, exposing supply chain vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US imposed a 25% tariff on imported cars, leading to a projected 2% drop in global auto production and a 9% reduction in North America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration attempted to reshape the international trade order through &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; but was criticized as unilateral bullying, prompting a backlash from allies (such as the EU and Japan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China is responding to protectionism by expanding market access (such as through import fairs and zero-tariff commitments) to attract cooperation from developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;timeline-summary&#34;&gt;Timeline Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The US is imposing 34% retaliatory tariffs on China, covering goods from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The US will raise tariffs on China to 84% and introduce new tax orders&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;China retaliates with tariffs, initially 34%, later raised to 84%; US modifies tariffs to 145%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The US waived tariffs on some goods (like tech products), and China canceled 91% of its retaliatory tariffs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;China, US, and Japan Geneva talks result in a joint statement agreeing to suspend 24% tariffs (for 90 days)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Both sides announced suspension of tariffs and a consultation mechanism, easing trade tensions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trends-and-challenges&#34;&gt;Trends and Challenges
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tariff suspension between China and the US sends a positive signal, but structural issues (such as high technology and energy) remain, and midterm elections may affect policy continuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies are accelerating supply chain adjustments; Mexico and Southeast Asia benefit from &amp;ldquo;nearshoring,&amp;rdquo; but rising costs may curb recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is limited, and regional trade agreements (such as the US-UK agreement) have become alternative options, but this exacerbates fragmentation&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Jiangxi Province&amp;rsquo;s teacher recruitment from 2020-2025 shows a significant reduction trend: Special post teacher hiring decreased sharply from 6,617 to 32 (a 99.5% decrease), and national cadre teachers dropped from 11,324 to 2,146 (an 81.1% decrease). While the proportion of core subjects (language, math, English) remained stable, the overall volume contracted. Though the proportion of arts, music, and physical education increased, absolute numbers were limited (e.g., only 2 recruits in 2025 for each subject). Policy shifts towards &amp;ldquo;one-in, one-out&amp;rdquo; staffing restrictions, with teacher resources directed toward vocational education and remote areas, have led to a substantial reduction in traditional primary and secondary school positions; some subjects had zero planned hires in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Specialty teachers focusing on compulsory education subjects in rural areas will be limited to a small number of core subject positions in 2025&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National curriculum teachers cover all grade levels, with a more comprehensive range of subjects, including early childhood education and special education (not listed separately due to data limitations)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, Math, English) remains stable, but hiring volume is decreasing year by year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of subjects like arts, physical education, and music is increasing, but the absolute numbers remain limited (e.g., only 2 students admitted for each of arts, physical education, and music in 2025)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some subjects (such as English) have stopped admitting new students due to decreased enrollment&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The Celestial Realm of Medical Education and the Butterfly Effect of the Dong Xi-ying Incident</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-sky-dong-xiying-butterfly-effect/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 01:08:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-sky-dong-xiying-butterfly-effect/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Peking Union Medical Center &amp;ldquo;4+4&amp;rdquo; program (4 years of non-medical undergraduate + 4 years of medical PhD), emphasizing interdisciplinary elite training, was exposed in 2025 due to the Dong Xiying incident. Her entry into the program allegedly leveraged family background (a lineage of medical professionals/researchers), raising questions about her educational qualifications and allegations of plagiarism. This highlights a conflict between the program&amp;rsquo;s elitist admissions practices and fairness, alongside unresolved issues regarding shortened training periods and supervised practice concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt&#34;&gt;Prompt
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog post: The origins and development of Concordia 4+4. Key points: A corner of Heaven, seen by mortals; Miss Dong&amp;rsquo;s family background; it’s impossible for a normal medical PhD to graduate in eight years; Miss Dong&amp;rsquo;s family and educational backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disintegrated-palace-of-medical-education-unionmed-44&#34;&gt;The Disintegrated &amp;ldquo;Palace&amp;rdquo; of Medical Education: UnionMed 4+4
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;4+4&amp;rdquo; program at Peking Union Medical College, launched in 2018, has been regarded as a “heavenly palace” for medical education in China. Designed to emulate the American medical education system and guided by the principles of attracting individuals with diverse backgrounds, cultivating those with a passion for medicine, and recruiting talent from across the globe, it seeks to break new ground within the traditional medical education framework. Its core logic lies in &lt;strong&gt;用4年非医学本科教育+4年医学博士培养，替代传统的5+3+3（本科5年+硕士3年+博士3年）模式&lt;/strong&gt;, aiming to cultivate leading medical professionals with interdisciplinary expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Celestial Palace&amp;rdquo; attribute is reflected in three dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially, applicants were required to have graduated from universities ranked within the top 50 by QS/Times/US News or among the top 10 US News liberal arts colleges (such as Barnard College). While later relaxed to include schools ranked in the top 100, a GPA of 3.6 or higher, or being in the top 30% of their class is still required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilizing an American organ-system integrated curriculum and PBL (Problem-Based Learning) teaching methods, students must complete core courses such as anatomy and pathology within four years, alongside clinical internships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the passing rate for the licensing exam (95.2%) was slightly lower than the traditional eight-year program (98.5%), graduates largely enter Peking Union Medical Center affiliated hospitals, and their career development shows no significant difference from the traditional path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dong-xi-ying-incident-cracks-in-heavenly-palace-seen-by-a-mortal&#34;&gt;The Dong Xi-ying Incident: Cracks in &amp;ldquo;Heavenly Palace&amp;rdquo; Seen by a Mortal
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, a report of extramarital affairs involving Dr. Xiao Fei, a thoracic surgeon at the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital, unexpectedly exposed the &amp;ldquo;mystery&amp;rdquo; surrounding Peking Union Medical Center&amp;rsquo;s 4+4 project. The resume of the involved party, Dong Xiuying, raised three points of concern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;学历背景的模糊性&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Xiyi claims to have graduated from Columbia University, but in fact attended its affiliated Barnard College (ranked 14th by US News for liberal arts colleges in 2025). Although Barnard meets the &amp;ldquo;top 20 liberal arts college&amp;rdquo; requirement, its diploma simultaneously lists “Barnard College” and “Columbia University,” which can easily be mistaken for Columbia’s main campus in the domestic recruitment market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The path of a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in economics followed by a doctorate in clinical medicine, while meeting the &amp;ldquo;multidisciplinary background&amp;rdquo; requirement of the 4+4 program, has been questioned for lacking a foundation in pre-medical coursework. Furthermore, his doctoral dissertation, &amp;ldquo;Research on Multi-Modal Image Fusion Technology in Medical Image Analysis,&amp;rdquo; has been accused of significant similarity to a Beijing University of Science and Technology invention patent, raising concerns of academic misconduct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;家庭背景的特殊性&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His father is a secretary at China Metallurgical Research Institute, his mother is an associate dean at the Beihang University Engineering Technology Research Institute, his grandfather is an academician in the field of imaging at Peking Union Medical College, his maternal grandparents are foreign academicians in materials science, and his aunts and uncles are professors at Beihang University. This &amp;ldquo;medicine + research + university&amp;rdquo; family background provides him with hidden resources such as letters of recommendation (requiring two biomedical associate professors) and research collaborations (such as patents from Beihang University).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During residency, he switched from thoracic surgery to urology, with research spanning multiple fields including orthopedics, gastroenterology, and imaging, leading to accusations of &amp;ldquo;paving the way with resources.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;学制争议的放大&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional medicine doctoral programs require 11 years (5+3+3), while the 4+4 program compresses this to 8 years. Despite Peking Union Medical College&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on &amp;ldquo;integrated curriculum&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;early clinical exposure,&amp;rdquo; some doctors note that its clinical internship time (12 months) is less than the traditional eight-year system (18 months), potentially impacting skill development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some training bases allow a one-year reduction in required training for 4+4 graduates, raising concerns about fairness within the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dilemma-of-medical-education-behind-the-controversy&#34;&gt;The Dilemma of Medical Education Behind the Controversy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dong Xi-ying case reflects the deep-rooted contradictions in China&amp;rsquo;s medical education system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;精英化与公平性的冲突&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;application-review system&amp;rdquo; of the 4+4 program is essentially a transplant of the American medical school model, but China lacks standardized exams like the MCAT, and subjective evaluations such as letters of recommendation and research experience are easily influenced by family background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data shows that among the 2023 graduates (4+4 program), 30% came from Tsinghua, Peking University, and Fudan University, 25% from overseas prestigious universities, indicating a significant influence of family background on applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;学制改革的现实困境&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research output (e.g., publications) from 4+4 medical students is significantly lower than that of traditional eight-year programs, leading to criticism of prioritizing clinical experience over research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-tier hospitals prioritize the Peking Union Medical Center brand, while community hospitals are cautious about the clinical abilities of 4+4 program graduates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;医学教育的国际接轨之惑&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US 4+4 model requires passing the MCAT and completing 3-7 years of residency, while China&amp;rsquo;s 4+4 program simplifies admission and residency, resulting in a superficial resemblance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to data from the Ministry of Education, in 2024 nationwide medical doctoral program admissions, programs following the 4+4 model accounted for less than 5%, and their widespread promotion still faces challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reconstructing-the-celestial-palace-order-of-medical-education&#34;&gt;Reconstructing the &amp;ldquo;Celestial Palace&amp;rdquo; Order of Medical Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding the Union 4+4 project is fundamentally a clash between elite education and public expectations. When a corner of &amp;ldquo;heavenly palace&amp;rdquo; (referring to top-tier medical training) is glimpsed by ordinary people, it exposes not only flaws in individual cases but also deep-seated contradictions within the entire medical education system. Future reforms need to focus on three levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce standardized exams (like China&amp;rsquo;s version of the MCAT) to reduce the influence of subjective factors such as letters of recommendation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restore the internship period for 4+4 graduates to 3 years to ensure clinical competency standards are met&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish an academic integrity review mechanism, with rigorous originality verification for interdisciplinary research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical education should not be a privilege for a few, but a true incubator for medical excellence. Only when fairness in selection, rigor in training, and standardization of career development are comprehensively ensured can this &amp;ldquo;medical education experiment&amp;rdquo; truly take root.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to buy a solid blue-chip stock and just leave it, but I never managed to do it. When it fell, I didn&amp;rsquo;t add to my position, and when it rose, I sold it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding suitable blue-chip stocks is troublesome; it&amp;rsquo;s better to choose a broad index and buy an ETF. The current plan is: securities ETF, Hang Seng Tech Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trading strategy has a professional term: left-side dip buying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;broker-etfs&#34;&gt;Broker ETFs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securities ETF refers to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that primarily invest in listed securities broker stocks within the Chinese stock market. Securities ETFs typically track a specific securities brokerage index, such as the China Securities Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought it before, but chased after the price and ended up losing money, so I cleared out my position. In China&amp;rsquo;s market, every bull market sees brokerages rise; how much they rise depends on investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-technology-index&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Technology Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index is a stock index launched by the Hong Kong Exchange, designed to reflect the overall performance of the technology sector in the Hong Kong market. It includes major tech companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, covering areas such as internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 20, 2025, the top ten constituents and their weightings in the Hang Seng Tech Index (code: 800700) are as follows (data compiled from multiple authoritative sources):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;舜宇集团 (舜宇光学科技集团有限公司) (01810.HK): Approximately 8.82%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China Resources Pharmaceutical Holdings (00700.HK): Approximately 8.14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Country Garden (09988.HK): Approximately 7.72%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;京东集团-SW&lt;/strong&gt; (09618.HK): Approximately 7.60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;舜宇光学科技集团有限公司 (Sunvision Technology Co., Ltd.) (03690.HK): Approximately 7.35%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(01024.HK): Approximately 6.10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bold (02015.HK): Approximately 6.09%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;中芯国际&lt;/strong&gt; (00981.HK): Approximately 5.70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(09999.HK): Approximately 4.59%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approximately 4.48%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 66.6% (some sources indicate a combined share of the top ten between 68%-69%, with differences due to varying statistical time points)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-notes&#34;&gt;Key Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index caps the weighting of any single stock at 8%. For example, SMIC&amp;rsquo;s weighting previously exceeded 8% before adjustments in March 2025 but was subsequently reduced to comply with this limit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On May 16, 2025, Hang Seng Index Company announced that BYD (01211.HK) will be added to the index and China Literature (00772.HK) removed. The adjustment will take effect on June 6. Therefore, as of today (May 20), the constituent stocks are based on the pre-adjustment list; BYD is not yet included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The top ten components are dominated by internet technology companies (such as Tencent, Alibaba, and Meituan), with significant weighting in new energy vehicles (Xiaomi, Li Auto) and semiconductors (SMIC), reflecting the index&amp;rsquo;s coverage of technology and the new economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differences in data from various sources are primarily due to differing statistical time points. For example, data from March 2025 shows the top ten combined share at approximately 69.4%, while data from May 14th indicates 68.82%, reflecting the dynamic impact of market fluctuations on weighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-to-position-on-a-pullback-on-the-left-side&#34;&gt;Add to position on a pullback (on the left side)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;left-side topping up&amp;rdquo; strategy is an investment approach where investors buy in batches during a sustained stock price decline, anticipating the price is nearing a bottom to reduce holding costs and profit from future price increases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method falls under the category of &amp;ldquo;left-side trading,&amp;rdquo; meaning taking a counter-trend position before the market has clearly bottomed out. In practice, investors typically employ a &amp;ldquo;pyramid&amp;rdquo; accumulation strategy, gradually increasing buy quantities as the price declines to lower their average holding cost. For example, initially buying a certain number of shares; if the price continues to fall, they increase their buying volume at a lower price, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying in batches during a downturn can lower average cost basis and set the stage for future profits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing positions before the market reverses can yield greater returns when the trend improves if your judgment is correct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the stock price continues to fall, it may lead to greater losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adequate financial support is required for continuous restocking, and there&amp;rsquo;s a risk of funds being locked up long-term&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively speaking, &amp;ldquo;right-side trading&amp;rdquo; involves buying after a clear market trend and price recovery signal, offering lower risk but potentially missing early gains. Therefore, investors should choose a strategy that aligns with their risk tolerance, financial situation, and market judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory&#34;&gt;Valuation theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuation theory is a core concept in finance, aiming to assess the intrinsic value of assets or companies and provide a basis for investment decisions. Through valuation, investors can determine whether the current market price of an asset is reasonable and formulate corresponding investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is based on the expected future cash flows of an asset, which are then discounted to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The DCF method emphasizes intrinsic value and is suitable for evaluating companies with stable and predictable earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method assesses a company&amp;rsquo;s relative value by comparing its valuation metrics (e.g., P/E, P/B, P/S) to those of comparable companies in the same industry. Relative valuation is easy to implement and widely used for quick assessments and peer comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method determines a company&amp;rsquo;s value by assessing its net asset value, which is the difference between total assets and liabilities. The asset-based approach is suitable for asset-dominant companies such as real estate firms or capital-intensive businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through valuation, investors can identify undervalued or overvalued assets and formulate buy-or-sell strategies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In M&amp;amp;A transactions, valuation is key to determining the transaction price and influencing its success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company needs to fairly value its assets and liabilities to ensure the accuracy and transparency of financial statements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that valuation results are influenced by various factors, including market conditions, company operations, and macroeconomic indicators. Therefore, a comprehensive consideration of all factors, combined with qualitative and quantitative analysis, is necessary to achieve more accurate assessments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Two years of AI development: Its somewhat like the state before Docker was released</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-docker-pre-release/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:16:37 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/ai-development-two-years-docker-pre-release/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been one of the most discussed topics in technology in recent years, especially with its rapid advancements over the past two years. From deep learning and natural language processing to computer vision and automated decision systems, AI applications are constantly emerging. However, despite continuous technological breakthroughs, AI still faces a bottleneck similar to that of Docker before its release – a lack of a killer application to truly ignite the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of AI over the past two years is similar to the state before Docker&amp;rsquo;s release – lacking a killer application. It needs a perfect practical implementation based on existing technology, like Docker: not relying on groundbreaking new technologies, but offering a complete and reasonable solution that transforms operations and development workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-current-state-of-ai-development-technology-is-mature-but-application-still-needs-breakthroughs&#34;&gt;The current state of AI development: technology is mature, but application still needs breakthroughs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a technical perspective, AI has made significant progress in the past two years. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s OpenAI’s GPT series models or Google’s BERT and DeepMind’s Alpha series, AI processing capabilities have far exceeded previous expectations. Particularly in natural language processing, models like GPT-4 not only possess powerful generation abilities but also demonstrate astonishing performance in understanding and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite rapid technological advancements, the practical application of AI faces certain challenges. Similar to the state before Docker&amp;rsquo;s release, while AI has immense potential, a truly widespread and industry-transforming &amp;ldquo;killer&amp;rdquo; application hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet emerged. People discuss AI’s prospects but may struggle to find an application that can bring revolutionary change. Many AI applications remain in early experimental stages and require further integration and optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-similarity-between-docker-and-ai-technology-isnt-necessarily-innovation-solutions-are-key&#34;&gt;The similarity between Docker and AI: Technology isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily innovation, solutions are key
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the history before Docker&amp;rsquo;s release, we find striking similarities with the current state of AI development. Prior to Docker, container technology wasn&amp;rsquo;t new; early technologies like LXC (Linux Containers) and virtualization already possessed basic containerization capabilities. However, Docker cleverly integrated and optimized existing technologies, proposing a simpler, more intuitive, and efficient solution. This approach didn’t introduce revolutionary technology but addressed many pain points in operations and development processes, significantly simplifying software deployment, scaling, and management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the AI field faces a similar situation. While current AI technology is no longer &amp;ldquo;new,&amp;rdquo; achieving widespread application still requires a perfect implementation scenario – like Docker, integrating and optimizing existing technologies to form a practical solution. The “killer” application of AI may not depend on breakthrough new technologies, but rather on how to integrate existing ones to solve real-world business pain points and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-find-ais-docker-moment&#34;&gt;How to find AI&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Docker moment&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve widespread application of AI technology, several aspects need to be addressed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
Currently, many AI applications remain experimental and lack large-scale practical implementation. While areas like AI customer service and intelligent recommendations are widely used, their functionality is still limited and hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet overcome industry bottlenecks. True breakthroughs may come from industries long burdened by traditional methods—such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics—where AI can improve efficiency and reduce costs through more efficient data processing and predictive analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
Just as Docker improves operational efficiency by streamlining the containerization process, the usability of AI products is equally crucial. The popularization of AI isn&amp;rsquo;t just about technology; it’s about productization. Integrating AI into daily workflows and enabling users to easily utilize these tools without needing a deep understanding of the underlying technology is a key step in its successful implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
The widespread adoption of any new technology hinges on building a robust ecosystem. Docker&amp;rsquo;s rapid rise is due to its openness and compatibility, allowing developers to easily connect with various cloud platforms, tools, and services. Similarly, the future of AI depends on ecosystem development. Standardization, model sharing, data accessibility, and technical integration will all influence whether AI can achieve broad industry applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-the-future-of-ai-is-full-of-possibilities-but-still-requires-more-robust-implementation-plans&#34;&gt;Conclusion: The future of AI is full of possibilities, but still requires more robust implementation plans
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite significant advancements in AI technology over the past two years, it remains in a stage without a killer application. Similar to containerization technology before Docker&amp;rsquo;s release, AI needs a practical application scenario that deeply integrates existing technologies with business needs to achieve widespread adoption and scale. While technological innovation is important, solutions that simplify processes and improve efficiency are more likely to drive the popularization and development of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, AI may not revolutionize through groundbreaking technology, but rather create a perfect application scenario by integrating existing technologies—ultimately transforming how we work and live&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A dramatic market shift before and after National Day: soaring highs followed by plunging lows</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/national-holiday-stock-market-rollercoaster/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:42:26 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/national-holiday-stock-market-rollercoaster/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of China&amp;rsquo;s National Day holiday in 2024, the stock market saw a remarkable surge, followed by a dramatic plunge after the break. This &amp;ldquo;rollercoaster&amp;rdquo; experience for investors has prompted deep reflection on policy, economics, and market dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation: &amp;ldquo;Written as a news report, this blog post focuses on the stock market surge preceding last year’s National Day holiday, followed by the subsequent sharp decline after the holiday.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-surge-before-national-day-a-policy-driven-frenzy&#34;&gt;Stock market surge before National Day: A policy-driven frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the five trading days leading up to China&amp;rsquo;s National Day in 2024, the Chinese stock market surged from a slump into a &amp;ldquo;boiling&amp;rdquo; state. On September 30th, A-share markets saw broad gains with significant volume; major indices all reached historic highs. The Shanghai Index rose 8.06%, the Shenzhen Component Index climbed 10.67%, and the Growth Enterprise Market Index soared 15.36%. The B share index set a record for the largest single-day increase, jumping 22.84%. Market sentiment was extremely bullish, with daily turnover on Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing exchanges reaching 2.61 trillion yuan – a substantial increase of 1.1559 trillion yuan from the previous trading day. Over 5300 stocks across all markets rose collectively, creating a &amp;ldquo;sea of red&amp;rdquo; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving force behind this recent market rally stems from the concentrated release of a series of unexpected government policies and the resulting shifts in market expectations. On September 24th, the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China announced measures including cutting the reserve requirement ratio, lowering interest rates, reducing mortgage rates on existing loans, and unifying minimum down payment ratios for mortgages. The Central Political Bureau meeting on September 26th emphasized increasing counter-cyclical adjustments through fiscal and monetary policies to boost capital markets and encourage long-term funds to enter the market. On September 30th, a cluster of four real estate support policies were introduced. These measures demonstrate the government&amp;rsquo;s determination to stabilize the market and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-national-day-stock-market-plunge-calmness-and-adjustment-after-the-celebration&#34;&gt;Post-National Day Stock Market Plunge: Calmness and Adjustment After the Celebration
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, market sentiment plummeted after the National Day holiday. On October 8th, A-shares opened strongly with near limit-up gains, but following this sharp opening, the market experienced significant volatility, ultimately closing higher than it opened but lower than it closed. Since then, the market&amp;rsquo;s focus has continued to decline; as of October 16th, the Shanghai Composite Index saw a swing of over 15% and a cumulative drop of more than 470 points. From October 8th to 10th, core A-share indices across the board declined, with the Growth Enterprise Market Index falling by 6.21%.
This recent sharp decline is due to a combination of factors: digesting risks accumulated from previous rapid gains, and adjustments in market expectations regarding policy. Some investors believe the short-term effects of policies are already apparent, while long-term results remain to be seen. Volatility in overseas markets has also impacted A-shares. On October 9th, the Hang Seng Index plummeted 9.41% and the A50 futures contract fell 10.4%, further intensifying the market&amp;rsquo;s downturn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflection-on-and-prospects-for-the-market&#34;&gt;Reflection on and Prospects for the Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp market fluctuations before and after National Day have prompted deep reflection on policy, the economy, and market dynamics. While policy stimulus has shown a significant short-term effect, its long-term impact remains to be seen. The rapid market rises and falls also serve as a reminder for investors to remain rational and avoid emotional investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether A-share market can achieve a genuine &amp;ldquo;long-term bull&amp;rdquo; trend still depends on whether policies effectively reach the real economy and ultimately drive substantial improvements in economic fundamentals. Investors should closely monitor policy implementation and changes in economic data, adjusting their investment strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market&amp;rsquo;s surge and subsequent crash around National Day were a contest between policy and the market, as well as a test of investor psychology. This &amp;ldquo;extreme&amp;rdquo; volatility revealed both the power of the market and the influence of policy. We will see how the market unfolds next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Nezha breaks out during Spring Festival season</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-nizha-breakthrough/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:40:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-nizha-breakthrough/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For Chinese people, watching movies has become an essential entertainment during the Spring Festival season when families reunite. This year&amp;rsquo;s Spring Festival film releases were dominated by &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha,&amp;rdquo; which was incredibly popular and sparked widespread discussion. The buzz surrounding it is reminiscent of “Wolf Warrior,” both films carrying a strong patriotic theme that evokes a sense of national pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unexpected success of &amp;ldquo;Nezha&amp;rdquo; during the Spring Festival season, sparking a sense of national pride reminiscent of films like &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior,&amp;rdquo; demonstrates a patriotic theme. While acknowledging significant progress, the film isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as impressive as some claim. As a gamer, I find many aspects feel overly slick and the fight scenes lean heavily towards an MMO style. Numerous reports indicate people buying tickets to see it but ultimately not going due to its performance pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fight-scenes-lack-texture&#34;&gt;The fight scenes lack texture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a gamer, I usually spend my days immersed in online games and didn&amp;rsquo;t have high expectations for movies. But the buzz around &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; was undeniable; everyone was talking about it, so I figured I’d check it out. Once I entered the theater and saw the visuals, I felt a jolt. While the production quality has improved considerably, some scenes looked a bit greasy. And the fight sequences? They were too heavily influenced by online game aesthetics. Having played games for so long, this visual style is too similar to certain in-game environments, lacking the texture one expects from a film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crazy-movie-fans&#34;&gt;Crazy movie fans
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing the movie, I checked online and saw that quite a few people bought tickets for &amp;ldquo;The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Child&amp;rdquo; but didn&amp;rsquo;t actually watch it, all to boost its box office. That’s impressive dedication – clearly, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of enthusiasm for this film, and everyone wants to do something to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s recall &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; when Wu Jing shouted, “Whoever dares offend China will be punished no matter how far away they are,” many people were thrilled and felt that our Chinese military was so powerful, and our country so strong. While &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; doesn’t have such direct patriotic slogans, it vividly showcases traditional Chinese culture. We grew up listening to the stories of mythological figures like Nezha and Ao Bing; the film portrays their conflicts, love, and growth with depth and emotion – isn&amp;rsquo;t that the charm of Chinese culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Nezha. Misunderstood and looked down upon since childhood, yet he refused to give in, declaring &amp;ldquo;My fate is my own, not the heavens&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; That spirit is so much like the resilience ingrained in us Chinese people. No matter how great the difficulty, we don’t back down, but strive to change our destiny through effort. Ao Bing also exemplifies this – burdened by a family mission, seemingly cold but truly kind-hearted, willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. We often see such friendship and responsibility in real life, don&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advancement-of-animated-films&#34;&gt;Advancement of animated films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &amp;ldquo;The Devils Who Laugh&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, it effectively combines traditional Chinese culture with modern film technology, showcasing the progress of Chinese animation. Just as &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; demonstrated a breakthrough for Chinese cinema in action films, this kind of advancement gives us hope that Chinese movies can shine on the international stage and allow foreigners to appreciate the brilliance of Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chinese people, wherever we go, we carry our nation and culture in our hearts. Films like &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; are like keys, unlocking a sense of national pride deep within us. They allow us to experience the strength of our country and the charm of our culture amidst laughter and joy, inspiring us to work hard in our respective fields and contribute to the prosperity and development of our nation. This is likely why these films have become so popular and resonate with such strong feelings of national pride. We hope for more films like this in the future, to keep this sense of pride brimming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Making money takes time; rushing it wont help</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:30:24 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on years of stock trading, while I haven&amp;rsquo;t made a fortune, I also haven&amp;rsquo;t lost too much. The biggest issue is an unreasonable cash flow plan and unstable mindset. Currently, my primary income comes from work – a fixed salary. My tolerance for financial fluctuations remains at the level of bonds and bank deposits. However, people are inherently greedy; buying too little means you won’t profit when prices rise, while buying too much leads to losses when they fall. A stable mindset is therefore crucial; it helps steady our ship of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing through stock trading: The importance of mindset&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-loss-cases&#34;&gt;Historical Loss Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides dabbling in small-cap and newly listed stocks when I first started, the investments I&amp;rsquo;ve focused on since have been primarily blue-chip large-cap stocks: Industrial Bank, China Unicom, Hengan Electronics, ZTE, and various large-cap index funds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it stemmed from greed wanting more—rushing to increase holdings at the start, then facing a cash flow crisis. Expenses like insurance, buying property, and getting married were major drains on funds; the overall plan lacked sufficient financial buffer, leading to later shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy blue-chip stocks, it&amp;rsquo;s like relying on [someone] dependable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Evergrande ran into problems, bank stocks plummeted, allowing for a successful opportunity to sell off. However, this demonstrates a flawed understanding of the broader economy – real estate&amp;rsquo;s share in the national economy is too significant, with far-reaching implications that cannot be ignored. The subsequent market decline and the sustained rise of dividend stocks over roughly two years reflect this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The early stages of the trade war saw significant damage, with stock prices falling sharply, but they gradually recovered afterward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This stock belongs to the former employer. After Ant Financial&amp;rsquo;s divestiture, the price dropped significantly, but it has market makers who can push it up several times a year. With proper position sizing, losses will be minimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;greed-the-monster-that-devours-reason&#34;&gt;Greed: The &amp;ldquo;monster&amp;rdquo; that devours reason
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When stock prices rise steadily and investors&amp;rsquo; paper profits increase, greed quietly takes root. Many, seeing prices already at high levels, still fantasize about continued upward trends and seek greater returns, unwilling to take profits. Blinded by greed, they forget market rules and the existence of risk. For example, during speculative surges in certain hot-topic stocks, some investors, witnessing short-term doubling or even multiple times increases, become deeply involved, continuously adding positions with the hope of being the last winners. However, markets don&amp;rsquo;t stay exuberant forever; when bubbles burst and prices plummet, these greed-driven investors often suffer heavy losses. Greed robs them of their ability to analyze and decide rationally, turning them into &amp;ldquo;gamblers&amp;rdquo; rather than wise investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-shackles-binding-your-hands-and-feet&#34;&gt;Fear: Shackles binding your hands and feet
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is the opposite of greed. Fear is equally destructive in the stock market. When market conditions turn sharply downward and prices plummet, investors easily panic. This fear erodes their confidence; even with fundamentally sound stocks, they rush to sell to avoid further losses. For example, during the global financial crisis, many high-quality blue-chip stocks also fell dramatically. Some investors, overwhelmed by fear, failed to recognize the long-term value of these companies and sold their shares at rock-bottom prices, missing out on substantial returns from subsequent market rebounds and company performance growth. Fear not only causes short-term losses but can also create a lasting psychological shadow, deterring them from re-entering the market and causing them to miss investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blindly-following-trends-a-fog-that-obscures-direction&#34;&gt;Blindly following trends: A &amp;ldquo;fog&amp;rdquo; that obscures direction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blindly following the crowd is another common psychological trap for investors in stock trading and wealth management. In an era of information overload, investment advice, market rumors, and trending news abound. Many investors lack independent thinking and judgment skills, blindly imitating others&amp;rsquo; actions. Seeing others profit from buying a particular stock, they rush to buy without careful consideration; hearing so-called &amp;ldquo;insider tips,&amp;rdquo; they invest everything they have. This blind following neglects the necessary research and analysis of individual stocks, leaving investors lost like ships in fog, losing their direction. For example, some concept stocks may generate short-term gains for followers initially, but as hype fades, prices plummet, turning those unaware and blindly following into &amp;ldquo;bag holders.&amp;rdquo; They fail to realize that each investor has different risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizons; what works for others might not work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overconfidence-a-hidden-shoal&#34;&gt;Overconfidence: A Hidden &amp;ldquo;Shoal&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence is a significant issue in the mindset of stock and financial investments. After experiencing initial investment successes, some investors become inflated with pride, believing they have mastered market patterns and can accurately predict price movements. They disregard the complexity and uncertainty of the market, leading to excessive trading, blindly expanding their investment scale, and even using high leverage for speculation. However, the market is unpredictable, and overconfident investors often suffer significant losses from unexpected market fluctuations. For example, inexperienced but initially successful investors may believe they possess professional investment skills and begin frequent buying and selling while continuously increasing their investments. When systemic risks or negative news about individual stocks emerge, they fail to stop their losses in time due to their overconfidence, resulting in substantial capital erosion. Overconfidence is like a submerged reef, appearing calm and harmless on the surface but capable of wrecking an investor&amp;rsquo;s financial ship unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-for-sound-financial-management&#34;&gt;How to adjust your mindset for sound financial management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a correct investment philosophy: Investors should understand that stock trading and wealth management are for the long-term, stable growth of assets, not for getting rich quick. Through learning investment knowledge, understanding market patterns, and adopting value investing and long-term investment principles, avoid being swayed by short-term gains and market sentiment. For example, thoroughly research a company&amp;rsquo;s fundamentals – its profitability, industry position, management team, etc. – to select stocks with long-term investment value, rather than blindly chasing short-term trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a sound investment plan: Based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals, create a scientific and reasonable plan. Clearly define key elements such as investment amount, timeframe, expected return, and stop-loss point, and adhere to the plan strictly. This helps avoid impulsive decisions driven by emotional fluctuations. For example, limit each stock&amp;rsquo;s allocation to a certain percentage of your total assets; take profits when prices reach your target gains, and cut losses decisively when they hit your stop-loss level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control your emotions and stay calm: When facing market volatility, learn to manage your emotions and remain calm and rational. Relieve investment pressure through methods like distraction, exercise, and communication. Avoid letting emotions negatively impact your investment decisions. When the market experiences significant fluctuations, first calmly analyze the reasons, combine your investment strategy with the fundamentals of the stocks, and make a rational judgment instead of blindly following trends or panicking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous learning and reflection are essential in the ever-evolving stock market. Investors must consistently acquire new knowledge and skills, stay informed about macroeconomic trends, industry developments, and company information to improve their investment capabilities. Regularly reflecting on investment behavior, summarizing lessons learned, identifying issues with mindset and decision-making, and making timely adjustments are also crucial. For example, after each investment, review the entire process, analyze successes and failures, and consider how to avoid similar errors in future investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in the stock market is a long and challenging journey where mindset plays a crucial role. Maintaining rationality, composure, humility, and independent thinking are essential for navigating market volatility and achieving wealth preservation and growth. Investors should consider cultivating a positive mindset as a fundamental part of their investment process, enabling them to steer their financial future successfully.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Alternative fantasies and emotional attachments shaped by time</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</link>

        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/years-of-settling-alternative-fantasy-and-emotional-attachment/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the earliest online literature readers enter middle age, the genre has evolved. Protagonists now frequently appear as fathers, mentors, or elderly individuals, catering to middle-aged readers&amp;rsquo; changing needs for life and emotion. These works no longer solely focus on leveling up and defying the odds; instead, they emphasize emotional resonance and life reflections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;target-audience-evolving-readership-over-time&#34;&gt;Target audience: Evolving readership over time
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former online literature readers are now mostly middle-aged. Having experienced life&amp;rsquo;s challenges, their perspectives and values have shifted. The youthful pursuits of action and adventure no longer hold the same appeal. Instead, they seek emotional resonance with their current lives, memories of past years, and hopes for the future through reading. Middle-aged &amp;ldquo;爽文&amp;rdquo; (refreshing/satisfying novels) emerged to meet this psychological need, attracting readers with storylines that closely reflect the realities and mindset of middle-aged individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;character-transformation-from-young-hero-to-middle-aged-responsibility&#34;&gt;Character Transformation: From Young Hero to Middle-Aged Responsibility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After becoming a master, the protagonist Lu Zhou faces a group of apprentices with diverse personalities and formidable strength. They waver between good and evil, while Lu Zhou must guide them towards righteousness. This novel explores the challenges and dilemmas faced by a middle-aged person teaching the next generation through interactions between the protagonist and his apprentices. The growth and transformation of these apprentices also offer readers hope and a glimpse into the future, reflecting their own expectations for their children or younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emotional-resonance-reflections-on-life-and-family-responsibility&#34;&gt;Emotional Resonance: Reflections on Life and Family Responsibility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protagonist gains a system on their 60th birthday, embarking on a new life journey. This premise resonates with middle-aged readers by offering a sense of &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not too late&amp;rdquo; hope and inspiration. Despite reaching old age, the protagonist can still realize their value and dreams through the system. This storyline prompts reflection on missed opportunities and unfulfilled aspirations, while also conveying a positive attitude towards life, encouraging people to pursue their goals at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot-design-reflecting-the-rhythm-and-fun-of-middle-aged-life&#34;&gt;Plot design: Reflecting the rhythm and fun of middle-aged life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plots in mid-life &amp;ldquo;refreshing&amp;rdquo; novels often focus more on life&amp;rsquo;s details and nuanced emotional expression. Unlike the fast-paced leveling and adventure common in younger works, they prioritize relationships and emotional conflicts between characters. For example, in &amp;ldquo;Strongest Master,&amp;rdquo; the detailed portrayal of the master-apprentice bond and brotherhood among peers resonates with readers, evoking feelings of warmth and familiarity—a reflection of their own familial, friendly, and romantic experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Mystery of Spring Festival Movie Ticket Prices: Differences Between Online and Offline Sales</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/spring-festival-movie-tickets-price-mystery-online-vs-offline/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:02:02 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/spring-festival-movie-tickets-price-mystery-online-vs-offline/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the Spring Festival, a family of seven or eight wanted to see a movie. We planned to buy tickets on Taopihao and Maoyan, but saw the price was 60 yuan. Luckily, we had a cinema recharge card that required purchasing tickets at the front desk in person. Thinking to ask about any discounts, we were surprised to find the same showing only cost 35 yuan there – quite a difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hidden-platform-fees&#34;&gt;Hidden platform fees
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While online ticketing platforms offer convenience, their service fees are significant. They invest in user-friendly features like seat selection and purchase history tracking, which require funding. These costs are passed on to the customer through service fees, resulting in higher ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cinema-differentiation-strategies&#34;&gt;Cinema Differentiation Strategies
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand for movie tickets during the Spring Festival is surging, and theaters are using tiered pricing to maximize profits. Online platforms have high traffic, so many people buy tickets in advance online, resulting in higher prices for those tickets. Meanwhile, walk-in customers buying at the front desk receive lower prices to attract them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pricing-logic-behind-profit-sharing&#34;&gt;The pricing logic behind profit sharing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online platforms and cinemas cooperate through revenue-sharing models that affect ticket prices. To ensure profitability, platforms take a percentage of the box office, leading to higher ticket costs. Cinema counters, without intermediary fees, offer more affordable tickets due to lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips-for-buying-tickets&#34;&gt;Tips for Buying Tickets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t just look at online platforms when buying tickets. Try calling the cinema directly or visiting the front desk – you might find a surprise. If you’re a frequent moviegoer, consider getting a membership card to enjoy member discounts and save money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>An Analysis of Political Elements in 2025 Spring Festival Films</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-new-year-films-2025/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:49:42 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/political-elements-in-chinese-new-year-films-2025/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I went out during Spring Festival season, but this time I saw two movies and had a different feeling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the new trends in the 2025 Spring Festival film season, focusing on &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;New Deity: The Magchild Incites the Sea.&amp;rdquo; The former uses the backdrop of San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown in 1900 to depict the discrimination and oppression faced by Chinese people, reflecting the social and political environment. The latter, as an animated film, employs rich metaphorical elements to satirize the current international political landscape—for example, Jade Pure Palace resembling the Pentagon alluding to the American political system, dollar signs on the Tianyuan Cauldron symbolizing US dollar hegemony, the Immortal Jade Tablet mirroring the green card suggesting hierarchical status, and the Soul-Destroying Pill akin to biological weapons hinting at malicious actions. Both films offer a new viewing experience and prompt reflection on the relationship between cinematic art and political expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovation-in-spring-festival-film-styles&#34;&gt;Innovation in Spring Festival film styles
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Spring Festival films have been lighthearted and family-friendly, aiming to help audiences relax during the holiday season and rarely addressing sensitive political topics. However, this year&amp;rsquo;s 2025 Spring Festival lineup breaks with convention; &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;New God of War: Nezha Revolution&amp;rdquo; incorporate rich political elements, sparking widespread discussion among viewers and ushering in a new era for Spring Festival films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-vivid-reflection-of-the-eras-politics&#34;&gt;A Vivid Reflection of the Era&amp;rsquo;s Politics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Lost Tiger&amp;rdquo; is set in 1900 San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown, a time when Chinese immigrants faced severe racial discrimination and oppression. As the protagonists investigate a case, they must navigate not only the mystery but also societal prejudice and unfair treatment. The film’s portrayal of racism and power struggles realistically reflects the social and political climate of the era, revealing the arduous struggle for survival and dignity undertaken by Chinese immigrants during that turbulent time—a situation with underlying political issues worthy of deeper consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This historical context inevitably brings to mind the current challenges faced by overseas Chinese in the business world, such as the TikTok and Zhou Shuzhong incident&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 6, 2024, local time, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected TikTok&amp;rsquo;s request, upholding the constitutionality of a law requiring its sale on national security grounds. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew wrote in a memo to employees that the next step will be &amp;ldquo;seeking an injunction and awaiting review by the U.S. Supreme Court.&amp;rdquo; The event stems from the “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications” law, which mandates that ByteDance divest its U.S. TikTok operations within 270 days of the bill&amp;rsquo;s passage, with a final sale deadline of January 19, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Shou Zi Chew faced numerous challenges at various hearings. On January 31, 2024, during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on &amp;ldquo;Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis,&amp;rdquo; prominent anti-China lawmaker Tom Cotton repeatedly questioned him with 8 nationality-related inquiries, including his own citizenship, whether he had applied for Chinese or American citizenship, and even the nationalities of his wife and children. Despite the hearing&amp;rsquo;s focus being on online child sexual exploitation, the senator shifted the topic to TikTok’s ownership by the Chinese company ByteDance, forcing Chew to answer questions unrelated to the theme. Similar to the unwarranted discrimination faced by Chinese in &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900,&amp;rdquo; Shou Zi Chew is experiencing unfair treatment and scrutiny in the business world due to TikTok&amp;rsquo;s background. These events reflect that overseas Chinese have consistently encountered significant external obstacles when pursuing their own development and protecting their rights across different eras. Whether it was racial discrimination a century ago or today’s political maneuvering in commerce, these situations warrant deep reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-analysis-of-the-political-metaphors-behind-ne-zha-the-demon-child&#34;&gt;An Analysis of the Political Metaphors Behind &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha: The Demon Child&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While appearing as an ordinary animated film, &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha: The Demon Child&amp;rdquo; is rich with political allegories in its settings and plot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jade Void Palace is portrayed as the supreme power center of the realm, with an architectural style similar to the Pentagon, predominantly white in color, symbolizing Western powers using &amp;ldquo;universal values&amp;rdquo; as a pretext for hegemony. The “Demon Eradication Team,” led by the Limitless Immortal Elder, and its subordinates, Lù Nán and Hè Nǚ, are seen as corresponding to the US alliance system involving Japan and South Korea. The Jade Void Palace’s “online meeting” scene, with the Twelve Golden Immortals discussing the &amp;ldquo;War of the Conferred Gods,&amp;rdquo; mirrors a NATO summit led by the United States, ostensibly maintaining order while suppressing other nations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Tianyuan Cauldron, used for alchemy in Yuxu Palace, features dollar signs at its entrance, symbolizing how the United States &amp;ldquo;alchemizes&amp;rdquo; resources from other nations through economic hegemony. In the film, Wuliang Xianweng throws the dragon clan into the cauldron under the guise of “acting on behalf of heaven,” mirroring certain countries exploiting others by leveraging &amp;ldquo;international rules.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nezha&amp;rsquo;s immortal identity jade pendant, with its color and design resembling the U.S. green card, symbolizes the celestial realm’s exclusion and stratification of “outsiders,” hinting at the identity differences and unequal treatment between different countries and groups in reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The forced consumption of the Soul-Destroying Pill by Nezha, compelled by the Immortal Wonderman, resembles a bioweapon and satirizes certain nations that, under the guise of &amp;ldquo;saving the world,&amp;rdquo; engage in destruction and devastation abroad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Seven-Colored Treasure Lotus, crucial for reshaping the bodies of Nezha and Ao Bing, symbolizes energy and technology lifelines monopolized by powerful nations. Obtaining its “essence” requires passing the Yu Xu Palace’s “immortality exam,” reflecting developing countries&amp;rsquo; dependence on core resources and exploitation within a hegemonic system. The lotus’s temporary failure and recovery conditions allude to small nations’ survival challenges amidst energy crises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-deep-reflection-on-film-art-and-political-expression&#34;&gt;A Deep Reflection on Film Art and Political Expression
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These films, integrated with political elements during the nationwide Chinese New Year moviegoing boom, offer audiences a new viewing experience—no longer just entertainment, but more like a mirror reflecting political issues within history and reality. This prompts deeper reflection on the relationship between cinematic art and political expression. Will directors increasingly convey their views on society and politics through film? Can cinema, as a powerful cultural medium, balance artistic expression with greater attention to and contemplation of social realities? These questions warrant thorough exploration while enjoying films, and we look forward to more exciting developments from the film industry in fusing art and reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-egg&#34;&gt;Easter egg
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Doutou large language model wasn&amp;rsquo;t very reliable today – it froze several times, got stuck halfway through an article, and I had to start a new session&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The two major U.S. political parties—the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:40:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Democratic and Republican parties have significant differences in political ideology, policy proposals, and social values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;political-ideology-and-policy-proposals&#34;&gt;Political Ideology and Policy Proposals
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Party leans liberal, advocating for government involvement in economic and social matters. It supports social welfare programs, environmental protection, and multiculturalism. On taxation, the party favors tax cuts for low-to-middle income groups while raising rates on high earners and corporations. Regarding social issues, it supports abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and strict gun control. In foreign policy, the Democratic Party emphasizes multilateralism and diplomacy, preferring to resolve global issues through international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party leans conservative, advocating for limited government intervention and emphasizing individual freedom and a market economy. On tax policy, they support across-the-board tax cuts, believing they should benefit all income levels. Regarding social issues, they oppose abortion and same-sex marriage and support the right to bear arms. In foreign policy, they tend towards a hawkish stance, supporting the use of military force to protect national interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-significance-of-trumps-rise-to-power&#34;&gt;The significance of Trump&amp;rsquo;s rise to power
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s re-election as U.S. President in 2024 signifies the Republican Party’s dominance in American politics. Trump’s policy positions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump advocates for economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation, particularly supporting the development of traditional manufacturing and energy industries. He also favors protectionist trade policies, renegotiating or withdrawing from existing trade agreements to protect American economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump plans to strengthen border security, restrict illegal immigration, and impose stricter screening and limitations on legal immigrants. He also supports limiting refugee and asylum claims to protect national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump favors unilateralism, emphasizes &amp;ldquo;America First,&amp;rdquo; reduces reliance on international organizations, reassesses relations with allies, and employs tougher diplomacy when necessary. He also plans to expand fossil fuel production and usage while easing environmental restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second Trump term could lead to significant shifts in US domestic policy and have far-reaching impacts on global politics and economics. His policies are likely to draw international attention and responses, particularly regarding trade, environment, and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>DeepSeek unexpectedly surged before the Spring Festival, causing Nvidia stock to plummet: Institutional maneuvering and large model reasoning chains</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-drop-institutional-operations-large-language-model-chain/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:36:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/deepseek-chinese-new-year-nvidia-stock-drop-institutional-operations-large-language-model-chain/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the Spring Festival, DeepSeek quickly became a hot topic, garnering widespread attention on social media in just a few days. This sudden surge not only surprised many but also triggered a market chain reaction. Simultaneously, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock plummeted, raising concerns about its future and prompting significant short-selling activity from some institutions, suggesting a potentially orchestrated scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is an AI-powered tool focused on optimizing deep learning models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and image generation. In the days leading up to Chinese New Year, the project unexpectedly gained significant attention from investors and technical professionals. The team&amp;rsquo;s performance and demonstrated technological achievements have sparked considerable interest. Discussions about DeepSeek dominate tech circles across developer communities and social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s sudden surge in popularity wasn&amp;rsquo;t accidental. Analysis suggests potential involvement from certain institutions. Notably, Nvidia’s stock price has since seen a clear decline, indicating some factors are driving this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-1&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, a leading manufacturer of graphics processing units (GPUs), has long been a key hardware provider for large language models and AI computing. While the company&amp;rsquo;s stock has consistently performed strongly alongside the rapid growth of the AI market, it recently experienced a sharp decline following DeepSeek’s surge in popularity and increased market attention to its technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon may involve short-selling strategies by institutional investors. In recent years, as AI technology has become widespread, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock price has been highly inflated, leading many investors to believe its valuation is overhyped. Particularly after the surge in popularity of DeepSeek, some institutions may have profited handsomely by shorting Nvidia’s stock. These institutions successfully capitalized on precise market timing and an understanding of DeepSeek’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-2&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In traditional AI applications, many practitioners and investors focus on the &amp;ldquo;results&amp;rdquo; of AI models—such as generated images or text. However, discussions surrounding DeepSeek reveal a growing recognition that the underlying reasoning chain behind large language models is the more valuable core element. Previously, we could only see model outputs; now, we need to understand their logic, algorithms, and how to optimize performance by adjusting these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in thinking represents a deeper consideration of AI research and application. Moving from simple &amp;ldquo;black box&amp;rdquo; operations to genuinely understanding the internal workings of models is prompting many technical experts and investors to re-evaluate the future direction of artificial intelligence. DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s popularity exemplifies this breakthrough, encouraging attention towards the entire model construction and optimization process, rather than just the final output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-3&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s sudden rise, Nvidia’s stock plunge, and the market manipulation behind it all appear to be part of a carefully orchestrated scheme. A deep understanding of large language model thinking chains reveals that applying AI technology isn&amp;rsquo;t just about superficial accumulation; it requires in-depth exploration and optimization of internal model logic. As technology advances, we may see more innovative tools like DeepSeek emerge, driving AI research and application to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon not only reveals the immense potential of AI technology but also prompts us to consider the underlying business competition and capital operations. The future market trends will be a continued focus of this interplay between technology and capital.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The esports industry has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, becoming a significant cultural phenomenon worldwide. Games like League of Legends (LOL) have not only provided players with competitive entertainment but also fueled capital investment, driving the development of various esports platforms and events. However, this trajectory is now entering a gradual decline alongside the influx of capital and the rise of the pan-entertainment industry. The rise and fall of Panda TV, as well as the competition between Douyu and Huya, mark the end of an era of &amp;ldquo;wild capitalism,&amp;rdquo; suggesting shifts in the favorable conditions for the esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-investment&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Investment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early esports industry had humble beginnings, particularly in China. Many players participated in competitions for games like StarCraft and Dota fueled by their passion. However, esports truly began to rise with the release and promotion of League of Legends. After League of Legends officially entered the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche community into part of mainstream culture. Especially starting in 2013, the LPL (Chinese professional league) steadily developed, making League of Legends the cornerstone of China&amp;rsquo;s esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 marked a turning point for the esports industry in China. The influx of capital transformed esports from simple competitions into a much larger ecosystem. Panda TV, as one example, became a product of excess capital. Founded with investment from Wang Sicong, Panda TV rapidly gained popularity by attracting viewers and users with its innovative content and substantial investments. However, this also exemplified the &amp;ldquo;barbaric&amp;rdquo; influx of capital – a relentless pursuit that often lacks patience and long-term vision. While significant short-term achievements were made through considerable financial and human resources, Panda TV ultimately declared bankruptcy in 2019 due to management issues and overreliance on capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fall of Panda TV did not lead to a decline in the esports streaming industry, but rather spurred the rise of platforms like Douyu and Huya. These two giants quickly became leaders in the esports sector, with increasingly fierce competition between them. Douyu initially gained prominence through livestreaming League of Legends professional matches and signing top streamers, setting a benchmark for esports broadcasting. Huya, by increasing investment in esports events and diversifying its platform, gradually narrowed the gap with Douyu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital played a significant role in this process. Bilibili successfully went public in 2018, and Huya also conducted an IPO that same year. The rapid flow of capital led to high industry concentration and intense competition between platforms for streamers and copyrights, resulting in a &amp;ldquo;capital war.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-convergence-of-pan-entertainment-and-esports&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Convergence of Pan-Entertainment and Esports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With increased investment in the esports industry, esports platforms are gradually diversifying their content. Esports hosts are expanding beyond game commentary and event streaming to include various entertainment formats such as singing, dancing, and interactive live streams. This has resulted in a richer content ecosystem centered around esports but incorporating diverse entertainment elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the trend towards broad entertainment has brought problems—the originally focused gaming culture of esports is gradually being marginalized, replaced by a trend prioritizing entertainment above all else. This shift has caused some viewers who were deeply passionate about esports culture to feel alienated, and capital is increasingly turning its attention to other entertainment sectors. Excessive investment and profit-seeking are blurring the essence of the esports industry, weakening the core value proposition centered on competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rise of short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and other pan-entertainment industries, capital has gradually shifted funds from esports to broader entertainment content. Consequently, giants like Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance are no longer solely reliant on esports projects for profit but have increased investment in areas such as film, music, and short videos. Notably, ByteDance&amp;rsquo;s rise, fueled by the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin, has overshadowed esports’ prominence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-league-of-legends-generational-shift-the-fading-era-of-dividends&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: League of Legends&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Generational Shift&amp;rdquo;: The Fading Era of Dividends
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since League of Legends entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has become synonymous with the esports industry, fostering countless professional players, teams, and events, and driving a massive esports ecosystem. However, over a decade later, as a leading project in Chinese esports, League of Legends is entering a stage of generational transition. Notably, its influence has been gradually declining in recent years, even showing signs of significant decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
The most noticeable change is a generational shift in the player base. Initially, esports&amp;rsquo; rapid growth was fueled by a large cohort of young players, many of whom became professional players or viewers thanks to League of Legends. This generation grew up during a period of &amp;ldquo;demographic dividend,&amp;rdquo; immersed in the game’s competitive appeal and driving industry expansion. However, as time passed, these players matured, entered society, and shifted their focus towards other aspects of life and careers. Simultaneously, younger generations show less enthusiasm for League of Legends, resulting in an evident age gap and declining interest within the esports audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
Despite numerous updates and revisions, League of Legends&amp;rsquo; content innovation is struggling to keep pace. Annual version updates, hero balance adjustments, and the introduction of new gameplay features have failed to fundamentally address players’ need for novelty. Simultaneously, the MOBA market is becoming saturated, and other game genres like Honor of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite have rapidly gained popularity, diverting a significant number of players away from League of Legends. This competitive landscape has left League of Legends perpetually in a “chaser” role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-what-is-the-future-of-the-esports-industry&#34;&gt;Conclusion: What is the future of the esports industry?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The esports industry is like a skyscraper that seemingly sprung up overnight. Excessive capital wanders within the internet sector, seeking the next opportunity, and esports has become one of their targets. Leveraging China&amp;rsquo;s demographic dividend, the industry achieved rapid success, but this success lacks a solid foundation. Over-investment in capital, talent shortages, and weak game content are all hindering healthy development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before college, I didn&amp;rsquo;t play many games. League of Legends accompanied a generation’s growth; I watched so many finals. As an outsider, comparing Chinese and Korean players—especially Faker—Chinese players always felt hesitant during major tournaments. I understand the psychological pressure on players, but after more than ten years of development in this industry, mental health should be prioritized by teams. However, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been, and gameplay still relies on players’ innate talent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>From Games to Family: Why We Gradually Drift Away from Virtual Worlds as We Grow Up</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:11:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What were the happiest times playing games – sneaking to play Tank Battle, Super Mario, and Contra on our family&amp;rsquo;s TV as a child, or secretly playing Age of Empires on our family’s computer with my cousin, or later in college, playing Devil May Cry and League of Legends with my roommates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childhood had no worries, and when you played, you were completely absorbed in it – a level of immersion that&amp;rsquo;s impossible to find again as an adult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As times change and society progresses, we who were once active in virtual worlds are gradually realizing that the game platform filled with joy and competition seems to be drifting away from our lives. The disconnection of game social links, accompanied by players&amp;rsquo; gradual departure, is not only due to technological advancements and the replacement of games themselves, but also because of a shift in our life’s focus. As we grow older, we become busy with marriage and having children, and the main thread of life gradually shifts from personal entertainment to family responsibilities. Today, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss the underlying reasons behind this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disappearance-of-gaming-socialization-a-tug-of-war-between-virtual-and-real-worlds&#34;&gt;The Disappearance of Gaming Socialization: A Tug-of-War Between Virtual and Real Worlds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many, games weren&amp;rsquo;t just entertainment during their youth; they were a social outlet. Popular online multiplayer games offered challenges and competition while connecting players worldwide, creating virtual communities. Playing dungeons and team battles with friends was part of life back then, as were late-night voice chats and sharing daily experiences – memories we cherish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with time, more and more players have found that this virtual social experience lacks lasting appeal. As games are updated and new platforms emerge, players increasingly find more interactive ways to socialize outside of gaming. In-game friendships gradually fade from view, and many previously active social connections within the game eventually dissolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;games-and-responsibility-a-shift-in-lifes-focus-after-adulthood&#34;&gt;Games and Responsibility: A Shift in Life&amp;rsquo;s Focus After Adulthood
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entering adulthood, responsibilities gradually increase. Many young people once invested significant time in games, but with the start of their careers or shared living/family formation, these previously essential leisure activities are squeezed by life&amp;rsquo;s obligations. Marriage, having children, and even caring for parents – these major responsibilities require choices regarding energy and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming has become a thing of the past, replaced by the prioritization of family life. Many young people who once &amp;ldquo;struggled&amp;rdquo; in games are gradually realizing that real-life is the most important matter. Especially after having children, the focus of their lives shifts completely to family, and gaming is pushed to the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-games-to-family-how-changes-in-life-affect-our-entertainment-choices&#34;&gt;From Games to Family: How Changes in Life Affect Our Entertainment Choices
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our life experiences, family is one of the most important components. Once entering family life, time and energy become more specific and limited. To care for children and spend time with their partners, many young parents find they no longer have enough time to focus on games they once loved. Sometimes, they even lose interest in game updates and new releases. Gradually, social media platforms and offline interactions with friends and family become the preferred way for many people to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we’ve completely abandoned entertainment, but rather chosen ways more suitable for our current life stage. Many friends who used to connect through games may now maintain contact via other means—family gatherings, meals together, or short trips—due to diverging life paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;farewell-to-the-virtual-world-how-do-we-view-this-shift&#34;&gt;Farewell to the virtual world: How do we view this shift?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many who once immersed themselves in gaming, saying goodbye to game-related social connections isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. That virtual world, which brought us joy and a sense of accomplishment, has become part of our memories. However, farewell doesn’t mean severing ties completely; it means making different choices as life changes, balancing our roles in the real world. As we mature from youthful boys to responsible adults, while games still hold value, they can no longer be the main theme of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this shift reflects a facet of human adaptability—our ability to adjust our focus and lifestyle according to different stages. When responsibilities and family become central to life, gaming socialization is no longer a priority but rather an occasional pastime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-games-may-usher-in-another-wave-of-sense-of-belonging&#34;&gt;Future games: may usher in another wave of &amp;ldquo;sense of belonging.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, with social development and technological advancements, the forms and content of games are constantly evolving. For example, modern online multiplayer games are increasingly moving towards more relaxed and flexible approaches, and some even prioritize family interaction and parent-child relationships. In the future, we may see more game formats that better integrate into family life and provide players with healthier, more balanced social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as many people still feel nostalgia and passion when talking about &amp;ldquo;childhood games,&amp;rdquo; perhaps we, in the future, will also unexpectedly revisit those past games, bringing new understanding and experience, and re-enter that virtual world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-is-changing-but-love-remains&#34;&gt;Life is changing, but love remains
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s games or family, life’s changes consistently accompany our growth. We gradually realize that while virtual worlds offer endless joy and excitement, we ultimately return to reality, to the warmest place – home. There’s no need to regret leaving games, as each stage of life has its own unique meaning. These changes are what make us more complete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>County-level Brahmin: Big Shots in Small Towns</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:02:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, Teacher Da Bing has become very popular on Douyin. You often see accounts sharing clips from her livestreams. During one livestream, a listener asked, &amp;ldquo;Teacher Da Bing, I want to sell my house in Xi&amp;rsquo;an and return home to relax.&amp;rdquo; Da Bing replied, &amp;ldquo;At your age, in your thirties, you can’t just ‘lie flat.’ Your parents are aging, your children aren&amp;rsquo;t established yet, and even returning to your hometown, you’ll still have to deal with the complexities of a small county town.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether the view is right or wrong, what does this word mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many small county towns, people often talk about &amp;ldquo;county Brahmin&amp;rdquo; – their existence feels like a symbol of the local society. They are not necessarily religious figures or individuals with impressive titles, but rather seemingly ordinary yet influential people. They represent “power, status, and voice” in a small place, symbolizing a certain stratum within that county town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-1&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, we need to understand that &amp;ldquo;Brahmin&amp;rdquo; originally referred to the highest stratum of Indian society, representing wisdom, authority, and spiritual supremacy. However, in Chinese county towns, the term “county town Brahmin” lacks such complex religious connotations; it&amp;rsquo;s more a metaphor for a social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmin&amp;rdquo; refers to individuals who hold cultural authority within a county, such as teachers, doctors, prominent local merchants, and officials. Although their positions may seem ordinary, in the relatively closed environment of a county, they possess a comparatively high social status or, more accurately, considerable influence on local opinions and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-2&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the county town, almost every industry has these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins.&amp;rdquo; They might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Especially teachers with decades of experience in local areas, who may not be graduates of prestigious universities, but deeply understand how to build credibility through knowledge and are widely respected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Officials in county-level cities, such as deputy county commissioners and section chiefs, control certain resources and power. Despite their relatively low positions, due to the limited scope of their authority, they can become influential figures within their localities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Owners in some county-level cities, though their businesses may not be large, hold considerable wealth and local influence. They might run a couple of well-known small enterprises and have significant sway within the county.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These individuals, though not prominent compared to elites or officials in big cities, hold a status almost equivalent to &amp;ldquo;cultural elders&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;power centers&amp;rdquo; within this small county-level society&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-3&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the meaning of &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins,&amp;rdquo; we must consider the unique environment of county towns. Here, information flows more slowly than in big cities, and social mobility is relatively fixed. These &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; often gain influence through long-term engagement with the locality, accumulating reputation, knowledge, and networks. They impact various aspects of local politics, economy, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In smaller areas, particularly where the education system may not be well-developed and ordinary people have limited choices, local &amp;ldquo;Brahmin&amp;rdquo; figures subtly shape the cultural atmosphere through knowledge imparted in classrooms, media explanations, and even social interactions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the limited population and resources in county-level towns, these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; are often key controllers of local resources. Their influence is pervasive, affecting everything from social welfare and policy implementation to project approvals. Their power of speech and decision-making allows them to hold a significant position within the local community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a relatively closed small society, interpersonal relationships are often crucial. These &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; control the flow of information and allocation of resources by establishing strong social networks, allowing them to play a decisive role at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-4&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &amp;ldquo;county-level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; are often respected and revered, this elevated status is not without its problems. In modern society, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see that many of these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; in county towns may lack genuine ability and innovative spirit, instead maintaining their position through hereditary relationships and resource monopolies. With the development of informatization, their power is gradually being eroded, and new social mobility is beginning to reshape the landscape of small counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &amp;ldquo;County-Level Brahmins&amp;rdquo; is a fascinating social phenomenon that reflects the power and cultural structures within local societies. While their “power” may not directly threaten national governance, they are undoubtedly influential figures within their localities. In this era of rapid information flow and accelerating social change, these &amp;ldquo;Brahmins&amp;rdquo; in county towns may be facing unprecedented challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Art of Balancing Bank Marketing Strategies with Personal Financial Management</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 01:33:48 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/bank-marketing-personal-finance-balance/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, home renovations have significantly increased our daily expenses. We typically use credit cards and pay them off within the billing cycle. Although we have sufficient cash on hand, we prefer to keep it in money market funds for extra interest income. At the same time, to ensure financial stability, we’ve set up automatic payments to promptly repay credit card bills upon due date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-status-deposits-increasing-loans-decreasing&#34;&gt;Bank status: Deposits increasing, loans decreasing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst growing economic uncertainty, people are more inclined to save rather than consume or invest. This leads to increased bank deposits but also requires banks to pay higher interest rates. Conversely, reduced consumption and investment activity lowers loan demand, making it difficult for banks to generate income through lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attract and retain customers, banks are compelled to offer more competitive deposit rates, further compressing their net interest margins. Simultaneously, to stimulate economic growth and consumption, the central bank may implement policies to lower benchmark interest rates, which will also affect loan rates and subsequently impact bank profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bank-marketing-strategies-cultivating-user-habits&#34;&gt;Bank marketing strategies: Cultivating user habits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repayment is approaching soon. First, Bank of Communications offered me a one-year interest-free installment plan. Shortly after, China Merchants Bank provided a 2.5% discount on installment interest, resulting in an annual rate of just 1.9%. Faced with these offers, I chose to accept the installment services from both banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are truly investing heavily to cultivate user habits. According to the definition of a bank&amp;rsquo;s revenue stream, I should be considered a valuable client. Given the current difficulty in lending, banks are essentially preparing for potential future financial difficulties on my part by fostering my installment mindset—allowing them to earn more interest income when that time comes. After all, credit card interest rates are well-known to be high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and laid the groundwork for future profits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-personal-financial-management&#34;&gt;The importance of personal financial management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While bank installment offers may seem appealing, users should recognize the risks of over-relying on credit card installments. We should carefully consider our repayment ability and future financial needs to avoid falling into long-term debt for short-term convenience. Key to personal finance management is balancing current needs with future planning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The multifaceted nature of games: A convergence of psychological development and social entertainment</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 15:07:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, gaming has evolved beyond a simple form of entertainment and become an integral part of daily life. From a psychological perspective, games play different roles in the mental development of people across various age groups and are closely linked to social interaction and recreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-state&#34;&gt;Mental state
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people are in a stage of exploring themselves and establishing their identity, therefore games can allow them to try on different roles and lives, satisfying curiosity and the desire for exploration. As they age, personal interests and values gradually stabilize, and games may no longer align with their life goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes&#34;&gt;Social attributes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, gaming has become a social activity, especially for young people. They make friends and build social networks through games, which serve as a bridge for socializing. However, as people age, their social circles stabilize and social needs may be met through more mature means, diminishing the role of gaming in socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-a-girl-out&#34;&gt;Taking a girl out
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, due to a lack of relationship education, children are pressured to focus solely on academics by their parents, then immediately pushed into relationships upon graduation—a very common phenomenon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lacking stable emotional relationships due to busy schedules, work commitments, or a lack of social skills can lead to feelings of loneliness and a desire for attention. &lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, by helping and protecting female players, they experience a sense of being needed and valued, achieving emotional fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the game&amp;rsquo;s clear interaction rules and controllable environment offer certainty and a sense of security compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real life, reducing fears about unpredictable social interactions. However, prolonged reliance on virtual gratification within games may negatively impact their ability to form and maintain healthy emotional relationships in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reality-pressure&#34;&gt;Reality pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games offer a virtual world where players can temporarily escape the pressures, challenges, or unpleasant emotions of reality. This is particularly true for young people facing academic stress, family issues, or relationship difficulties, for whom games may be a way to seek comfort and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are often designed to provide players with a sense of accomplishment and recognition for completing tasks, leveling up, or defeating opponents. Young people may become addicted to games because they offer a feeling of being appreciated and acknowledged, which they may lack in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-getting-older-they-dont-like-playing-anymore&#34;&gt;After getting older, they don&amp;rsquo;t like playing anymore
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young, individuals face fewer social responsibilities and pressures, allowing more time and energy for gaming. As they enter the workforce and start families, increased responsibilities make time and energy more valuable, potentially leading to gaming being seen as a time sink rather than a preferred leisure activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, their cognitive abilities and interests evolve. What might appeal to someone in their youth—fast-paced, visually impressive games—may later give way to a preference for strategic, story-driven, or more complex experiences. If the market fails to meet these changing needs, interest will naturally decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Game Psychology: Competitive Games</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pay-to-win games are not discussed here. Within the gaming community, they&amp;rsquo;re commonly called &amp;ldquo;money warriors.&amp;rdquo; It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require understanding game mechanics, just a thick wallet. Their enjoyment comes from being surrounded by sycophants and the thrill of dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular competitive games like League of Legends, Dota 2, Honor of Kings, and PlayerUnknown&amp;rsquo;s Battlegrounds have established complete world-building and thriving esports ecosystems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In game design, psychology is a crucial field, and social psychology particularly so. Understanding people&amp;rsquo;s behavior, needs, and motivations can help create more engaging game experiences. Regarding the relationship between &amp;ldquo;showing off&amp;rdquo; (装逼) and social psychology, we can consider it from several perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often seek a sense of belonging within social groups. In games, if the design allows players to feel exceptional in some way and attract attention from others, it can enhance their social identity. This may manifest as showing off skills or displaying earned rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some games incorporate social competition elements, encouraging players to showcase their achievements on social networks. This can be achieved through leaderboards, achievement systems, or multiplayer battles. Such designs stimulate a competitive spirit among players and may lead some to perform exceptionally well for social recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some games allow players to express themselves through customized characters and virtual items. This self-expression is not just about showing off; it can also be a way to communicate individuality and socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some games emphasize teamwork, achieving game objectives through social interaction. In these contexts, showing off is often discouraged, with a focus on collaboration and mutual support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game design can incorporate psychological reward systems to encourage players&amp;rsquo; positive social behavior. For example, offering rewards or privileges to incentivize active participation in social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, social psychology in game design can be used to shape player interactions and social experiences. While &amp;ldquo;showing off&amp;rdquo; behavior may exist in certain situations, game designers typically strive to balance it to ensure a positive and engaging experience for all players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing as I think of things, without a complete outline—a bit messy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author frequently plays League of Legends, a game that represents the shared memories of our generation. Most parents disapprove of their children playing, often due to a lack of understanding and experience with this type of game – partly attributable to the game&amp;rsquo;s design, which offers a fresh start each match. For many children, it’s a self-directed exploration without excessive thought. Success or failure in this mode largely depends on the child&amp;rsquo;s innate gaming talent. Based on my own observations, a significant portion of players fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost isn&amp;rsquo;t money, it&amp;rsquo;s time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game also features an entertainment mode to cater to casual players&amp;rsquo; needs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, League of Legends is more about fulfilling a long-held wish and experiencing the joy of comebacks. There are also many &amp;ldquo;armchair gamers&amp;rdquo; who don&amp;rsquo;t play the game anymore but still watch the World Championship every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unavoidable to mention &lt;strong&gt;。指的不是单局游戏的时间，而是你上号的时间，周末的下午、每天工作日的晚上七点到晚上十点之间，你会发现和队友大部分情况都能正常沟通，你发出去的信号，队友能理解，能收到回应。换到其他时间，比如说通宵游戏，你碰到的更多就是&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;，顺风的情况，无事发生，逆风的情况下，他们能问候你的全家，隔着屏幕你都能感受到那股子&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in the IT industry, I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to and played a lot of games across various genres. When it comes to competitive gaming, I’ve always relied on strategy rather than raw reflexes; my natural aptitude is there. Compared to professionals or younger players, my reaction time is slower. My preference is to lead teams—taking control and directing the game. I started playing back in school, when we were guided by the older members of our guild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gaming environment now is quite restless, lacking the purity of before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After advancing to a higher grade, playing high-level matches is truly exhausting. It requires constant intense focus, analyzing your opponent&amp;rsquo;s strategies and figuring out how to counter their traps – it’s the kind of experience where you don’t want to play another game afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being truly good at gaming isn&amp;rsquo;t impactful for life’s trajectory unless you pursue it professionally. It can serve as a social tool, but won&amp;rsquo;t provide a livelihood or allow you to establish yourself in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-player games and online games are two distinct types of games with significant differences in gameplay, experience, and technology. Here are some key aspects to understand the distinctions between them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This game is played locally on your device and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require an internet connection. Players can enjoy the experience without a network connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These games typically require an internet connection as players interact with each other in real-time. Online games can be cooperative or competitive, involving online socializing and competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players primarily interact with in-game AI, preset missions, or adversarial elements. The gaming experience is typically more personalized and influenced by the game&amp;rsquo;s design and narrative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players can interact with other real players from around the world. This may include cooperating on tasks, competing against or alongside each other, and social elements like chat and guild systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game design emphasizes providing a complete, self-contained narrative and game experience. Game content is typically pre-designed, with players exploring, solving puzzles, or engaging in combat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game design must consider real-time interaction and competition or collaboration among players. Game content may be more dynamic, including regular updates, online events, and social interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It typically runs offline and has relatively low requirements for device performance and internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires a strong internet connection and high demands on server and network performance to ensure smooth real-time interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typically employs a one-time purchase or download commercial model, allowing players to fully play the game on their local device after purchasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game may adopt various commercial models such as free play, advertising, in-app purchases, or subscriptions to maintain server operations and continuously update game content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these distinctions helps players clarify their preferences when choosing a game, and enables game designers to better meet player expectations&lt;/p&gt;</description>
