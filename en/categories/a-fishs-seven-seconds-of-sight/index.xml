        <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2025 trade war tariff evolution showed a cycle of &amp;ldquo;escalation — retaliation — consultation,&amp;rdquo; shifting the US-China competition from tariff confrontation to rules-based competition. While short-term easing alleviated market pressure, long-term uncertainty remains; monitor the WTO rulings, supply chain adjustments, and geopolitical changes&amp;rsquo; continued impact on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People cannot earn money beyond their understanding. The stock market crash triggered by the trade war this year, even with a partial recovery now, has claimed countless retail investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timeline of Trade War Tariffs in 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of the 2025 trade war tariff timeline, incorporating key events from China, the US, and other countries to illustrate the evolution of tariff policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-april-2025-comprehensive-tariff-escalation-and-retaliation&#34;&gt;I. April 2025: Comprehensive Tariff Escalation and Retaliation

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration signed order 14257, announcing a 34% tariff on Chinese goods imported into the US, covering products from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The U.S. is further raising tariffs on China from 34% to 84%, and has signed Executive Orders 14259 and 14266, imposing additional tariffs on more goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The White House revised an executive order, raising the total tariffs on China to 145%, and increasing duties on small parcels (e.g., raising the tariff rate on goods under $800 from 90% to 120%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China announced a 34% tariff on all goods originating from the United States, covering sectors like agriculture, automobiles, and energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China will retaliate by raising tariffs from 34% to 84%, matching the US escalation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China is removing 91% of tariffs on US goods (corresponding to the portion agreed upon by the US) and suspending the implementation of 90% of the remaining 24% tariffs, while retaining 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US imposed a 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum products, prompting Canada to retaliate with tariffs on $2.98 billion worth of US goods and file a complaint with the WTO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The EU is imposing tariffs of up to 25% on US goods, while Japan expressed concerns over tariffs on US cars, calling the trade war &amp;ldquo;lose-lose.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;may-2025-geneva-talks-and-tariff-easing&#34;&gt;May 2025: Geneva Talks and Tariff Easing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China and the United States held 16 hours of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, resulting in the China-U.S. Geneva Trade Talks Joint Statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both sides announce suspension of some tariffs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US has suspended 24% of tariffs on China (for 90 days), retained 10%, and canceled additional duties scheduled for April 8th and 9th&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China will suspend 24% of retaliatory tariffs, retain 10%, and remove non-tariff measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both sides agreed to hold regular economic and trade consultations in China, the United States, or a third country, focusing on tariff reductions and rule-making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High tariffs are causing small and medium-sized enterprises to fail (e.g., Amazon sellers forced to close due to surging tariffs), and inflation expectations are rising (core PCE is projected to rise to 3.3%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China has tightened controls on rare earth exports, cracked down on smuggling, and impacted US military and new energy industries, forcing them to seek waivers for tariffs on key minerals like rare earths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canada and China have both filed disputes with the WTO against the US steel and aluminum tariffs and &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; alleging violations of the non-discrimination principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned that U.S. tariffs could cause a 1% decline in global trade volume by 2025, exacerbating the difficulties faced by developing countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 37-page list covers strategic materials such as rare earths, graphite, and medical CT tubes, exposing supply chain vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US imposed a 25% tariff on imported cars, leading to a projected 2% drop in global auto production and a 9% reduction in North America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration attempted to reshape the international trade order through &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; but was criticized as unilateral bullying, prompting a backlash from allies (such as the EU and Japan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China is responding to protectionism by expanding market access (such as through import fairs and zero-tariff commitments) to attract cooperation from developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;timeline-summary&#34;&gt;Timeline Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The US is imposing 34% retaliatory tariffs on China, covering goods from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The US will raise tariffs on China to 84% and introduce new tax orders&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;China retaliates with tariffs, initially 34%, later raised to 84%; US modifies tariffs to 145%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The US waived tariffs on some goods (like tech products), and China canceled 91% of its retaliatory tariffs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;China, US, and Japan Geneva talks result in a joint statement agreeing to suspend 24% tariffs (for 90 days)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Both sides announced suspension of tariffs and a consultation mechanism, easing trade tensions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trends-and-challenges&#34;&gt;Trends and Challenges
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tariff suspension between China and the US sends a positive signal, but structural issues (such as high technology and energy) remain, and midterm elections may affect policy continuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies are accelerating supply chain adjustments; Mexico and Southeast Asia benefit from &amp;ldquo;nearshoring,&amp;rdquo; but rising costs may curb recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is limited, and regional trade agreements (such as the US-UK agreement) have become alternative options, but this exacerbates fragmentation&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Jiangxi Provinces Special Post &amp; National Civil Servant Teacher Recruitment Data (2020-2025): Trends and Insights</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/jiangxi-specialized-post-and-national-cadre-teacher-recruitment-data-trends-and-transformation-insights-2020-2025/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Jiangxi Province&amp;rsquo;s teacher recruitment from 2020-2025 shows a significant reduction trend: Special post teacher hiring decreased sharply from 6,617 to 32 (a 99.5% decrease), and national cadre teachers dropped from 11,324 to 2,146 (an 81.1% decrease). While the proportion of core subjects (language, math, English) remained stable, the overall volume contracted. Though the proportion of arts, music, and physical education increased, absolute numbers were limited (e.g., only 2 recruits in 2025 for each subject). Policy shifts towards &amp;ldquo;one-in, one-out&amp;rdquo; staffing restrictions, with teacher resources directed toward vocational education and remote areas, have led to a substantial reduction in traditional primary and secondary school positions; some subjects had zero planned hires in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Celestial Realm of Medical Education and the Butterfly Effect of the Dong Xi-ying Incident</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-sky-dong-xiying-butterfly-effect/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 01:08:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/medical-education-sky-dong-xiying-butterfly-effect/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Peking Union Medical Center &amp;ldquo;4+4&amp;rdquo; program (4 years of non-medical undergraduate + 4 years of medical PhD), emphasizing interdisciplinary elite training, was exposed in 2025 due to the Dong Xiying incident. Her entry into the program allegedly leveraged family background (a lineage of medical professionals/researchers), raising questions about her educational qualifications and allegations of plagiarism. This highlights a conflict between the program&amp;rsquo;s elitist admissions practices and fairness, alongside unresolved issues regarding shortened training periods and supervised practice concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prompt&#34;&gt;Prompt
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog post: The origins and development of Concordia 4+4. Key points: A corner of Heaven, seen by mortals; Miss Dong&amp;rsquo;s family background; it’s impossible for a normal medical PhD to graduate in eight years; Miss Dong&amp;rsquo;s family and educational backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disintegrated-palace-of-medical-education-unionmed-44&#34;&gt;The Disintegrated &amp;ldquo;Palace&amp;rdquo; of Medical Education: UnionMed 4+4
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;4+4&amp;rdquo; program at Peking Union Medical College, launched in 2018, has been regarded as a “heavenly palace” for medical education in China. Designed to emulate the American medical education system and guided by the principles of attracting individuals with diverse backgrounds, cultivating those with a passion for medicine, and recruiting talent from across the globe, it seeks to break new ground within the traditional medical education framework. Its core logic lies in &lt;strong&gt;用4年非医学本科教育+4年医学博士培养，替代传统的5+3+3（本科5年+硕士3年+博士3年）模式&lt;/strong&gt;, aiming to cultivate leading medical professionals with interdisciplinary expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Celestial Palace&amp;rdquo; attribute is reflected in three dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially, applicants were required to have graduated from universities ranked within the top 50 by QS/Times/US News or among the top 10 US News liberal arts colleges (such as Barnard College). While later relaxed to include schools ranked in the top 100, a GPA of 3.6 or higher, or being in the top 30% of their class is still required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilizing an American organ-system integrated curriculum and PBL (Problem-Based Learning) teaching methods, students must complete core courses such as anatomy and pathology within four years, alongside clinical internships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the passing rate for the licensing exam (95.2%) was slightly lower than the traditional eight-year program (98.5%), graduates largely enter Peking Union Medical Center affiliated hospitals, and their career development shows no significant difference from the traditional path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dong-xi-ying-incident-cracks-in-heavenly-palace-seen-by-a-mortal&#34;&gt;The Dong Xi-ying Incident: Cracks in &amp;ldquo;Heavenly Palace&amp;rdquo; Seen by a Mortal
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, a report of extramarital affairs involving Dr. Xiao Fei, a thoracic surgeon at the Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital, unexpectedly exposed the &amp;ldquo;mystery&amp;rdquo; surrounding Peking Union Medical Center&amp;rsquo;s 4+4 project. The resume of the involved party, Dong Xiuying, raised three points of concern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;学历背景的模糊性&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Xiyi claims to have graduated from Columbia University, but in fact attended its affiliated Barnard College (ranked 14th by US News for liberal arts colleges in 2025). Although Barnard meets the &amp;ldquo;top 20 liberal arts college&amp;rdquo; requirement, its diploma simultaneously lists “Barnard College” and “Columbia University,” which can easily be mistaken for Columbia’s main campus in the domestic recruitment market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The path of a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in economics followed by a doctorate in clinical medicine, while meeting the &amp;ldquo;multidisciplinary background&amp;rdquo; requirement of the 4+4 program, has been questioned for lacking a foundation in pre-medical coursework. Furthermore, his doctoral dissertation, &amp;ldquo;Research on Multi-Modal Image Fusion Technology in Medical Image Analysis,&amp;rdquo; has been accused of significant similarity to a Beijing University of Science and Technology invention patent, raising concerns of academic misconduct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;家庭背景的特殊性&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His father is a secretary at China Metallurgical Research Institute, his mother is an associate dean at the Beihang University Engineering Technology Research Institute, his grandfather is an academician in the field of imaging at Peking Union Medical College, his maternal grandparents are foreign academicians in materials science, and his aunts and uncles are professors at Beihang University. This &amp;ldquo;medicine + research + university&amp;rdquo; family background provides him with hidden resources such as letters of recommendation (requiring two biomedical associate professors) and research collaborations (such as patents from Beihang University).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During residency, he switched from thoracic surgery to urology, with research spanning multiple fields including orthopedics, gastroenterology, and imaging, leading to accusations of &amp;ldquo;paving the way with resources.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;学制争议的放大&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional medicine doctoral programs require 11 years (5+3+3), while the 4+4 program compresses this to 8 years. Despite Peking Union Medical College&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on &amp;ldquo;integrated curriculum&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;early clinical exposure,&amp;rdquo; some doctors note that its clinical internship time (12 months) is less than the traditional eight-year system (18 months), potentially impacting skill development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some training bases allow a one-year reduction in required training for 4+4 graduates, raising concerns about fairness within the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dilemma-of-medical-education-behind-the-controversy&#34;&gt;The Dilemma of Medical Education Behind the Controversy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dong Xi-ying case reflects the deep-rooted contradictions in China&amp;rsquo;s medical education system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;精英化与公平性的冲突&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;application-review system&amp;rdquo; of the 4+4 program is essentially a transplant of the American medical school model, but China lacks standardized exams like the MCAT, and subjective evaluations such as letters of recommendation and research experience are easily influenced by family background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data shows that among the 2023 graduates (4+4 program), 30% came from Tsinghua, Peking University, and Fudan University, 25% from overseas prestigious universities, indicating a significant influence of family background on applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;学制改革的现实困境&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research output (e.g., publications) from 4+4 medical students is significantly lower than that of traditional eight-year programs, leading to criticism of prioritizing clinical experience over research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-tier hospitals prioritize the Peking Union Medical Center brand, while community hospitals are cautious about the clinical abilities of 4+4 program graduates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;医学教育的国际接轨之惑&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US 4+4 model requires passing the MCAT and completing 3-7 years of residency, while China&amp;rsquo;s 4+4 program simplifies admission and residency, resulting in a superficial resemblance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to data from the Ministry of Education, in 2024 nationwide medical doctoral program admissions, programs following the 4+4 model accounted for less than 5%, and their widespread promotion still faces challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reconstructing-the-celestial-palace-order-of-medical-education&#34;&gt;Reconstructing the &amp;ldquo;Celestial Palace&amp;rdquo; Order of Medical Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding the Union 4+4 project is fundamentally a clash between elite education and public expectations. When a corner of &amp;ldquo;heavenly palace&amp;rdquo; (referring to top-tier medical training) is glimpsed by ordinary people, it exposes not only flaws in individual cases but also deep-seated contradictions within the entire medical education system. Future reforms need to focus on three levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce standardized exams (like China&amp;rsquo;s version of the MCAT) to reduce the influence of subjective factors such as letters of recommendation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restore the internship period for 4+4 graduates to 3 years to ensure clinical competency standards are met&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish an academic integrity review mechanism, with rigorous originality verification for interdisciplinary research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical education should not be a privilege for a few, but a true incubator for medical excellence. Only when fairness in selection, rigor in training, and standardization of career development are comprehensively ensured can this &amp;ldquo;medical education experiment&amp;rdquo; truly take root.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Tariff storm, stock market crash</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/tariffs-storm-stock-market-crash/</link>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/tariffs-storm-stock-market-crash/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, global stock markets have experienced sharp volatility, largely due to new comprehensive tariff measures announced by U.S. President Donald Trump, sparking market concerns about a global trade war and economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump announced tariffs on all imported goods last week, with up to a 50% tariff on imports from China, aiming to correct what he called an unfair global trade system. This move triggered panic selling in global markets as investors worried that escalating trade tensions would stifle global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, major stock indexes suffered significant losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,200 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;amp;P 500 indices dropped 4% and 3.8%, respectively, entering bear market territory. Asian and European markets were also affected, with the Nikkei 225 in Japan falling nearly 8% and European stock markets declining by 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with market volatility, investors are shifting to safe-haven assets like bonds and the yen. However, a surge in the VIX to above 60 indicates escalating market panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists warn that tariff policies could lead to &amp;ldquo;stagflation&amp;rdquo; in the U.S. economy – a situation of stagnant growth, rising inflation, and high unemployment occurring simultaneously. JPMorgan Chase has raised the probability of a U.S. recession in 2025 to 60%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments worldwide have announced retaliatory measures. For example, the EU trade commissioner stated that they will begin imposing retaliatory tariffs on US goods on April 15th. Businesses have also expressed concerns; Goldman Sachs, for instance, has raised the probability of a US economic recession to 45%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, global markets are facing unprecedented challenges; investors need to closely monitor trade policy developments and market changes, while managing risk and allocating assets&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Nezha breaks out during Spring Festival season</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-nizha-breakthrough/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:40:07 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;For Chinese people, watching movies has become an essential entertainment during the Spring Festival season when families reunite. This year&amp;rsquo;s Spring Festival film releases were dominated by &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha,&amp;rdquo; which was incredibly popular and sparked widespread discussion. The buzz surrounding it is reminiscent of “Wolf Warrior,” both films carrying a strong patriotic theme that evokes a sense of national pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unexpected success of &amp;ldquo;Nezha&amp;rdquo; during the Spring Festival season, sparking a sense of national pride reminiscent of films like &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior,&amp;rdquo; demonstrates a patriotic theme. While acknowledging significant progress, the film isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as impressive as some claim. As a gamer, I find many aspects feel overly slick and the fight scenes lean heavily towards an MMO style. Numerous reports indicate people buying tickets to see it but ultimately not going due to its performance pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fight-scenes-lack-texture&#34;&gt;The fight scenes lack texture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a gamer, I usually spend my days immersed in online games and didn&amp;rsquo;t have high expectations for movies. But the buzz around &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; was undeniable; everyone was talking about it, so I figured I’d check it out. Once I entered the theater and saw the visuals, I felt a jolt. While the production quality has improved considerably, some scenes looked a bit greasy. And the fight sequences? They were too heavily influenced by online game aesthetics. Having played games for so long, this visual style is too similar to certain in-game environments, lacking the texture one expects from a film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crazy-movie-fans&#34;&gt;Crazy movie fans
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing the movie, I checked online and saw that quite a few people bought tickets for &amp;ldquo;The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Child&amp;rdquo; but didn&amp;rsquo;t actually watch it, all to boost its box office. That’s impressive dedication – clearly, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of enthusiasm for this film, and everyone wants to do something to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s recall &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; when Wu Jing shouted, “Whoever dares offend China will be punished no matter how far away they are,” many people were thrilled and felt that our Chinese military was so powerful, and our country so strong. While &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; doesn’t have such direct patriotic slogans, it vividly showcases traditional Chinese culture. We grew up listening to the stories of mythological figures like Nezha and Ao Bing; the film portrays their conflicts, love, and growth with depth and emotion – isn&amp;rsquo;t that the charm of Chinese culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Nezha. Misunderstood and looked down upon since childhood, yet he refused to give in, declaring &amp;ldquo;My fate is my own, not the heavens&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; That spirit is so much like the resilience ingrained in us Chinese people. No matter how great the difficulty, we don’t back down, but strive to change our destiny through effort. Ao Bing also exemplifies this – burdened by a family mission, seemingly cold but truly kind-hearted, willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. We often see such friendship and responsibility in real life, don&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advancement-of-animated-films&#34;&gt;Advancement of animated films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &amp;ldquo;The Devils Who Laugh&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, it effectively combines traditional Chinese culture with modern film technology, showcasing the progress of Chinese animation. Just as &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; demonstrated a breakthrough for Chinese cinema in action films, this kind of advancement gives us hope that Chinese movies can shine on the international stage and allow foreigners to appreciate the brilliance of Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chinese people, wherever we go, we carry our nation and culture in our hearts. Films like &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; are like keys, unlocking a sense of national pride deep within us. They allow us to experience the strength of our country and the charm of our culture amidst laughter and joy, inspiring us to work hard in our respective fields and contribute to the prosperity and development of our nation. This is likely why these films have become so popular and resonate with such strong feelings of national pride. We hope for more films like this in the future, to keep this sense of pride brimming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Eliminate interest rate caps on first-time and second-home mortgages for commercial banks nationwide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China’s provincial branches, following a city-specific approach, are guiding local lending rate self-discipline mechanisms. They will independently determine whether to set lower limits on interest rates for commercial personal housing loans in each city within their jurisdictions, based on the real estate market conditions and local government regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking and financial institutions should determine the specific interest rate for each loan, considering factors such as their own operational status, customer risk profiles, and any applicable lower interest rate limits set by provincial market rate pricing self-discipline mechanisms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-housing-provident-fund-loan-interest-rates-have-been-reduced-by-025-percentage-points&#34;&gt;Personal housing provident fund loan interest rates have been reduced by 0.25 percentage points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Shanghai Head Office, branches in each province, autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government, and separately planned cities; policy-oriented banks, state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and various joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China has decided to lower the interest rates for individual housing provident fund loans starting May 18, 2024. Rates for first-time home buyers will be adjusted to 2.35% and 2.85% for loans with terms of 5 years or less (including 5 years) and over 5 years respectively. Second-time home buyer rates will be no lower than 2.775% and 3.325% for the same loan durations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;down-payment-ratio-adjusted-to-no-less-than-15&#34;&gt;Down payment ratio adjusted to no less than 15%
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China (Shanghai Headquarters), branches in each province, autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government, and separately planned cities; all regulatory bureaus of the National Financial Regulatory Administration; state-owned commercial banks; Postal Savings Bank of China; and joint-stock commercial banks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, adapt to the new changes in housing supply and demand and people&amp;rsquo;s expectations for quality homes, and promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, please note the following regarding personal mortgage policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For residential families purchasing a first home through loans, the minimum down payment for commercial personal housing loans is adjusted to no less than 15%. For second homes, it&amp;rsquo;s adjusted to no less than 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this foundation, each provincial branch of the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China and each sub-branch of the National Financial Regulatory Administration will independently determine the minimum down payment ratio for first-time and second-home commercial personal housing loans in their respective jurisdictions, in accordance with local government regulatory requirements and the principle of city-specific policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-central-bank-will-establish-a-rmb-300-billion-affordable-housing-refinancing-program&#34;&gt;The central bank will establish a RMB 300 billion affordable housing refinancing program
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 4 p.m., representatives from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, and the National Financial Regulatory Administration convened at a regular policy briefing held by the State Council to introduce supporting policies related to ensuring housing delivery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, Vice Governor of the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Yao Ling announced that the central bank will establish a RMB 300 billion affordable housing refinancing facility to support local state-owned enterprises in acquiring completed but unsold commercial properties at reasonable prices for use as rental or share ownership affordable housing, which is expected to stimulate RMB 500 billion in bank loans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the central bank, affordable housing lending has a one-year term with up to four extensions and an interest rate of 1.75%. It is directed towards 21 nationwide banks, encouraging them to provide loans to local state-owned enterprises selected by cities to acquire completed but unsold commercial properties for use as affordable housing. These acquisitions are strictly limited to existing, unsold commercial properties from real estate developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China will soon release a notice regarding establishing affordable housing refinancing loans&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Starch-Wrapped Meat Snacks and Street Vendors: The New Influence of Capital</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/sausages-and-street-vendors-capital-news-influence/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 00:31:58 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/sausages-and-street-vendors-capital-news-influence/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In reality, 3/15 did not report on &amp;ldquo;chicken bone gel,&amp;rdquo; and this issue is confusing the CCTV 3/15 Gala&amp;rsquo;s official exposure with other simultaneous food safety incidents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-just-paste-the-text-here&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are! Just paste the text here.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 315 Gala highlighted nine manufacturers, but none were starch-filled sausages (淀粉肠). Now, the nominated brands have lost their buzz, while this focus on starch-filled sausages—a popular snack widely available across China—feels like a scapegoat. I traced the online news source to a CCTV report published on 3/15 investigating ham sausages, which simply listed ingredients from several manufacturers without issue. Then, a reporter claimed, based on hearsay from a factory employee, that chicken bone meal was sometimes used as a substitute for chicken meat. She then asked pet food retailers selling chicken bone meal if it&amp;rsquo;s safe for human consumption—a ridiculous question! A pet food vendor wouldn’t advise someone to eat it. This led to rumors claiming starch-filled sausages contained chicken bone meal, which is unsafe for humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, many factories are likely facing closure, and hundreds of thousands of small vendors across the country are on the brink of losing their livelihoods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reality-of-the-world&#34;&gt;Reality of the world
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a report by the Xiaoxiang Morning News on March 17th, on March 16th in Sanmenxia, Henan, the day after the &amp;ldquo;starch-tube collapse&amp;rdquo; incident, a vendor set up a stall selling starch tubes, but after two hours with no customers, she quietly ate them herself. The person filming said he normally eats four or five starch tubes at a time, but has stopped eating them entirely since learning about the chicken bone powder found inside. He was curious to see if anyone would still buy starch tubes after the exposure, and witnessed the vendor selling nothing in two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auntie has no idea about this tapioca sausage incident; she just knows that suddenly, nobody is buying her grilled sausages today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The older woman isn&amp;rsquo;t wrong; she’s just trying to support her family. She doesn’t even know if the product is faulty or qualified, nor does she understand what &amp;ldquo;bone glue&amp;rdquo; is. They are simply people at the bottom, struggling to survive without knowledge of the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The starch sausage collapsed, but those paying the bill are individual grassroots vendors. It&amp;rsquo;s a painful process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-just-paste-the-text-here-1&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are! Just paste the text here.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, one afternoon, a colleague who had moved from out of town and I went for lunch, passing by a street vendor selling grilled sausages and sliced steak on a hot plate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blurted out, &amp;ldquo;Do people even eat this kind of high-tech sausage and sirloin anymore?&amp;rdquo; Because in my mind, it had been nearly fifteen years since I last ate a processed meat stick like that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague hesitated, then gently said, &amp;ldquo;Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because you live in a big city. In my hometown, preserved vegetables, instant noodles, and sausage are everyday staples.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in school, my dad would only buy me a grilled sausage if I got a perfect score on my test. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t because they were unhealthy; it’s just that a sausage cost 1.5 yuan – enough to buy two pounds of vegetables instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard about calling instant noodles, carbonated drinks, and spicy-flavored fish snacks &amp;ldquo;junk food&amp;rdquo; after I started studying in Beijing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized the arrogance in my careless words and fell silent. However, this experience left a deep impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this is the daily life of most ordinary people in China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lives lacked fancy trends like the &amp;ldquo;Mediterranean diet,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;organic vegetables,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;non-GMO soybeans.&amp;rdquo; They only cared about whether they could afford some cheap and tasty vegetables, meat, and snacks, allowing their whole family to enjoy a few moments of happiness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the items on the shelves, their composition, whether they could harm their health, and if they contain any unusual chemical ingredients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was never something they should concern themselves with or understand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after watching the 315 gala, everyone realized that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market electronics scales and gas pumps at filling stations can be rigged with modified circuit boards, requiring content creators to risk physical harm filming evidence before authorities finally take notice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;health tonic&amp;rdquo; alcohol heavily promoted on TV channels and airport advertisements was abruptly removed and disappeared from public view after a video exposed its deceptive practices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is once a year enough to eliminate five or six products that have been sold for a long time through a lottery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where else would they go, those consumers who have already bought from us?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>East Meets West Controversy: A Clash of Culture and Commerce</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Select &amp;ldquo;Short Essay Incident&amp;rdquo; is a network controversy triggered by the company&amp;rsquo;s denial that Dong Yuhui was the author of all the short essays. The truth is now impossible to verify, and corporate power struggles have pushed this matter into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;seven-second memory&amp;rdquo; of fish is now entrusted to two options: the former provides more complete information, and search engines retrieve even more; however, the resulting blog posts are incomplete with a rigid format. The latter obtains content through keywords, which isn&amp;rsquo;t entirely comprehensive, but can generate complete blog post content. Providing reference URLs allows for optimization of the generated draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dong Yuhui/Oriental Selection incident is a dispute over copyright and authorship, beginning on December 5, 2023, involving interactions between the livestreamer Dong Yuhui and Oriental Selection. This controversy reveals the complexity of business operations and prompts deep reflection on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-5-2023-event-start&#34;&gt;December 5, 2023: Event Start
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Selection released a teaser video, and host Dong Yuhui&amp;rsquo;s recitation of a &amp;ldquo;short essay&amp;rdquo; quickly went viral&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongfang Zhenxuan stated in video comments that these short essays were mostly created by the copywriting team and not entirely written by Dong Yuhui&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-13-2023-dong-yu-huis-response&#34;&gt;December 13, 2023: Dong Yu Hui&amp;rsquo;s Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Yuhui published a lengthy article defending against stigmatizing anyone under the guise of &amp;ldquo;fancams&amp;rdquo; and clarifying his position on the matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-14-2023-managements-response&#34;&gt;December 14, 2023: Management&amp;rsquo;s Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Selection CEO Sun Dongxue released an apology video, admitting flaws in company management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Yuhui also received an apology from Dongfang Zhenxuan Chairman Yu Minhong, who responded to the incident&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-16-2023-major-decision&#34;&gt;December 16, 2023: Major Decision
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongfang Zhenxuan has announced that Sun Dongxu is no longer CEO, with Yu Minhong assuming the role concurrently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the same day, Yu Minhong issued an apology letter stating that blacklisted viewers would be unblocked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dong-yu-huis-new-role&#34;&gt;Dong Yu Hui&amp;rsquo;s New Role
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XDF Education &amp;amp; Technology Group has appointed Dong Yuhui as Cultural Assistant to the Chairman of XDF Education &amp;amp; Technology Group, and concurrently Vice President of XDF Tourism Group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yu Minhong revealed that he will partner with Dong Yuhui to establish a studio and launch new live streaming accounts and rooms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-and-reflection&#34;&gt;Conclusion and Reflection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This controversy is not only a dispute over copyright and authorship but also reflects the clash between culture and commerce. In this era of digitization and fragmentation, the ownership of content creation has become a topic worthy of deep consideration. The Oriental Select &amp;ldquo;short essay&amp;rdquo; incident is more than just a media storm; it&amp;rsquo;s a profound reflection on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As observers, how should we view this collision of culture and commerce? While pursuing commercial interests, how can we protect and respect the creators&amp;rsquo; labor? These are questions worthy of deep reflection for each of us&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The curtain-raising of financial anti-corruption</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Central Committee of the Communist Party: Efforts to combat corruption in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector must be intensified, and addressing the &amp;ldquo;four vices&amp;rdquo; should be deepened&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-politburo-of-the-communist-party-of-china&#34;&gt;The Politburo of the Communist Party of China
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held a meeting on September 27 to review a comprehensive report on the first round of inspections during the CPC’s 20th Central Committee term. General Secretary Xi Jinping presided over the meeting. The meeting emphasized leveraging the outcomes of the inspections to further strengthen the Party&amp;rsquo;s overall leadership, urging inspected organizations to enhance their political awareness and diligently fulfill responsibilities entrusted by the CPC Central Committee. It also stressed continuously strengthening the core functions and competitiveness of state-owned enterprises, solidifying the essential material and political foundations of socialism with Chinese characteristics, increasing the efforts of financial institutions in serving the real economy and national strategies, and promoting high-quality development. The meeting called for balancing development and security, establishing a baseline and extreme mindset, taking effective measures to prevent and resolve major risks, and firmly safeguarding the safety bottom line. It urged advancing the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party, tightening responsibility for Party committee secretaries as primary responsible persons, implementing “one post, two responsibilities” for members of leadership bodies, strengthening oversight responsibilities of disciplinary and supervisory organs, and intensifying supervision over leading figures at all levels. Efforts should be increased to combat corruption in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector, address issues related to &amp;ldquo;formality over substance,&amp;rdquo; and promote integrated prevention and cure through case-driven reform. The meeting also emphasized implementing the Party’s organizational principles for a new era, strengthening leadership team construction, cadre and talent development, and grassroots party organization building. It called for comprehensively utilizing the results of inspections to deepen reforms, improve systems, advance source governance, and achieve both fundamental and immediate improvements. (Xinhua)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Bank, Liu Liange, Expelled from the Party Amidst Significant Financial Risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and National Supervisory Commission, with the approval of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, Liu Liange, former party secretary and chairman of Bank of China, is under investigation for serious violations of discipline and law
After investigation, Liu Liange lost his ideals and beliefs, abandoned his original aspirations and mission, failed to resolutely implement the decisions and plans of the Party Central Committee, neglected his responsibilities in financial risk prevention and control, extensively interfered with credit projects in violation of regulations, illegally disbursed loans, creating major financial risks. He performed poorly in fulfilling the principal responsibility for strict governance on all fronts, severely damaged the political environment within his unit, secretly brought prohibited publications into the country, and deliberately resisted organizational inspections. He disregarded the spirit of the Central Eight-Point Regulation, accepting gifts and cash, entering private clubs, and receiving ski and travel arrangements; he long-term borrowed vehicles belonging to those he managed. He failed to report personal matters as required, provided false information during organizational inquiries, and improperly appointed, adjusted, or promoted cadres. He engaged in commercial activities illegally, intervened in lending and borrowing against regulations, and retained classified materials. His morals were corrupt, his family conduct was improper, and he failed to properly guide and educate his relatives. Demonstrating no legal bottom line, he abused his power for personal gain, “profiting from the financial sector,” using his position to seek benefits for others in areas such as loan financing and project cooperation, and illegally accepting large sums of money and property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu Liange seriously violated political, organizational, integrity, work, and lifestyle discipline. His actions constituted serious official misconduct and involved suspected bribery and illegal loan disbursement crimes. He showed no signs of restraint or correction after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, demonstrating a severe nature and detrimental impact. In accordance with regulations including the &amp;ldquo;Disciplinary Action Regulations of the Communist Party of China,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;Law on Supervision of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China,&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Regulations on Administrative Punishment of Civil Servants,&amp;rdquo; following deliberation by the Standing Committee of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and approval by the Communist Party of China Central Committee, it was decided to impose the disciplinary action of expulsion from the Party. His entitled benefits will be revoked; his delegate status for the 20th National Congress of the CPC is terminated; all gains from his violations and crimes will be confiscated; and the suspected criminal cases have been transferred to the procuratorial organ for legal review and prosecution, along with related assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Xiaopeng, former Party Secretary and Chairman of China CITIC Group, has been removed from his party membership and public office due to serious violations of discipline and law. (CCTV News)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Zhi, former Party Secretary and Chairman of Guizhou Bank, is currently under disciplinary review and investigation by the Guizhou Provincial Supervisory Commission due to suspected serious violations of discipline and law&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;huijin-increases-its-stake-in-the-four-largest-banks-after-eight-years&#34;&gt;Huijin increases its stake in the four largest banks after eight years
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 11th, China&amp;rsquo;s four largest state-owned commercial banks – Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and Construction Bank – announced that Huijin Capital increased their holdings by 27.61 million shares, 37.27 million shares, 24.89 million shares, and 18.38 million shares respectively; Huijin Capital plans to continue increasing its stake in the four banks on the secondary market within the next six months&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Chinas COVID-19 lifting of restrictions</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The policy was announced suddenly and implemented swiftly; travel codes are now defunct, and green health codes are no longer checked at public venues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browsing the New York Times Chinese website, the entire page is discussing China&amp;rsquo;s reopening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record the surroundings, without evaluating policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing never actually had zero-COVID policies. With restrictions lifted, the virus spread rapidly, resulting in widespread infections, but none of my friends have experienced severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shenzhen, neighboring Guangzhou, is also developing rapidly; while living in Shanghai, due to my company&amp;rsquo;s location near the suburbs, there hasn’t been widespread infection yet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insufficient protective measures, followed by widespread spread&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt roughly the same, with sudden shifts – a new policy every week until full reopening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s undeniable that the three-year zero-COVID policy had an effect; adapting to whatever comes&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Without understanding politics or offering commentary, documenting this &amp;ldquo;carnival&amp;rdquo; on the internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;random-thoughts&#34;&gt;Random thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent &lt;strong&gt;唐山打人事件&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;人教小学教材文化入侵事件&lt;/strong&gt;, I wonder how many still remember. These hot topics in the news have become numbing; there&amp;rsquo;s little feeling, just watching shows as usual after work, a mere spectacle. The economic situation is already like this—an outbreak of war won’t make things better. No political commentary, just recording this &amp;ldquo;celebration&amp;rdquo; online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;please-provide-the-chinese-text-you-want-me-to-translate-i-am-ready-when-you-are-just-paste-the-text-here&#34;&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are! Just paste the text here.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, often referred to as Pelosi&amp;rsquo;s trip to Taiwan, was part of a larger tour of Asian countries undertaken by the then-Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese side strongly protested, dispatching naval destroyer formations to the northeast waters of the Taiwan Strait and mobilizing two carrier strike groups – Shandong and Liaoning – while the Eastern Theater Command and Southern Theater Command conducted large-scale live-fire exercises in the East China Sea and South China Sea respectively. The U.S. responded by deploying the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group to the waters near Taiwan to protect a potential visit by Pelosi, and has also deployed multiple reconnaissance aircraft and aerial refueling tankers to Marine Corps Air Station Kadena in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden held a video conference prior to the visit, discussing the Taiwan issue. Reports indicate that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a congressional delegation are expected to arrive at Taipei Songshan Airport on August 2nd, spend the night, and meet with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and other high-ranking government officials on August 3rd. Some observers believe Pelosi’s visit could trigger a new Taiwan Strait crisis, the first since the 1996 missile crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;08-11&#34;&gt;08-11
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s essentially settled now. Headlines have been dominated by naval exercises, and Zhihu has been working hard to update its trending topics daily—all about this subject. The editor appreciates the effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Shanghai Hot Pot Lockdown</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-closure/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 23:03:27 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The leadership insisted Shanghai wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be locked down, citing its importance. But facing the current situation—or to protect their own reputations—they took a piecemeal approach: first sealing off the area across from Huangpu River, then sealing this side as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lockdown&#34;&gt;Lockdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have vague memories of SARS from childhood; it ended relatively quickly due to its short incubation period, before a nationwide outbreak occurred. I remember being in elementary school then, dismissed early each day, and the classroom always smelled of disinfectant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the end of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing for nearly three years. People working outside their hometowns have become accustomed to wearing masks when necessary. This wave of the outbreak in Shanghai initially originated from Hong Kong, spreading through cross-border checkpoints to Shenzhen. The situation in Shanghai was also caused by imported cases from Hong Kong. Authorities later announced that the spread was due to inadequate protective measures at quarantine hotels, allowing a variant with weakened toxicity but faster transmission—spread via the hotel&amp;rsquo;s ventilation system—to proliferate. Initially, it wasn’t severe and could have been contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are always confident. The leaders in Shanghai are the same. They chose a risk control system we can implement with grid-based management and precise monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are clear – the new cases have exceeded 20,000. Faced with this situation, a lockdown was implemented, but it&amp;rsquo;s being referred to using different terminology to avoid using the word &amp;ldquo;lockdown,&amp;rdquo; as that contradicts earlier statements claiming Shanghai did not need one, preserving face for the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grocery-shopping&#34;&gt;Grocery shopping
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food delivery industry is a new sector spurred by the internet. Its core requirement is someone to deliver your order, but due to widespread lockdowns, businesses could operate, yet lacked delivery personnel – essentially missing a crucial link in the process. Outsiders might find it puzzling that people in a global city like Shanghai would rush to buy groceries en masse. However, it&amp;rsquo;s quite understandable; most residents are migrant workers living in rented apartments and typically rely on company canteens or restaurants instead of cooking at home. When these options were unavailable, those who could afford it started buying groceries. Because the lockdown announcement was unexpected, people lacked substantial food and vegetable reserves. This led to the rush seen in videos, which in turn caused gatherings that directly contributed to renewed spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;industry&#34;&gt;Industry
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone I know works in the IT industry. The pandemic gave me a taste of working from home – back in 2019, I was stuck at home for almost a month, rescheduling train tickets countless times, unable to determine when I could return to Shenzhen. It&amp;rsquo;s unimaginable what people in the food, tourism, and service industries have been through these past few years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Decline of Capital Monopoly and the Online Education Industry</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:59:08 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The stock market has fallen sharply over the past two trading days, giving new investors a taste of market risk. Our country is about to enter an aging phase, and birth rate data is grim—the decline significantly exceeded expert estimates. Industries hindering birth rates will be cracked down on by the Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-student-workload&#34;&gt;Reducing student workload
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We, born in the 90s, didn&amp;rsquo;t have so many extracurricular classes or tutoring sessions. After school, we’d just run wild and play – partly due to family circumstances and partly because tutoring hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet established a brand reputation to convince parents. Twenty years have passed. Starting in 2019, K12 education began its capitalization trend, with companies like Yuanfudao emerging as leading online tutoring platforms. Fueled by capital, they concentrated resources to create various prestigious tutoring programs, and even exorbitant fees couldn&amp;rsquo;t contain parental enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst urbanization, many parents have escaped poverty and achieved upward mobility through education. As working professionals with limited time, they are highly driven themselves and want their children to keep up with their peers. With few alternative paths for families without strong educational backgrounds to maintain or advance their social standing, pursuing vocational high school is often seen as a step down – something most parents cannot accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do extracurricular tutoring exist, and why do parents need it? Textbook knowledge and example problems are easily understood, but many subjects cover a broad range of topics, albeit superficially. Talent selection requires differentiation, creating a contradiction: textbook-based questions alone cannot effectively filter candidates and require horizontal and vertical expansion. These areas are impossible for teachers to fully cover in class, and this gap fosters the growth of extracurricular tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document contains extensive content, with thirty detailed provisions regulating various aspects. Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the guiding document outline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce overall homework volume and duration, easing students&amp;rsquo; excessive workload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve school after-school services to meet diverse student needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strictly regulate after-school tutoring activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significantly improve education and teaching quality, ensuring students learn well while at school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen supporting measures and enhance capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully organized and implemented, aiming for practical results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;elite-education&#34;&gt;Elite education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the education sector, a growing trend is the increasing number of private schools, while public schools are struggling to provide sufficient quality resources (leading to the rise of desirable school districts). Various educational groups attract talented teachers with high salaries and establish excellent learning environments, gradually building their brands. A well-known example is &lt;strong&gt;衡水模式&lt;/strong&gt;. The average annual cost at a reputable private elementary school can range from nine thousand to ten thousand dollars. These education groups create a positive cycle: higher tuition fees are justified by skilled teachers, good student results, and continued parental enrollment. Consequently, talented public school teachers are drawn to the private sector, ultimately leading to a decline in the quality of public education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;algorithm-exploitation&#34;&gt;Algorithm exploitation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data indicates that Meituan has nearly four million signed riders, with 400,000 to 500,000 active. Many depend on this work to support their families. Relentless algorithmic pressure squeezes delivery time, reducing people to measurable units and feeding them into calculations, constantly pushing riders to the point of collapse. It seems clever, but it is. The market is here; let&amp;rsquo;s play a good game—a sustainable one—rather than a destructive one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility&#34;&gt;Stock market volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 2021, education stocks, led by New Oriental, performed a dazzling dive, followed shortly thereafter by U.S.-listed companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our country is gradually entering an aging population phase. Various social phenomena affecting family planning will be addressed; internet companies with monopolistic practices and excessive overtime have been fined, and the education industry where capital has concentrated has also been regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education should not be capitalized; any attempt at listing for financing is immediately rejected, leading to widespread outcry&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a tangent: the differences between socialism with Chinese characteristics and capitalism. Older generations often say, &amp;ldquo;To get rich, first build roads.&amp;rdquo; Infrastructure construction in China is funded by the state; in a capitalist society, these projects would be contracted out. In remote areas where there’s no profit to be made, companies wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be willing to take on such work. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to stray too far from the article&amp;rsquo;s main topic, but ordinary people may not feel much impact from the trade war. However, China&amp;rsquo;s high-end manufacturing has consistently been relatively weak. In my IT industry, memory, hard drives, CPUs, and graphics cards – the core components of a computer – all come from foreign factories. These parts account for 50% of the total cost of a machine. The development of high-end manufacturing is essential. A collision between China and the United States is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sino-American trade war (also known as the China–United States trade war, or Sino-American trade dispute/friction/dispute) was a trade war between the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China and the United States&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade dispute originated when U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on March 22, 2018, claiming &amp;ldquo;China steals American intellectual property and business secrets&amp;rdquo; and directing the United States Trade Representative to impose tariffs on goods imported from China under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, involving an estimated total value of $60 billion. On July 6, 2018, the U.S. imposed a 25% tariff on Chinese goods exported to the U.S., valued at $340 billion. The Ministry of Commerce of China responded with retaliatory measures, imposing a 25% tariff on U.S. goods exported to China, valued at $340 billion, including soybeans, a major U.S. export.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China previously reached a consensus in May 2018 to suspend the trade war, issuing a joint statement seeking resolution. However, the USTR subsequently announced the first batch of tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese goods on June 16, raising the original 10% rate to 25%. In response, China’s State Council Tariff Commission implemented retaliatory measures, and the Ministry of Commerce restarted anti-dumping investigations on multiple US products. On July 6, the Trump administration formally imposed a 25% tariff on $340 billion worth of Chinese goods (with an additional $160 billion subject to tariffs on August 23), marking the formal implementation of Trump’s China tariffs. The Ministry of Commerce stated that the US had violated WTO rules and launched the largest trade war in economic history. Customs authorities confirmed that China&amp;rsquo;s retaliatory measures were implemented after the US tariffs took effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 1st at the G20 Buenos Aires summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump reached a consensus to initiate 90-day negotiations and suspend new trade measures during that period. After the March 1, 2019 deadline expired, the U.S. announced significant progress and extended the suspension of new trade measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs of 25% on Chinese goods entering the United States valued at approximately $200 billion, bringing the total subject to tariffs to $250 billion. The measure took effect on June 1 for goods arriving at U.S. ports. On May 13, China’s State Council Tariff Commission announced that it would raise tariffs by 5% to 25% on certain imports from the United States valued at $60 billion, effective June 1. On June 1, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative delayed the imposition of its 25% tariffs until June 15, while China’s State Council Tariff Commission stated that its tariff measures would take effect as scheduled on June 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 29, leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump met at the G20 Osaka Summit, agreeing to restart trade negotiations and for the US not to impose new tariffs on Chinese products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 1st, due to the Trump administration&amp;rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the progress of China’s purchases of U.S. agricultural products, Trump announced via Twitter that a 10% tariff would be imposed on all remaining Chinese goods imported into the United States starting September 1, 2019, amounting to $300 billion. On August 5th, the yuan-dollar exchange rate fell below 7. The same day, the U.S. Treasury Department declared China a currency manipulator. Subsequently, the Chinese government announced a suspension of purchases of U.S. agricultural products and on August 24th announced tariffs of 10% or 5% on approximately $75 billion worth of U.S. goods, as well as restoring tariffs on U.S. automobiles and their parts; the United States responded by increasing the tariff rate on the previously levied $300 billion in Chinese goods to 15%, and raising the existing 25% tariff on $250 billion in Chinese goods to 30%, but this was later suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 16, 2020, China and the United States signed the Phase One trade agreement&lt;/p&gt;</description>
