        <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, investors focused on financial news. Since Trump’s return, they also needed to pay attention to his Twitter (a private version). The trade war continued to escalate, leading to a sharp decline on April 7th, which was quickly followed by a rebound. This time, though, are people still willing to jump in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-review&#34;&gt;Background Review
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 7, 2025, impacted by the U.S. implementation of “reciprocal tariffs,” global stock markets experienced a “Black Monday.” The A-share market plummeted, with the Shanghai Composite Index falling 7.34% and the Shenzhen Component Exchange Index down 12.5%, with over 4,300 stocks declining by more than 9%. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong fell by 13.22%, and European and U.S. stock indices also fell by more than 4%. China subsequently stabilized the market through state-owned enterprise (SOE) purchases and intervention by Huishang Securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 10th, U.S. stocks suffered another sharp decline, with Chinese HShares falling 6%, driven primarily by expectations of escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. Trump signaled a further increase in tariffs on China, and the U.S. would also impose hefty fees on Chinese ships. China announced retaliatory measures and charged special port fees, compounded by a government shutdown, declining consumer confidence, and market panic selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115351840469973590&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;position-control&#34;&gt;Position Control
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the state of short selling in the A-share market is not a complete zero-short scenario; there’s a small portion of index funds within Fixed Income Plus. The majority of investments are still concentrated in the Hong Kong stock market. Xiaomi has already incurred principal losses, and Meituan remains a shareholder. Position control is somewhat out of sync. Should we jump in and gamble on Monday? It&amp;rsquo;s a question to consider. We currently don’t have sufficient cash flow; if we need to enter, we would rely on old friends like Alipay’s Jiebei (borrowing function) to secure bridging funds. &lt;strong&gt;Greedy snakes swallow elephants&lt;/strong&gt; – the position control is extremely unreasonable. We should look for opportunities to reduce our holdings in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;associated-term-definitions&#34;&gt;Associated Term Definitions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;black-swan&#34;&gt;Black Swan
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “Black Swan” originates from Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s book &lt;em&gt;The Black Swan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concept:&lt;/strong&gt; Refers to events that are &lt;strong&gt;extremely unlikely&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;unpredictable&lt;/strong&gt;, but upon occurring, they generate &lt;strong&gt;extreme impact and disruptive consequences&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rarity/Unpredictability:&lt;/strong&gt; These events have no precedent or warning signs before they occur, exceeding all conventional expectations and model predictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extreme Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Once they happen, they can cause catastrophic effects on markets, economies, and even societies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post Hoc Rationalization:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite being impossible to predict beforehand, people tend to find reasons and explanations after the event occurs, making it seem “understandable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source Legend:&lt;/strong&gt; Before the discovery of Australia, Europeans believed all swans were white until black swans were discovered in Australia, completely overturning thousands of years of knowledge. Therefore, the Black Swan symbolizes &lt;strong&gt;unforeseen and cognitive breakthroughs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Market Examples:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;9/11&amp;rdquo; terrorist attacks in 2001 (a short-term shock to global markets).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The initial impact of the &lt;strong&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/strong&gt; on the global economy and markets (although some argued it had gray rhino characteristics, its sudden outbreak and global spread, as well as the extent of its impact, were largely considered Black Swans).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gray-rhino&#34;&gt;Gray Rhino
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “Gray Rhino” was coined by Michele Wucker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concept:&lt;/strong&gt; Refers to a potential crisis that is &lt;strong&gt;highly probable&lt;/strong&gt;, has a &lt;strong&gt;significant impact&lt;/strong&gt;, and yet is &lt;strong&gt;ignored&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;selectively delayed in addressing&lt;/strong&gt; due to its &lt;strong&gt;obvious warning signs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Probability/Predictability:&lt;/strong&gt; The event has clear indicators and evidence before it occurs, making it a &lt;strong&gt;known&lt;/strong&gt; risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easily Ignored:&lt;/strong&gt; Because it’s not sudden but rather long-term or slowly developing, people become numb, exhibit optimism bias, or procrastinate, failing to take timely action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Once it erupts, due to the lack of effective responses beforehand, it triggers a chain reaction and causes severe destructive consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source Allusion:&lt;/strong&gt; A gray rhino is large in size and has a slow reaction time; people can see it from afar, but often fail to avoid it because of negligence or indifference. Once it charges towards you, it will cause a fatal collision. Therefore, the gray rhino symbolizes &lt;strong&gt;obvious yet ignored&lt;/strong&gt; major threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Market Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2008 &lt;strong&gt;Global Financial Crisis&lt;/strong&gt; (many experts had already warned about the high risk of the US subprime mortgage market, but were largely ignored).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sovereign Debt Crises&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;severe asset bubbles&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;systemic risks from climate change&lt;/strong&gt; (these are long-accumulated, traceable large risks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Productivity and Marketing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/productivity-and-marketing/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2025 19:15:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/productivity-and-marketing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“As I recall, Xiaomi was able to break through initially thanks to its solid product quality and distinctive cost-performance advantage – in those early years, other brands would often price similar models at four or five thousand yuan, while Xiaomi could keep the price under two thousand yuan. Many people were switching phones at that time, and they chose Xiaomi because of the ‘low-cost entry into high configuration.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-situation&#34;&gt;Current Situation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the past two or three generations of flagship phones, the upgrade momentum has noticeably weakened. Every time I look at new product parameters and features, it’s hard to have a “wow” moment – most are minor adjustments: such as camera algorithm optimization, slight battery life improvements, or simply changing the color scheme. There&amp;rsquo;s a lack of core changes that leave a lasting impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading the full text of Xiaomi 17’s launch event, this feeling is even more pronounced — this generation’s upgrades are still limited, whether it’s performance or features, they haven’t stepped out of the “minor repairs” category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actually, this isn&amp;rsquo;t just about Xiaomi; the entire digital technology industry now faces a similar situation: significant breakthroughs in hardware are becoming increasingly difficult to achieve, and the industry as a whole seems to be entering a slowdown. Unlike several years ago, when there were dazzling new developments every year – screen refresh rates increased, charging speeds doubled – it’s now much more difficult to achieve disruptive breakthroughs in hardware.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With many rational users dominating discussions on Zhihu (a Chinese Q&amp;amp;A platform), the related topics for Xiaomi 17&amp;rsquo;s launch are overwhelmingly critical, highlighting the small upgrade intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;marketing-prowess&#34;&gt;Marketing Prowess
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The runaway success of the Xiaomi SU7 unexpectedly reached a large number of previously overlooked female users, allowing Xiaomi to discover new user growth segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost simultaneously, the “Xiaomi 16 directly renamed to Xiaomi 17” event perfectly capitalized on this attention – not only did this break external stereotypes about Xiaomi phones, but it also leveraged “porting” to generate buzz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goodwill accumulated by the SU7’s users resonated with the public sentiment surrounding the rebranding: those interested in the SU7 would be curious about Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s phone products, and those who noticed the renaming would also be more inclined to learn about Xiaomi’s reputation thanks to the SU7’s positive word-of-mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this synergy allowed the Xiaomi 17 launch event to successfully break through to a significant number of non-traditional users who were previously unfamiliar with Xiaomi.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Zhejiang financial circle collapsed, and the anti-corruption efforts over the past two years have not been limited to government departments.</title>

        <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 20:57:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/the-zhejiang-financial-circle-collapsed-and-the-anti-corruption-efforts-over-the-past-two-years-have-not-been-limited-to-government-departments/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw a report on Douyin about an anti-corruption investigation in the Zhejiang financial sector. I had written about the prelude to financial corruption once before, but didn&amp;rsquo;t follow up on related reports afterward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still check financial news every day, and previously I rarely saw any reports about financial corruption. However, there have been increasing reports of financial corruption over the past two years, with more and more senior executives from banks, securities firms, and other financial institutions being investigated.
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain-rise/&#34; &gt;Financial Anti-Corruption Curtain Rise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent systemic anti-corruption storm in the Zhejiang financial sector is one of the most iconic events in China’s financial field in recent years. This anti-corruption campaign, which began in 2023, centered around the collective downfall of the former presidents of Zhejiang branches of four major state-owned banks, exposing long-standing issues of power abuse and collusion between government and businesses within local financial systems. The following outlines the event timeline, core problems, underlying causes, and subsequent impacts from four dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-event-timeline-from-the-zhu-xiaoyu-case-to-the-collapse-of-the-gang-leaders-of-the-four-major-banks&#34;&gt;I. Event Timeline: From the Zhu Xiaoyu Case to the Collapse of the “Gang Leaders” of the Four Major Banks
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Spark: The Zhu Xiaoyu Case Unearths a Rotten Financial System Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In May 2023, Zhejiang Provincial Vice Governor Zhu Xiaoyu was investigated, and his corrupt pattern of &amp;ldquo;eating off finance&amp;rdquo; became a breakthrough point. During his tenure, he obtained massive profits through interfering in corporate IPOs and loans, and formed an alliance of interests with financial institution executives. In November 2023, Zhu Xiaoyu was expelled from the Communist Party and public office, and the numerous clues provided during the investigation directly triggered subsequent seismic events within the financial system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Corruption Storm Intensifies: Original Heads of Zhejiang Branches of the Four Major Banks Fall&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; Guo XinGang, the former Chairman of the China Bank’s Zhejiang Branch, was investigated. After retiring, he made money through low-priced property purchases and equity premiums, abusing his authority in mineral loan approvals, resulting in significant losses of state assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; Gao Qiang, the former Chairman of the Construction Bank’s Zhejiang Branch, was investigated. During his tenure, he illegally approved loans leading to multiple projects going bankrupt and receiving “consulting fees” exceeding tens of millions of yuan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; Feng Jianlong, the former Chairman of the Agricultural Bank’s Zhejiang Branch, voluntarily confessed, and during his tenure, he transformed the Zhejiang branch of the Agricultural Bank into a &amp;ldquo;family industrial business,&amp;rdquo; with relatives holding illegal positions and serious misconduct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 30, 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; Shen Rongqin, the former Chairman of ICBC’s Zhejiang Branch, was investigated. After retiring, he controlled institutions such as Changtang River Jinran Academy through “political rotation,” forming a network of interests with eight private enterprises.  Within 15 months, all the original heads of the four major banks&amp;rsquo; Zhejiang branches fell, creating a closed-loop anti-corruption effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory System Also Shakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In January 2025, Pan Guang’en, former Deputy Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee’s Financial Bureau, voluntarily confessed, using his privileged position to facilitate corporate equity reforms and investments, illegally receiving massive amounts of money. This marked a shift in the anti-corruption campaign from financial institutions to regulatory departments, revealing the deep entanglement of the “regulatory-financial institution-private enterprise” three-party interest chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-core-issues-credit-corruption-and-rotating-door-interest-chains&#34;&gt;II. Core Issues: Credit Corruption and Rotating Door Interest Chains
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misappropriation of Lending Power: The Core Tool of Corruption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All four former heads of the major banks utilized their lending power to transfer interests: Guo XinGang violated regulations by issuing mineral loans, Gao Qiang manipulated credit through “consulting fees,” Feng Jianlong’s family-style lending led to bad debts, and Shen Rongqin used the Golden Research Institute platform to channel funds to related enterprises. Data shows that 68% of individuals investigated within the banking system in 2024 were involved in illegal lending or loan approvals, highlighting a deeply concerning loss of control over lending power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotational Corruption: Retirement is Not a Safe Deposit Box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All four individuals continued to wield power through “identity transformation” after retirement: Guo XinGang served as the president of an industry association to intervene in credit lending, Gao Qiang transitioned to a securities dealer director to manipulate capital, and Shen Rongqin established a “financial-academic-research” platform to connect with private enterprises. This “retire and continue” model allowed retired executives to evade regulation and form hidden interest chains. The 2024 Financial Anti-Corruption White Paper revealed that 68% of cases involved retired executives, with the Zhejiang case serving as a typical example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurred Boundaries Between Government and Business: Interest Transfer from Banks to Private Enterprises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Changtang River Golden Research Institute, led by Shen Rongqin, was established with investments from eight private enterprises including Zhentai and Chuanhua, ostensibly an academic institution but in reality a political-economic nexus. Through this platform, Shen Rongqin directed banking resources towards related enterprises, forming a “banking institution – private enterprise think tank” binding model. Similar models were also evident in the cases of Guo XinGang and Gao Qiang, exposing the deep distortion of political-economic relations within local financial ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;three-root-causes-institutional-loopholes-and-regulatory-failures&#34;&gt;Three. Root Causes: Institutional Loopholes and Regulatory Failures
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Absence of Local Financial Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a major province for private economy, Zhejiang has been active in financial innovation, but the regulatory system hasn’t kept pace. Officials such as Zhu from Ju and Pan Guang&amp;rsquo;en have long dominated local financial policies, acting as both “athletes” and “referees,” leading to ineffective regulation. For example, during his tenure at the Financial Bureau, Pan Guang&amp;rsquo;en illegally interfered in corporate financing and share reform, but was not effectively restrained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure of Internal Controls within Financial Institutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internal supervision mechanisms of the four major banks’ Zhejiang branches were essentially empty. When Feng Jianlong served as the chairman of Zhejiang Branch of Agricultural Bank, his relatives quickly rose through the system, and the “one-voice” credit approval phenomenon was prominent. Shen Rongqin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Employee Care Plan&amp;rdquo; ostensibly provided welfare, but actually consolidated power by controlling frontline employees to cover up corrupt behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak External Supervision Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enabling of cross-provincial investigations (such as the Shen Rongqin case being handled by the Liaoning Provincial Supervisory Commission) demonstrated that local protectionism had severely hindered anti-corruption progress. Furthermore, the complex equity relationships between financial institutions and private enterprises (such as half of the top ten loan customers of Zhejiang Merchants Bank were real estate companies) made risk transmission hidden, making traditional regulatory measures difficult to penetrate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;four-subsequent-impacts-regulatory-upgrading-and-industry-restructuring&#34;&gt;Four. Subsequent Impacts: Regulatory Upgrading and Industry Restructuring
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normalization of Anti-Corruption and Systemic Plugging of Leaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Provincial Supervision and Penetrating Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;: The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection adopted remote case handling to cut through local protection networks, and extended the scope of scrutiny from on-duty behavior to interest chains after retirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological Anti-Corruption Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;: Zhejiang piloted AI risk control models for credit approval, automatically identifying “people-based loans” and “political-business loans,” effectively curbing corruption at its source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restrictions on Departing Executives&lt;/strong&gt;: Zhejiang Province is drafting the &amp;ldquo;List of Financial Executive Post-Employment Restrictions,&amp;rdquo; stipulating that bank chairpersons are prohibited from serving affiliated companies within three years after retirement, cutting off chains of power options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restructuring of the Financial Ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systemic Risk Clearance in Banks&lt;/strong&gt;: Institutions such as Zhejiang Business Bank and Hangzhou Bank were initiated internal restructuring due to the downfall of senior executives, and high real estate loan ratios (such as Zhejiang Business Bank’s real estate non-performing asset rate reaching 2.48%) forced business transformation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimization of Financing Environment for Private Enterprises&lt;/strong&gt;: Following anti-corruption actions, Zhejiang Province launched policies such as “Zheke Loan,” providing 450 billion yuan in loans to 32,000 technology SMEs in 2024, driving finance back to its original purpose of serving the real economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Warning Effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The collective downfall of former branch managers of the four major banks in Zhejiang shattered the illusion of “safety after retirement,” conveying a signal of “zero tolerance and no blind spots” in financial anti-corruption. This event also provides a mirror for the entire Chinese financial system: only by strengthening power constraints and improving regulatory systems can we safeguard financial security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the Zhejiang financial circle was fundamentally a concentrated outburst of long-term loss of control over local financial power. This storm not only cleared out a number of “financial pests,” but also drove profound changes in regulatory models, institutional design, and industry ecosystems. In the future, how to balance financial innovation with risk management, and how to build “clean” government-business relationships will continue to be subjects of ongoing exploration for Zhejiang and even the entire Chinese financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Long time no see bull market in stocks</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/long-time-no-see-bull-market-in-stocks/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:42:26 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the eve of the 2024 National Day holiday, China’s stock market experienced a remarkable surge, attracting considerable attention. However, following the holiday, the market unexpectedly turned to a dramatic plunge. This “polarization” of the stock market – a rollercoaster ride between soaring highs and plummeting lows – not only subjected investors to a thrilling yet nerve-wracking experience, but also prompted deep reflection within the market regarding policy, economic conditions, and fundamental market rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-national-day-stock-market-surge-a-policy-driven-frenzy&#34;&gt;Pre-National Day Stock Market Surge: A Policy-Driven Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the five trading days leading up to National Day, China’s stock market surged from a slump into “boiling mode.” On September 30th, the A-share market saw a full-scale rally with all indices hitting historic highs. The Shanghai Composite Index rose by 8.06%, the Shenzhen Component Index increased by 10.67%, and the Innovation Board China Advanced Index soared by 15.36%, while the STAR 50 Index achieved its largest single-day rise in history, jumping 22.84%. Market sentiment was extremely exuberant, with daily trading volumes across the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Northern Exchanges reaching RMB 2611.5 billion, a significant increase of RMB 11559 billion compared to the previous trading day. More than 5300 stocks on the main board rallied collectively, creating a “sea of red.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core driver behind this rally was the concentrated release of a series of unexpectedly positive policies by the government and the resulting changes in market expectations. On September 24th, the People’s Bank of China announced a cut in the reserve requirement ratio and interest rates, reducing existing mortgage loan interest rates and standardizing the minimum down payment ratios. The Politburo Standing Committee’s meeting on September 26th emphasized the need to intensify counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policy adjustments to boost capital markets and actively guide medium and long-term funds into the market. On September 30th, a series of real estate support policies were released. These measures conveyed the government&amp;rsquo;s determination to stabilize the market and promote growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-national-day-stock-market-plunge-calm-and-adjustment-after-the-frenzy&#34;&gt;Post-National Day Stock Market Plunge: Calm and Adjustment After the Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, market sentiment plummeted sharply after the National Day holiday. On October 8th, the A-share market opened strongly with nearly a limit-up rise, but following a significant high opening, the market experienced violent fluctuations before closing down. Since then, the market’s center of gravity has continuously shifted downwards, and as of October 16th, the Shanghai Composite Index rose and fell by more than 15%, cumulatively falling by over 470 points. From October 8th to 10th, core A-share indices all declined, with the Shenzhen Component Index down 6.21%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this plunge are multifaceted. On one hand, it was a digestion of risks accumulated from the rapid rise in the previous period; on the other hand, it was also related to adjustments in market expectations regarding policy. Some investors believed that the short-term effects of policies were already evident, but the long-term effects still needed to be observed. Furthermore, volatility in global markets also impacted A-shares. On October 9th, the Hang Seng Index fell by 9.41%, and A50 futures fell by 10.4%, further exacerbating market declines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflection-and-outlook-on-the-market&#34;&gt;Reflection and Outlook on the Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dramatic volatility in the stock market around National Day highlighted a deep reflection among investors regarding policy, economics, and market fundamentals. On one hand, the short-term stimulus effects of policies were significant, but their long-term impact remains to be observed. On the other hand, the rapid rise and fall of the market served as a reminder for investors to maintain rationality and avoid emotional investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, whether A-shares can usher in a genuine “long bull” trend depends on whether policy can effectively transmit to the real economy and ultimately drive substantive improvements in economic fundamentals. Investors should closely monitor the specific implementation of policies and changes in economic data to rationally adjust their investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp rises and falls in the stock market around National Day were a game between policy and the market, and also a test of investors’ mentality. In this “two-pronged” market environment, we saw the power of the market and the influence of policy. How the market will unfold in the future remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;III. Financial institutions in the banking industry shall reasonably determine the specific interest rate level for each loan, taking into account the interest rate limits determined by provincial market interest rate pricing self-regulatory mechanisms (if any) and factors such as the operating conditions of the institution and its customer risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-personal-housing-mortgage-loan-interest-rates-by-025-percentage-points&#34;&gt;Reducing Personal Housing Mortgage Loan Interest Rates by 0.25 Percentage Points

The interest rates for first-time and second-home personal housing mortgage loans with a term of less than 5 years (including 5 years) will be adjusted to 2.35% and 2.85%, respectively.  The interest rates for first-time and second-home personal housing mortgage loans with a term of less than 5 years (including 5 years) will also be no lower than 2.775% and 3.325%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to implement the decision-making deployment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, adapt to the new supply and demand relationship in China’s real estate market and the new expectations of people for high-quality housing, and promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, the following matters regarding personal mortgage loans are hereby notified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For residential households purchasing commercial first-time home purchases, the minimum down payment ratio for commercial personal mortgages on first-time home purchases will be adjusted to no less than 15%, and the minimum down payment ratio for commercial personal mortgages on second-time home purchases will be adjusted to no less than 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, the branches of the People’s Bank of China at each provincial level, and the派出机构 (outposts) of the National Financial Supervision and Administration will, according to the control requirements of local governments, independently determine the minimum down payment ratio limits for first-time and second-time home purchases in various cities based on a principle of tailoring policies to local conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-central-bank-will-establish-a-30-billion-yuan-guarantee-housing-re-loan&#34;&gt;The Central Bank Will Establish a 30 Billion Yuan Guarantee Housing Re-Loan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 4:00 PM, representatives from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the People’s Bank of China, and the National Financial Supervision and Administration Commission gathered at a routine policy briefing by the State Council to introduce measures to effectively ensure contract fulfillment (保交房).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Vice Governor Tao Ling announced that the central bank will establish a 30 billion yuan guarantee housing re-loan facility to support local state-owned enterprises in purchasing completed but unsold commercial properties at reasonable prices for use as self-built or rental-based affordable housing. This is expected to drive an additional 50 billion yuan in bank loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the People’s Bank of China, the guarantee housing re-loan term can be extended up to four times annually, with a rate of 1.75%, aimed at 21 nationwide banks. It incentivizes banks to lend to local state-owned enterprises selected by city governments to purchase completed but unsold commercial properties for use as affordable housing. The purchased properties are strictly limited to those commercially available properties built by real estate developers that have not yet been sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding this policy, the central bank will soon issue the &lt;em&gt;Notice on Measures Concerning the Establishment of the Guarantee Housing Re-Loan Facility&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starch noodles and roadside stalls: The new influence of capital’s news.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/sausages-and-street-vendors-capital-news-influence/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;315 actually did not report on “chicken mud,” and this issue itself has been confusing the official exposure of CCTV’s 3·15 Gala with other food safety hotspots that occurred concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zhihu-answer-journalismhttpswwwzhihucomquestion648967411answer3433834122&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zhihu.com/question/648967411/answer/3433834122&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zhihu Answer: Journalism&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 315 evening event mentioned nine manufacturers, and none of them included potato starch (daoniansan). Now, the major brands that were nominated have lost all heat, while this potato starch – which is a national staple (found on almost every street food corner across China with a large number of stalls, likely the most prevalent) – has been brought out to argue and it feels like potato starch is being entirely scapegoated. I’ve looked at online news sources; CCTV released a report on ham on 3.15, listing only a few manufacturers&amp;rsquo; ingredients, and none of those manufacturers were primarily producers of potato starch. There was nothing obviously wrong with their ingredients, and then this reporter used information from an employee at one factory who said they sometimes use chicken bone meal to substitute for meat – something that was rumored – and she went to inquire on Taobao about pet food suppliers selling chicken bone meal: “Can people eat it?” This isn’t a stupid question, is it? They dare to sell it to pets? Then rumors spread that potato starch contained chicken bone meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, many factories are likely to close down, and tens of thousands of small street vendors across the country face the situation of having goods unsold and no business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-life-on-earth&#34;&gt;Real Life on Earth
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Xiaoxiang Morning News reports on March 17th, the day after the “stuck starch tube collapse” incident in Sanmenxia, Henan, an elderly woman set up a stall selling starch tubes two days later, but after two hours, she still didn’t attract any customers and ultimately quietly ate the starch tubes herself. The photographer said that he himself usually eats four or five starch tubes at once, but after learning that the starch tubes contained chicken bone mud, he refused to eat them. That day, out of curiosity about whether anyone would still buy her sausages after they were exposed, he saw that the vendor hadn’t sold a single tube in two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aunt didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about the starch tube incident; she only knew that suddenly no one was buying her grilled sausages today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elderly woman was right; she was just trying to make a living, and the elderly woman didn’t even know if the product had any problems or whether it was qualified, nor did she know what bone mud was. She didn&amp;rsquo;t know about the internet; she was simply a bottom-level person finding ways to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starch tubes collapsed, but the bill was paid by one after another of bottom-level vendors. It’s a painful process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zhihu-answer-regulatory-issueshttpswwwzhihucomquestion648967411answer3433978475&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zhihu.com/question/648967411/answer/3433978475&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zhihu Answer: Regulatory Issues&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, during an afternoon, my colleague who was working in Beijing and I went to have lunch. We passed by a small stall selling sausages and sizzling beef skewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blurted out, “With all this black technology starch sausage and sizzling beef, are people even going to eat it?” Because in my view, the last time I ate a starch-based ham sausage was probably about fifteen years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague hesitated and then said tactfully, &amp;ldquo;Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve been living in a big city. Actually, in our hometown, pickled cabbage, instant noodles, and ham sausages are everyday staples.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I was in school, my dad would only let me have a sausage on the road if I got full marks. It wasn’t because they were unhygienic; sausages simply cost 1.5 yuan, enough to buy two pounds of vegetables.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way we call instant noodles, carbonated drinks, and spicy strips ‘junk food’ – I only learned about that after coming to Beijing for school.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized how arrogant my casual words had been and stopped talking. But this incident left a deep impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this is the daily life of most Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lives don&amp;rsquo;t include fancy “Mediterranean diets,” “green organic vegetables,” or “non-GMO soybeans.” They only care about whether they can buy some cheap and delicious vegetables, meat, and snacks, and enjoy the few moments of happiness their families have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re curious about what ingredients make up the things on shelves, whether they might harm their health, and if there are any strange chemical components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simply not something they should be concerned with or understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They simply believe that if there’s a problem, someone should be in charge, and it shouldn’t appear on the shelves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after watching a 315 episode, we realized that wasn’t the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-tech modifications were found in electronic scales and gasoline pumps, requiring YouTubers to take videos risking beatings to expose them, allowing regulators to “suddenly realize” and investigate;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pork belly and starch sausages sold on live streams and small stalls turned out to be made with rotten meat and bone meal, requiring CCTV reporters to go undercover and film before anyone verified the source and tracked it down;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Health wines” heavily promoted on television and airport advertisements needed someone to expose their entire backstory through videos before they were urgently removed overnight, disappearing from the public’s sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a year&amp;rsquo;s 315 event, every six or seven products are randomly pulled – is that enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you find those who have already eaten or bought them?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Oriental Zhentan Short Essay Incident: A Collision of Culture and Commerce</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/dongfang-zhenxuan-essay-controversy-culture-vs-commerce/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 18:57:25 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Zen Selection short essay incident was a online uproar triggered by Oriental Zen Selection’s official account denying that anchor Dong Yufei was the author of all the short essays. The truth is now unrecoverable, and the company&amp;rsquo;s power struggles have pushed this matter into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish’s seven-second memory will be handed over to &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; for writing, having experimented with &lt;code&gt;Bing AI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT Plus&lt;/code&gt;. The former provided more complete information, while the search engine still obtained more data, but the output blog content was not as complete and had a rigid format; the latter generated content based on keywords, which wasn’t as complete but could obtain full blog content. If given the URLs of reference materials, it could optimize the generated article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dongyu He incident, involving a short essay by Oriental Select, is a dispute centered around copyright and creative ownership. Beginning on December 5, 2023, it involved a series of interactions between anchor Dong Yuhe and Oriental Select. This storm not only revealed the complexities of commercial operations but also sparked profound reflections on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-5-2023-event-origin&#34;&gt;December 5, 2023: Event Origin
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongyu Hui, a host from Oriental Zhentan, quickly went viral after reciting “short essays” in a pre-release video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Zhentan stated in the video comments that most of these short essays were created by the copywriting team and not entirely from Dongyu Hui’s own hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-13-2023-dong-yufeis-response&#34;&gt;December 13, 2023: Dong Yufei’s Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Yufei published a lengthy article opposing the defamation of anyone under the guise of “fan circles,” stating her position on the matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-14-2023-management-response&#34;&gt;December 14, 2023: Management Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Xuhe (CEO of Oriental Zhensheng) released an apology video, admitting to management loopholes within the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yu Minhong (Chairman of Oriental Zhensheng) also responded to the incident, expressing apologies to Dong Yuhui.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-16-2023-major-decisions&#34;&gt;December 16, 2023: Major Decisions
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Zhentan officially removed Sun Dongxu from the CEO position, with Yu Minhong assuming the role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the same day, Yu Minhong published an apology letter, stating that he would unblock users who had been banned from live streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-18-2023-dong-yufeis-new-role&#34;&gt;December 18, 2023: Dong Yufei’s New Role
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Oriental Education &amp;amp; Technology Group appoints Dong Yufei as Chairman and Cultural Assistant of New Oriental Education &amp;amp; Technology Group, concurrently serving as Vice President of New Oriental Culture &amp;amp; Tourism Group.
-俞敏洪 (Yu Minhong) revealed that he will establish a studio with Dong Yufei to open new live broadcast accounts and live rooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-and-reflection&#34;&gt;Conclusion and Reflection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This storm was not only a dispute over copyright and creative ownership, but also deeply reflected the collision between culture and commerce. In today’s digital and fragmented era, the ownership of content copyrights has become a topic worthy of deep consideration. The Oriental Sanshifen Incident, not only a media storm, but also a profound reflection on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As observers, how should we view this collision between culture and commerce? While pursuing commercial interests, how can we protect and respect the creative labor of creators? These questions are worth deep consideration for each of us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Opening of Financial Anti-Corruption</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain-rise/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: will intensify anti-corruption efforts in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector, and thoroughly rectify “the four prevailing tendencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;communist-party-of-china-central-politburo&#34;&gt;Communist Party of China Central Politburo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on September 27, reviewing the Comprehensive Report on the First Round Supervision of the First Session of the Twentieth Party Congress. Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, chaired the meeting. The meeting emphasized that the supervision and oversight work should be used as an opportunity to further strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party in all aspects, urging supervised party organizations to raise their political stance, conscientiously fulfill the responsibilities and missions assigned by the Central Committee, continuously enhance the core functions and competitiveness of state-owned enterprises, consolidate the important material and political foundations of socialism with Chinese characteristics, intensify financial institutions&amp;rsquo; service to the real economy and national strategies, and promote high-quality development. It was stressed to coordinate development and security, firmly establish bottom-line and limit thinking, adopt effective measures to prevent and mitigate major risks, and safeguard the safety line.  It was also necessary to advance comprehensive Party self-discipline to greater depths, consolidate the responsibility of the secretary of the党委 (party committee) as the first person, strengthen the responsibilities of leadership committees members “dual duties in one position,” and enhance the supervision responsibilities of disciplinary and supervisory organizations, highlight strengthening supervision of all levels’ “one leader”, intensify anti-corruption efforts in state-owned enterprises and financial sectors, deeply rectify “four prevailing styles,” deepen reform, improve systems, promote source governance, and facilitate treatment of problems comprehensively. (Xinhua)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating Major Financial Risks! Liu Liange, former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Merchants Bank, has been expelled from the Communist Party.
According to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision, with the approval of the Communist Party of China, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision initiated an investigation into Liu Liange’s serious violation of disciplinary and illegal acts as the former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon investigation, Liu Liange lost his ideological conviction, betrayed his original mission, was firm and resolute in implementing the decisions and plans of the Communist Party Central Committee, failed to guard against financial risk prevention responsibilities, recklessly intervened in loan projects and issued loans illegally, causing major financial risks, was ineffective in fulfilling his role as the main body of comprehensive self-discipline of the Party, seriously damaged the political ecology of his unit, privately brought prohibited books into the country, plotted against organizational scrutiny; ignored the spirit of the Eight Rules, accepted gifts and valuables illegally, visited private venues, and received skiing and tourism arrangements; failed to report personal matters in accordance with regulations, did not truthfully explain when questioned by the organization, showed favoritism in appointing and promoting personnel; violated regulations regarding commercial operations; illegally interfered with capital lending, secretly retained confidential materials; was morally corrupt, had an improper family style, failed to properly manage his relatives and educate them; lacked a bottom line of discipline and law, abused power, “ate from finance,” used his position for the benefit of others in loan financing, project cooperation, and illegally accepted huge amounts of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu Liange seriously violated the Party’s political conduct, organizational conduct, integrity conduct, work conduct, and lifestyle conduct, constituted serious disciplinary violations and was suspected of criminal offenses related to illegal loan issuance and fraud, and did not curb or restrain himself after the 18th Party Congress, had a severe and adverse impact, warranted serious handling.

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision reported: According to a report from the Guiyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Zhi Ming, former Party Secretary and Chairman of Guiyang Rural Commercial Bank, was suspected of serious violation of discipline and law and is currently under investigation by the Guiyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>China’s COVID-19 lockdown easing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-coronavirus-end-lockdown/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 19:22:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-coronavirus-end-lockdown/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The policy announcement was incredibly sudden, and its implementation was swift – the Health Code QR code was lifted, and checks for green codes in public places ceased. Browsing the Chinese-language version of The New York Times, the entire front page was dominated by discussions about China’s reopening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t comment on the policies; I’m simply recording what’s happening around me. Originally, Beijing had no zero-COVID policy, but the relaxation of restrictions spread rapidly, resulting in widespread infections. Among my friends, none were seriously ill. Shenzhen, bordering Guangzhou, also began to develop quickly. As I write this, with colleagues based in the suburbs of Shanghai, there haven’t been any large-scale outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back home, the protective measures were minimal, and they spread rapidly. Most people likely experienced a similar feeling – suddenly, restrictions were lifted, with new policies announced weekly until a full reopening was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s undeniable that the three years of zero-COVID policy had an effect; we must adapt to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Pelosi Visits Taiwan</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t know politics, don’t make comments, record this “carnival” on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;musings&#34;&gt;Musings
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Tangshan Assault Incident&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Primary School Textbook Cultural Invasion Incident&lt;/strong&gt; – I wonder how many people even remember them anymore. These trending news stories have become numbingly commonplace, without much feeling, and I just watch TV as usual after work, observing the spectacle. The economic situation is already dire; a war wouldn’t make things any better.  I don&amp;rsquo;t understand politics or offer commentary, simply recording this internet-fueled “carnival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wiki-overviewhttpszhwikipediaorgwiki2022e5b9b4e58d97e8a5bfc2b7e8a3b4e6b49be8a5bfe8a8aae5958fe58fb0e781a3&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E5%B9%B4%E5%8D%97%E8%A5%BF%C2%B7%E8%A3%B4%E6%B4%9B%E8%A5%BF%E8%A8%AA%E5%95%8F%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Wiki Overview&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nancy Pelosi visit to Taiwan, also known as the Pelosi visit to Taiwan, refers to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s 2022 visit to Asia, specifically her itinerary which included a stop in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the U.S. House Speaker being considered the third-highest official in the United States and plans to visit Taiwan, the date was approaching shortly before the Chinese People&amp;rsquo;s Liberation Army&amp;rsquo;s (PLA) 70th Founding Day on August 1st, and long-term it approached the Communist Party of China’s Twentieth National Congress, the 2022 U.S. elections, and the 2022 Taiwan local elections. The government of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China issued a strong protest, dispatching destroyer task forces to the northeast waters of the Taiwan Strait and mobilizing the Shandong and Liaoning aircraft carrier strike groups, with the Eastern Theater Command and Southern Theater Command conducting large-scale live-fire exercises in the East Sea and South China Sea respectively. On the U.S. side, the Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier strike group arrived around the Taiwan Strait to guard Pelosi’s possible visit itinerary, and multiple waves of reconnaissance aircraft and aerial refueling tankers were deployed on standby at Japan&amp;rsquo;s Camp Hikawa Air Base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden had a video meeting before the visit, which covered the issue of Taiwan. Taiwanese and international media reported that Speaker Pelosi and the House delegation would arrive at Songshan Airport in Taipei on the 2nd, stay overnight, and meet with Taiwan’s Presidential Office level officials including President Tsai Ing-wen on the 3rd. Some analysts believe this visit could potentially lead to a new crisis in the Taiwan Strait, similar to the 1996 Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis, after 26 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;08-11&#34;&gt;08-11
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By today, this has pretty much settled down. During this time, the headlines were dominated by various naval exercises, and Zhihu was putting in a lot of effort to update its trending charts every day, talking about all of this. Let the reporters work hard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Shanghai Fen Yong Guo (Shuang Yang Pot) Lockdown</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-sealed/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 23:03:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-sealed/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The leadership team insisted for two days that Shanghai wouldn’t be locked down, that Shanghai was important. But in the end, facing the reality or to preserve their own prestige, they came up with a strategy of closing across the Huangpu River first for a period of time, and then locking down this side of the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lockdown&#34;&gt;Lockdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I experienced the SARS epidemic and have very little memory of it. After seeing related materials, it ended because its incubation period was short and there wasn’t a nationwide spread yet. I remember being in primary school back then, with classes ending early every day, and the smell of disinfectant always lingering in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 has been raging for almost three years. Workers who travel abroad have become accustomed to it, wearing masks when they need to. The recent wave of outbreaks in Shanghai has repeatedly fluctuated, originating from Hong Kong and then spreading across the border into Shenzhen, and here in Shanghai was due to a surge of imported cases from Hong Kong. The official announcement stated that the spread of the epidemic was caused by inadequate protection measures at quarantine hotels, and the mutated virus had reduced its toxicity but increased its transmission speed through ventilation systems in hotels. Initially, it wasn’t very serious and could be contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are often confident. Shanghai&amp;rsquo;s leaders were like that too. They would choose to implement grid-based risk control with us for precise containment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lockdown-1&#34;&gt;Lockdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can all see from the results, the new cases have already exceeded 20,000, leaving us with no choice but to implement a lockdown. Notably, it didn’t use the word “lockdown” externally, as it had previously stated during a press conference that Shanghai did not need a lockdown, in order to preserve its last shred of face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grocery-shopping&#34;&gt;Grocery Shopping
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delivery industry is a new emerging sector driven by the internet. The core of it relies on someone delivering groceries for you, right? However, due to widespread lockdowns in many areas during the pandemic, merchants could operate but no one was available to deliver, which removed the final link in the chain. People outside of this may not fully understand – how could a cosmopolitan metropolis like Shanghai, with its residents going everywhere, all rush out to buy groceries together en masse? In reality, most people are also migrant workers who come here to work and live in rented apartments, typically eating at company canteens or restaurants, rarely cooking at home. When this route becomes blocked, those with the means will start buying groceries. Because this lockdown announcement was not made in advance, people didn&amp;rsquo;t have much food or vegetables stored up, which led to the chaotic rush to buy groceries seen in the video. In that situation, gathering together directly resulted in a resurgence of the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;industry&#34;&gt;Industry
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of us are working in the IT industry. I experienced the impact of the pandemic, getting a taste of remote work. Back in 2019, I stayed at home for almost a month, changing my train tickets back and forth ten times, with no certainty about when I would be able to return to Shenzhen.  I can’t even imagine how those people in the catering, tourism, or many service industries have been getting by these past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Capital Monopoly and the Demise of the Online Education Industry</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:59:08 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent two trading days have seen a significant downturn in the stock market, exposing newcomers to the risks of the market. China is about to enter an aging demographic phase, and birth rates are dismal, with the decline exceeding the estimates of relevant experts, hindering industries that obstruct declining birth rates; the Party will take decisive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-student-burden&#34;&gt;Reducing Student Burden
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of us born in the 1990s didn’t have as many interest classes or tutoring sessions; after school, we would run wild playing. This was first due to the limitations of our families&amp;rsquo; conditions and second because tutoring centers hadn’t yet established a brand effect, convincing parents to trust them. Twenty years have passed in a flash, and since 2019, the capitalization of K12 education has seen the rise of online tutoring companies like猿辅导 (Yuancu Tu), bolstered by capital, which have created various high-end tutoring centers by concentrating excellent resources. Despite exorbitant fees, parental enthusiasm remains unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of urbanization, many parents see education as a path to escape the constraints of the peasantry and achieve a social class leap. As cogs in the machine themselves, they don’t have much time to care for their children, not only because they are highly competitive but also because they don&amp;rsquo;t want their children to fall behind their peers. “It’s difficult for nobles to become commoners,” and with ordinary education levels, it is hard for families in China to maintain their current social standing or make another class leap. If they enter vocational high schools, in today’s society, they believe this represents a downward slide in social status, which is something most parents cannot accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-student-burden-1&#34;&gt;Reducing Student Burden
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit the reasons behind extracurricular tutoring and why parents seek it out. Textbook knowledge and example problems are straightforward – many students can understand them easily. However, many subjects cover broad concepts superficially without delving deeply. The talent selection mechanism requires differentiation, leading to a contradiction: exam questions based solely on textbook knowledge cannot effectively filter candidates. This necessitates horizontal and vertical expansion of learning. These areas are aspects that teachers simply cannot cover in the classroom, creating the fertile ground for extracurricular tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document contains numerous clauses and specifications, outlining multiple aspects and providing a summary of the guiding document’s outline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely reduce the total amount and duration of homework assignments to alleviate students&amp;rsquo; excessive workload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the level of after-school services offered by schools to meet diverse student needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strictly govern extracurricular training activities and comprehensively standardize their behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significantly enhance teaching and learning quality to ensure that students master what they learn at school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen supporting governance and improve support capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully organize and implement it, aiming for tangible results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;elite-education&#34;&gt;Elite Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a phenomenon in the education sector – the increasing prevalence of powerful private schools. Public schools are struggling to provide sufficient high-quality resources (leading to enclaves/gated communities). Various sized educational groups are attracting excellent teachers with high salaries, establishing quality learning environments, and gradually building their own brands, most notably: &lt;strong&gt;Hen Shuai Model&lt;/strong&gt;. Old Home Corporation averages over 3000 RMB, powerful private primary schools charge between 9000 and 10000 RMB per year. Educational groups form a virtuous cycle – my tuition is expensive, but the teachers are excellent, students achieve good grades, I raise tuition fees, and parents will still send their children here. Public resources (teachers) are gradually being drawn to private schools, ultimately becoming synonymous with substandard education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;algorithmic-optimization&#34;&gt;Algorithmic Optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is data showing that Meituan’s contracted delivery riders have approached 4 million, with approximately 400,000 active riders. Many people rely on this job to support their families and livelihoods. The relentless algorithmic pressure to minimize delivery times reduces individuals into measurable units, feeding them into algorithms for constant calculation, continually exploring the boundaries of delivery rider collapse. Believing themselves clever, &lt;strong&gt;they violate human nature and serve capital.&lt;/strong&gt; The market operates here, allowing everyone to play and enjoy sustainable play, rather than &lt;strong&gt;monopolizing, wielding privileges, the gameplay of capitalism, a reckless and brutal growth that will ultimately come to an end&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility&#34;&gt;Stock Market Volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 2021, education stocks represented by New Oriental performed a dramatic plunge, followed by Hao Pai Futures in the pre-market session. &lt;strong&gt;Stock prices plummeted by half.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has gradually entered an aging population, and various social phenomena affecting family planning must be rectified; monopolistic and overtime internet companies were fined, and the capital-concentrated education industry was also scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility-1&#34;&gt;Stock Market Volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The education industry is not allowed to be capitalized on; a single vote directly negated related industries&amp;rsquo; IPO financing, and there was wailing everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

        <title>US-China Trade War</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-china-trade-war/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with some tangential points, the differences between Chinese-style socialism and capitalism. From the mouths of the older generation, we heard that to get rich, you first needed to build roads. China&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure construction – these things are all funded by the state, and in a capitalist society, they would be contracted out. In remote areas, there’s no profit motive, so companies wouldn’t willingly take on those projects. Talking too much is getting off-topic, and ordinary people might feel that trade wars don&amp;rsquo;t have much impact on their lives. However, China’s high-end manufacturing has always been relatively weak. The IT industry I work in – memory, hard drives, CPUs, graphics cards – the core configuration of assembling a computer comes from factories abroad. These components account for 50% of the total cost, and high-end manufacturing is undoubtedly essential. The collision between China and the United States is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Trade War Between the US and China Starting in 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &gt;Made in China 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;2018-2020 China–United States trade war (often referred to as the “China–United States trade war,” “US–China trade dispute,” “US–China trade friction,” or “US-China trade war”) was a trade war between the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade dispute originated when U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on March 22, 2018, claiming that &amp;ldquo;China is stealing US intellectual property and trade secrets,&amp;rdquo; and under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, imposing tariffs on goods imported from China totaling an estimated $600 billion. On July 6, 2018, the U.S. imposed additional tariffs of 25% on $340 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the United States. The Ministry of Commerce of China retaliated in kind with a 25% additional tariff on $340 billion worth of U.S. goods exported to China, including soybeans, the largest export product from the United States to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides had temporarily reached an agreement to pause the trade war in May 2018 and issued a joint statement seeking reconciliation. However, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative subsequently released its first list of tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the United States on June 16, raising the existing 10% tariff to 25%. The China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) then retaliated with equivalent measures, and the Ministry of Commerce of China also restarted anti-dumping investigations into various U.S. products exported to China. On July 6, the Trump administration formally implemented tariffs on the first list of $340 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the United States, marking the formal implementation of Trump’s trade policy towards China (the remaining $160 billion was subsequently added with a 25% tariff on August 23). The Ministry of Commerce of China stated afterward that &amp;ldquo;The United States violated WTO rules and launched the largest trade war in economic history.&amp;rdquo; The General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) indicated that China’s counter-measures were implemented immediately after the U.S. imposed tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 1, at the G20 Buenos Aires Summit, leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump agreed to hold a nine-month negotiation and suspend new trade measures during the negotiation period. After the deadline of March 1, 2019, the U.S. side announced significant progress and extended the suspension of new trade measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs of 25% on approximately $200 billion, totaling $250 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the United States, which took effect on June 1. On May 13, the China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) announced that tariffs on $600 billion worth of imported U.S. products would be raised to a range of 5% to 25%, starting from June 1. On June 1, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced that the implementation date for tariffs of 25% on U.S. goods would be postponed to June 15, and SAFE stated that China’s tariff measures took effect as scheduled on June 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 29, leaders Xi Jinping and Trump held a meeting at the G20 Osaka Summit, agreeing to restart economic consultations, with the United States ceasing to impose new tariffs on Chinese products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 1, due to concerns about China’s purchasing process of U.S. agricultural products, Trump announced on Twitter that tariffs of 10% would be imposed on the remaining $300 billion worth of all Chinese goods shipped to the United States starting September 1, 2019. On August 5, the Renminbi exchange rate against the US dollar fell below 7 yuan. The same day, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that China was designated as a currency manipulator. Subsequently, the Chinese government announced a suspension of purchases of U.S. agricultural products and announced tariffs of 10% or 5% on approximately $750 billion worth of U.S. goods, and resumed tariffs on U.S. automobiles and parts, while the U.S. side responded by increasing the tariff rates on its existing $300 billion Chinese goods to 15%, and its current $250 billion Chinese goods to 25% as retaliation, but these measures were subsequently shelved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 16, 2&lt;/p&gt;
