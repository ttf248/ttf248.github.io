        <title>Trade war abruptly called a pause</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of trade war tariffs in 2025 presented a “escalation – counter-repressive measures – negotiations” cycle, with the US-China rivalry shifting from tariff confrontation to competition over rules. Despite short-term easing that alleviated market pressure, long-term uncertainty remains, and it’s crucial to monitor WTO rulings, supply chain adjustments, and geopolitical shifts&amp;rsquo; sustained impact on the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don’t earn money beyond their own cognitive expectations; the stock market crash triggered by the launch of the trade war this year has largely been recovered, but countless small investors have been buried along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2025 Trade War Tariff Timeline Overview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a timeline of the trade war tariff events, combining key events involving the US and China, and other countries, to present the dynamic evolution of tariff policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-april-2025-comprehensive-upgrade-and-countermeasures-on-tariffs&#34;&gt;I. April 2025: Comprehensive Upgrade and Countermeasures on Tariffs
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Tariff Measures Against China&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2nd:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trump administration signed Executive Order No. 14257, announcing the imposition of a 34% “retaliatory tariff” on goods exported from China to the U.S., covering products originating in Hong Kong and Macao.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 8th:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States further increased the “retaliatory tariff” rate on Chinese goods from 34% to 84%, and signed Executive Orders No. 14259 and 14266, imposing tariffs on additional products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 10th:&lt;/strong&gt; The White House amended the executive order, increasing the total tariff amount against China to 145%, and raising the tariff rate on small packages (such as goods priced below $800 from 90% to 120%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s Countermeasures&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 4th:&lt;/strong&gt; China announced the imposition of a 34% tariff on all goods originating in the United States, covering sectors such as agricultural products, automobiles, and energy. - &lt;strong&gt;April 10th&lt;/strong&gt;: China will retaliate against the tariff rate increase from 34% to 84%, in sync with the US side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 12th&lt;/strong&gt;: China cancels the additional tariffs imposed on U.S. goods by 91% (corresponding to some of the cancellation by the US side) and suspends the implementation of 24% tariffs for 90 days, retaining 10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-april-2025-comprehensive-tariff-upgrade-and-countermeasures&#34;&gt;I. April 2025: Comprehensive Tariff Upgrade and Countermeasures
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariff Games Involving Other Countries&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US-Canada Trade War:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States imposes 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum products, and Canada retaliates by taxing goods worth $298 billion from the US, as well as filing a WTO dispute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EU &amp;amp; Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; The EU imposes maximum 25% tariffs on US goods, while Japan expresses concern over auto tariffs imposed by the US, calling the trade war “harming both sides.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-may-2025-geneva-talks-and-tariff-de-escalation&#34;&gt;II. May 2025: Geneva Talks and Tariff De-escalation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US-China High-Level Trade Talks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 10-11:&lt;/strong&gt; The US and China held a 16-hour meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, reaching the “Joint Statement on the US-China Economic Dialogue” (also known as the Geneva Accord).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 12:&lt;/strong&gt; Both sides announced a suspension of some tariffs:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United States paused its 24% tariff on Chinese goods (for 90 days), retaining 10%, and rescinded the additional tariffs imposed on April 8th and 9th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China simultaneously suspended its 24% retaliatory tariffs, retaining 10%, and lifted non-tariff measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishment of a Consultation Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Both sides agreed to hold regular trade consultations in China, the United States, or a third country, focusing on tariff reduction and rulemaking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Impact &amp;amp; Policy Adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Domestic Pressure:&lt;/strong&gt; High tariffs led to the closure of small and medium-sized enterprises (such as Amazon sellers forced to close due to tariff surges) and rising inflation expectations (core PCE is expected to rise to 3…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-other-key-events-and-long-term-impacts&#34;&gt;III. Other Key Events and Long-Term Impacts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WTO and Multilateral Responses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canada and China both lodged WTO disputes against the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and “retaliatory tariffs,” alleging violations of non-discrimination principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTO Director-General Azevedo warned that U.S. tariffs could cause a 1% contraction in global trade volumes by 2025, exacerbating difficulties for developing countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exemption Lists and Industry Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Excluded Goods:&lt;/strong&gt; A 37-page list covering strategic materials such as rare earths, graphite, and medical CT balls exposed supply chain vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto Tariffs:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on imported automobiles, leading to an estimated 2% decline in global auto production and a 9% reduction in North American output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political and Strategic Maneuvering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration attempted to reshape the international trade order through “retaliatory tariffs,” but was criticized as unilateral bullying, triggering backlash from allies (such as the EU and Japan).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The United States imposes additional tariffs of 34% on goods from Hong Kong and Macau.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;April 8th&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The United States raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 84% and added new executive orders.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;four-timeline-summary-2&#34;&gt;Four. Timeline Summary

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;April 10th&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;China retaliates by imposing a 34% tariff, later raised to 84%; the US adjusts tariffs to 145%.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;April 12th&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The United States waived some goods (such as technology products), China lifted 91% of the counter-tariffs.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;May 10-11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;US-China talks in Geneva, reaching a joint statement on suspending tariffs by 24% (90 days).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;four-timeline-summary-5&#34;&gt;Four. Timeline Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;May 12th&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Both sides announced a suspension of tariffs and the establishment of a consultation mechanism, easing trade tensions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;five-trends-and-challenges&#34;&gt;Five. Trends and Challenges
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short-Term Relief and Long-Term Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; The suspension of US-China tariffs sent positive signals, but structural issues (such as high technology and energy) remain, with midterm elections or policy continuity impacting the medium term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Supply Chain Restructuring:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies are accelerating adjustments to their supply chains, with Mexico and Southeast Asia benefiting from “nearshoring,” but rising costs may dampen recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilateral Mechanism Dilemmas:&lt;/strong&gt; The WTO dispute resolution mechanism is limited, regional trade agreements (such as the US-UK agreement) are emerging as alternative options, but this could exacerbate fragmentation.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>2020-2025 Jiangxi Province Special Postdoctoral and National Civil Service Teacher Recruitment Data: Trends and Insights into Transformation</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;2020-2025 Years: The recruitment of teachers in Jiangxi Province shows a significant reduction trend: the number of specially appointed teachers decreased sharply from 6,617 to 32 (a decrease of 99.5%), and the number of national cadre teachers decreased from 11,324 to 2,146 (a decrease of 81.1%). The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, mathematics, and English) remained stable but declined in total volume; while the proportions of music, art, and physical education increased, the absolute number was limited (e.g., in 2025, they were only recruited 2 people each). Policy-wise, “one withdrawal, one replacement” personnel adjustments have tightened, with teacher resources leaning towards vocational training and remote areas, traditional primary and secondary school positions have significantly reduced, and some subjects plan for zero recruitment in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recruitment numbers of specially appointed teachers in Jiangxi Province over the past five years have been collected and compiled into a table, categorized by subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— ——————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on recruitment announcements and publicly available data released by the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and other official agencies, the following summarizes the recruitment situation for contracted teachers and civil servant teachers from 2020-2025. Please note that &lt;strong&gt;2025 data represents planned recruitment numbers&lt;/strong&gt;, and some years’ subject breakdowns are not fully disclosed; subjects marked as “unspecified” in the table represent total figures or missing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-data-description&#34;&gt;III. Data Description
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Source&lt;/strong&gt;: Recruitment announcements and official statistics from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education and the Department of Human Resources and Social Security for the past years (actual recruitment numbers for 2020-2024, planned numbers for 2025).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject Categories&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special Post Teachers focus on subjects at rural primary education stages; only a small number of subject posts are retained in 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Personnel Teachers cover all academic levels and have a more comprehensive curriculum, including preschool education and special education (due to data not being segmented, these were not listed separately).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trend Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharp Decline in Total Numbers&lt;/strong&gt;: The recruitment quota for Special Post Teachers decreased by 99.5% compared to 2020 in 2025, and the recruitment quota for National Personnel Teachers decreased by 81.1%, reflecting demographic changes and adjustments to educational resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot vs. Cold Subjects&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of core subjects (Chinese, Mathematics, English) remained stable but declined year on year in terms of recruitment numbers. - The proportion of disciplines such as Audio-Visual Arts, Information Technology, etc., is rising, but the absolute number remains limited (e.g., only 2 people recruited in Audio-Visual Arts each year by 2025).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some subjects (such as English) are facing suspensions due to declining student numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Background:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightening of Enrollment:&lt;/strong&gt; Implementing a “withdraw one, fill one” policy, strictly controlling the addition of new positions, with external positions accounting for 68.6% in 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Adjustment:&lt;/strong&gt; Teacher resources are leaning towards vocational education and remote areas, while recruitment in traditional primary and secondary schools has significantly decreased.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The number for some subjects (such as Information Technology) is planned at 0 in 2025, and actual recruitment may be supplemented through adjustment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject classifications may vary from year to year (e.g., “Moral and Rule of Law” merged with “Ideology and Politics”), please refer to the official announcement for the specific year.&lt;/li&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Beijing Children’s Hospital “4+4” project (4 years non-medical bachelor&amp;rsquo;s + 4 years medical doctorate) focuses on interdisciplinary elite cultivation. The exposure of Dong Xi Ying’s case in 2025 revealed her leveraging family background (medical/scientific research lineage) to enter the program, raising concerns about the ambiguity of her qualifications, allegations of plagiarism in her dissertation, and exposing a conflict between the project&amp;rsquo;s elite recruitment model and fairness. Issues regarding shortened study durations and internship training remain unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog: Harmony 4+4 Origin and Development, Core: A Corner of Tian Gong, Seen by Mortals, Dong Xiaojie&amp;rsquo;s Family Background, Normal Medical Doctor Cannot Graduate in Eight Years, Dong Xiaojie’s Family and Educational Background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harmony-44-deconstructing-medical-educations-tian-gong&#34;&gt;Harmony 4+4: Deconstructing Medical Education&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Tian Gong&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “4+4” project at the Beijing Union Medical College, since its launch in 2018, has been viewed as China’s “Tian Gong” – or celestial palace – in medical education. This project, designed to mimic the American medical education system, adopted the philosophy of “cultivating multidisciplinary individuals, nurturing loving doctors, and attracting outstanding talents from across the nation.” It aimed to create a rift within traditional Chinese medical education by: &lt;strong&gt;replacing the traditional 5+3+3 (five-year bachelor’s degree + three-year master’s degree + three-year doctoral degree) model with a four-year non-medical undergraduate program plus a four-year medical doctorate training.&lt;/strong&gt; This was intended to cultivate cross-disciplinary leadership talent in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project&amp;rsquo;s “Tian Gong” attributes are reflected across three dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elite Recruitment:&lt;/strong&gt; Early requirements stipulated that applicants must come from QS/Times/US News top 50 universities or US News’s top 10 liberal arts colleges (such as Barnard College), later relaxed to the top 100, but still requiring a GPA of 3.6 or being within the top 30% of their class. &lt;strong&gt;Internationalization of Learning Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopting an organ-system integration curriculum in the American style, PBL (Problem-Based Learning) methodology, students must complete core courses such as anatomy and pathology within 4 years, and participate in clinical internships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controversy Regarding Export Quality:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the pass rate for practicing physicians (95.2%) is slightly lower than that of traditional eight-year programs (98.5%), graduates predominantly enter affiliated hospitals, and their career development shows no significant difference from traditional pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dong-xiying-incident-a-celestial-realm-crack-revealed-by-ordinary-eyes&#34;&gt;Dong Xiying Incident: A &amp;ldquo;Celestial Realm&amp;rdquo; Crack Revealed by Ordinary Eyes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, the extramarital affair involving Xiao Fei, a thoracic surgeon at Zhongdayu Hospital, and his wife was reported, inadvertently exposing the “mysterious veil” of the 4+4 project at Xinhua Hospital. The background of Dong Xiying, the person involved, sparked three key questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambiguity Regarding Educational Background:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Over Undergraduate Institution:&lt;/strong&gt; Dong Xiying claimed to have graduated from Columbia University, but actually attended Barnard College (ranked 14th in US News &amp;amp; World Report for liberal arts colleges in 2025). Although the school met Xinhua Hospital’s requirement of “top 20 liberal arts colleges,” its diploma simultaneously listed &amp;ldquo;Barnard College&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Columbia University,&amp;rdquo; which could be easily misinterpreted as Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s main campus in the domestic recruitment market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Over Professional Field:&lt;/strong&gt; An economics undergraduate degree combined with a clinical medicine doctorate path, while aligning with the 4+4 project’s positioning of “multi-disciplinary background,” was questioned for lacking foundational courses in pre-medical studies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dong-xi-ying-incident-peering-through-the-heavenly-palace-crack--a-glimpse-for-ordinary-people&#34;&gt;Dong Xi Ying Incident: Peering Through the &amp;ldquo;Heavenly Palace&amp;rdquo; Crack – A Glimpse for Ordinary People
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Family Background:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academic Resource Monopoly:&lt;/strong&gt; Her father was the secretary of the China Metallurgical and Research Institute, her mother was a deputy director of the North Science University Engineering Technology Research Institute, her grandfather was an academician in the imaging field of Xinhua Medical Institution, and her uncle and aunt were foreign academicians in the materials field at North Science University. This “medicine + research + university” composite family background provided implicit resources such as recommendation letters (requiring recommendations from two biomedical associate professors) and research collaborations (such as North Science University patents).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career Path Leaps:&lt;/strong&gt; She transitioned from cardiac surgery during residency to urology, with research spanning orthopedics, gastroenterology, radiology, and other fields. This was questioned as “paved road” due to the rapid changes in her career path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exaggerated Controversy Over Study Duration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasonableness of Time Compression:&lt;/strong&gt; Traditional medical doctorates require 11 years (5+3+3), while the 4+4 program compressed the time to 8 years. Despite Harmony emphasizing “curriculum integration” and “early clinical exposure,” some physicians pointed out that its clinical internship period (12 months) is still less than the traditional eight-year program (18 months), potentially impacting skill accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Controversy Regarding CCT Reduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Some CCT bases allowing 4+4 graduates to have a year of CCT reduced are being questioned for undermining industry fairness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-medical-education-quagmire-behind-the-controversy&#34;&gt;The Medical Education Quagmire Behind the Controversy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dong Xiying incident reflects deep contradictions within Chinese medical education:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict between Elitism and Equity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “application-assessment” model of the 4+4 program is essentially a transplant of the American medical school model, but China lacks standardized exams like MCAT, relying instead on subjective evaluations such as recommendations and research experience, which are significantly influenced by family background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data shows that among graduates of the 4+4 program in 2023, 30% came from Qingbei Fuzhou (the top universities), and 25% from overseas prestigious schools. The influence of family background on applications is significant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reality of Curriculum Reform:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cost of Time Compression:&lt;/strong&gt; 4+4 students produce significantly fewer research outputs (such as the number of publications) than traditional eight-year programs, and are accused of “prioritizing clinical work over research.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divergence in Industry Recognition:&lt;/strong&gt; Three-tier hospitals prioritize the reputation of Covance (the name of the top medical school), while基层医院 (jīchéng yīyuàn – primary hospitals) maintain a cautious attitude towards the clinical abilities of 4+4 graduates. - &lt;strong&gt;The Confusion Surrounding the International Integration of Medical Education&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The US 4+4 model requires passing the MCAT exam and completing a 3-7 year residency, while China’s 4+4 programs have simplified the entry and residency stages, leading to “form resembling but not being” the real thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data from the Ministry of Education shows that in 2024, 4+4 programs accounted for less than 5% of national medical doctorate admissions, and their large-scale promotion still faces resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-reconstructing-the-tiangong-order-of-medical-education&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Reconstructing the &amp;ldquo;Tiangong&amp;rdquo; Order of Medical Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding the CoHo 4+4 project fundamentally represents a clash between elite education and public expectations. When a corner of the “Tiangong” (Heavenly Palace) was glimpsed by mortals, it exposed not just isolated instances of flaws, but deeper contradictions within the entire medical education system. Future reforms must focus on three levels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparent Selection Mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; Introduce standardized exams (such as a Chinese version of MCAT) to reduce the influence of subjective factors like letters of recommendation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extend Clinical Training Cycle:&lt;/strong&gt; Restore the clinical training cycle for 4+4 graduates to 3 years, ensuring that clinical competence is achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen Process Oversight:&lt;/strong&gt; Establish an academic integrity review mechanism and conduct rigorous originality verification for interdisciplinary research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical education’s “Tiangong” should not be a privilege reserved for a select few, but rather a true cradle for nurturing medical elites.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tariff storm, stock market crash</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/tariffs-storm-stock-market-crash/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 03:49:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/tariffs-storm-stock-market-crash/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the global stock markets have experienced significant volatility, primarily due to new measures announced by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding a new round of comprehensive tariffs, which has triggered market concerns about a global trade war and economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariff Policy Sparks Market Panic&lt;/strong&gt;
President Trump announced last week the imposition of high tariffs on all imported goods, with up to 50% tariffs added on imports from China, aimed at correcting what he termed an unfair global trading system. This move led to panic selling across global markets as investors worried that escalating trade tensions would stifle global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Stock Markets Plunge Sharply&lt;/strong&gt;
In the United States, major indices suffered heavy losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,200 points, the Nasdaq Composite declined by 4%, and the S&amp;amp;P 500 dropped 3.8%, entering bear market territory. Asia and Europe were no exception, with the Nikkei 225 in Japan down nearly 8% and European stocks down 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investors Seek Safe-Haven Assets&lt;/strong&gt;
Faced with market turmoil, investors have been turning to safe-haven assets such as bonds and the Japanese yen. However, the VIX (Volatility Index) surged to above 60, indicating heightened market panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economists Warn of Stagnation Risk&lt;/strong&gt;
Economists warn that trade policies could lead the U.S. economy into “stagflation” – a situation where economic growth stagnates, inflation rises, and unemployment remains high.  JPMorgan has raised the probability of a US recession in 2025 to 60%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reactions from Governments and Corporations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments around the world have indicated they will take retaliatory measures. For example, the European Union’s trade chief stated that tariffs would be imposed on U.S. goods starting April 15th. Businesses have also expressed concerns, with Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs raising the probability of a U.S. economic recession to 45%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the global market is facing unprecedented challenges, and investors must closely monitor trade policy developments and market fluctuations, and implement effective risk management and asset allocation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spring Festival box office *Ne Zha* goes viral/breaks out</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-nizha-breakthrough/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 03:40:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/chinese-new-year-nizha-breakthrough/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation of the provided Chinese text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As Chinese people, every Spring Festival, we gather with our families for reunion dinners and watching movies has become an indispensable entertainment activity. This year’s Spring Festival box office hit, &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt;, exploded out of its niche, sparking discussions on streets and in alleys. The scale is impressive, reminiscent of the previous blockbuster, &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, carrying a strong patriotic theme that inexplicably evoked a sense of national pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article, topic: The explosive popularity of &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt; at the Spring Festival box office, the inexplicable sense of national pride, similar to older films like &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt;, with a patriotic theme. While there has been significant progress, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t reached this level. As gamers, many aspects seem greasy, and the combat scenes are heavily influenced by online games. There have already been people who bought movie tickets for &lt;em&gt;Ne Zha&lt;/em&gt; but didn’t actually watch it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-combat-scenes-lacked-a-certain-feel&#34;&gt;The combat scenes lacked a certain feel.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a gamer, I spend most of my time immersed in various online games, so I didn’t have high expectations for movies. However, with the immense popularity of &lt;em&gt;The Battle Between Heaven and Earth&lt;/em&gt;, everyone around me was talking about it, and I thought, “Let me take a look.” When I entered the cinema, as soon as the screen came on, my heart sank. Although the production quality had improved compared to before, some scenes looked a bit greasy. Specifically, the combat scenes… well, they were too heavily influenced by games. Having played so many years of games, these visuals and certain scenes felt too similar to what I was used to in games, lacking the texture and feel that a movie should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crazy-fanatics&#34;&gt;Crazy Fanatics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the movie, I went out to see what was happening online. Turns out, quite a few people said they bought tickets for &lt;em&gt;The Soul of the Demon&lt;/em&gt; purely to boost its box office revenue. This is impressive – I have to admit I’m somewhat impressed! It seems that everyone&amp;rsquo;s enthusiasm and support for this film is incredibly high, and they were willing to do something for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storyline&#34;&gt;Storyline
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s reflect on it: back when &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt; came out, Wu Jing shouted “Anyone who dares to harm China will be punished, no matter how far away,” and countless people felt a surge of patriotism, believing that our Chinese military was incredibly powerful and our country immensely strong. Although &lt;em&gt;The Battle Between Heaven and Earth&lt;/em&gt; didn’t have such a direct patriotic slogan, it vividly showcased traditional Chinese culture. Characters like Nezha and Ao Bing, mythological figures we&amp;rsquo;ve grown up hearing stories about since childhood, had their feuds, loves, and growth journeys depicted with flesh and blood in the film – isn’t that the charm of Chinese culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take Nezha as an example. He was misunderstood and ostracized from a young age, but he refused to give up, shouting “My destiny is not determined by others, but by myself,” which resonates so strongly with the resilience deep within every Chinese person. No matter what difficulties we face, we don&amp;rsquo;t bow down; we change our fate through our own efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advancements-in-animated-films&#34;&gt;Advancements in Animated Films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;The Fire on the Mountain&lt;/em&gt; (Nezha) had some imperfections, it effectively combined traditional Chinese culture with modern film techniques, allowing us to see significant progress in Chinese animated films. Just as &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated China’s breakthrough in the action film genre. This kind of advancement makes us feel that Chinese cinema can emerge onto the international stage and allows foreigners to witness the brilliance of Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chinese people, no matter where we go, we carry our nation and culture within us. Films like &lt;em&gt;Nezha&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior&lt;/em&gt; are like keys that unlock the deep-seated sense of national pride within us. They allow us to feel the strength of our country and the charm of our culture while laughing and enjoying ourselves, inspiring us to work hard in our respective roles and contribute our share to the prosperity and flourishing of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;Public Housing Fund (Prudential Loan) Interest Rate Will Be Reduced by 0.25% Starting Tomorrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First-Time Homebuyers Down Payment Ratio Reduced to 15%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;300 Billion Yuan in Guaranteed Affordable Housing Repurchase Loans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cancellation-of-national-level-first-and-second-time-home-purchase-mortgage-interest-rate-policy-lower-bounds&#34;&gt;Cancellation of National-Level First and Second-Time Home Purchase Mortgage Interest Rate Policy Lower Bounds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, Shanghai Headquarters, branches of the provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and planned cities; state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and all joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to implement the decision-making deployment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, adapt to the new supply and demand relationship in China’s real estate market and the new expectations of the people for high-quality housing, and promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, the following matters regarding adjustments to commercial personal mortgage interest rate policies are hereby notified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancellation of the lower bound on interest rates for commercial personal mortgages for first-time and second-time home purchases at the national level. Here’s the English translation of the provided text:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“II. The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China (PBOC) branches at provincial levels, in accordance with the policy of ‘fine-tuning,’ guide provincial interest rate pricing self-regulatory mechanisms, based on the market conditions and regulatory requirements of each city within their jurisdiction. Financial institutions autonomously determine whether to set lower limits for commercial personal housing loan rates and levels within those limits (if applicable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;III. Banks and financial institutions should, in accordance with the interest rate limits established by provincial market interest rate pricing self-regulatory mechanisms (if any), rationally determine the specific interest rate level for each loan, taking into account the institution’s operating conditions and customer risk profiles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-personal-housing-mortgage-loan-interest-rates-by-025-percentage-points&#34;&gt;Reducing Personal Housing Mortgage Loan Interest Rates by 0.25 Percentage Points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, Shanghai Headquarters, branches of the People’s Bank of China in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and planned special-purpose cities; policy banks, state commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People’s Bank of China has decided to reduce personal housing mortgage loan interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, effective May 18, 2024. The interest rates for first-time and second-home personal housing mortgage loans with a term of less than 5 years (including 5 years) will be adjusted to 2.35% and 2.85%, respectively.  The interest rates for first-time and second-home personal housing mortgage loans with a term of less than 5 years (including 5 years) will also be no lower than 2.775% and 3.325%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;down-payment-ratio-adjusted-to-no-less-than-15&#34;&gt;Down Payment Ratio Adjusted to No Less Than 15%
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, Shanghai Headquarters, branches of the People’s Bank of China in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and planned unitary cities; the Regulatory Bureau of the National Financial Supervision and Administration; all state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and all joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement the decision-making deployment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, to adapt to the new supply and demand relationship in China’s real estate market and the new expectations of people for high-quality housing, and to promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, the following notification is issued regarding matters related to personal mortgage loans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For residential households purchasing commercial personal mortgages for primary residences, the minimum down payment ratio for primary residence mortgages has been adjusted to no less than 15%, while the minimum down payment ratio for secondary residence commercial personal mortgages has been adjusted to no less than 25%. Based on this, the branches of the People’s Bank of China and various affiliated institutions of the National Financial Supervision and Administration Commission, according to the housing control requirements set by local governments, and adhering to a principle of “fine-tuning based on local conditions,” independently determine the minimum lower limits for commercial personal housing loans for first-time and second-time homebuyers in each respective city within their jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-central-bank-will-establish-a-30-billion-yuan-guarantee-housing-refinancing-loan&#34;&gt;The Central Bank Will Establish a 30 Billion Yuan Guarantee Housing Refinancing Loan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 4:00 PM, representatives from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the People’s Bank of China, and the National Financial Supervision and Administration Commission gathered at a routine policy briefing by the State Council to introduce measures to effectively ensure contract fulfillment (保交房).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Vice Governor Tao Ling announced that the central bank will establish a 30 billion yuan guarantee housing refinancing loan to support local state-owned enterprises in purchasing completed but unsold commercial properties at reasonable prices for use as self-built or rental-based affordable housing. This is expected to drive bank loans by 50 billion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the People’s Bank of China, the guarantee housing refinancing loan term can be extended up to four times annually with a rate of 1.75%, aimed at 21 nationwide banks. It incentivizes banks to lend to local state-owned enterprises selected by city governments to purchase completed but unsold commercial properties for use as affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Starch noodles and roadside stalls: The new influence of capital’s news.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/sausages-and-street-vendors-capital-news-influence/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 00:31:58 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;315 actually did not report on “chicken mud,” and this issue itself has been confusing the official exposure of CCTV’s 3·15 Evening Gala with other food safety hotspots that occurred concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zhihu-answer-journalismhttpswwwzhihucomquestion648967411answer3433834122&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.zhihu.com/question/648967411/answer/3433834122&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zhihu Answer: Journalism&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;315 Evening Party presented nine manufacturers in total, none of which included potato starch intestines. Now those nominated major brands have completely lost heat, and the potato starch intestines – a national-level snack (basically found on almost every street food stall across the country with a large number of stalls – is brought out to speak, making it feel like the potato starch intestines are being scapegoated entirely. I looked at online news sources, including CCTV News&amp;hellip; - On the 15th, a news article was published about investigations into ham sausage. It simply listed the ingredients of several manufacturers, and many of these companies weren&amp;rsquo;t primarily producers of starch sausage. There were no obvious issues with the ingredients themselves. Then, a reporter obtained information from a factory employee who said that sometimes chicken bone meal was used instead of chicken meat – something that had been rumored. She then went to pet food stores on Taobao to ask if it was safe for humans to eat chicken bone meal, which is essentially a ridiculous question! Isn&amp;rsquo;t this a stupid issue? A pet food company wouldn’t dare tell you it’s okay for people to eat it. Subsequently, rumors spread that all starch sausage contained chicken bone meal, and chicken bone meal is harmful to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently, it appears many factories are likely to be shut down, and tens of thousands of small vendors across the country face the situation of having products they can&amp;rsquo;t sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-life&#34;&gt;Real Life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Xiaoxiang Morning News on March 17th, the day after the “starchy sausage collapse” incident in Sanmenxia, Henan, a grandmother set up a stall selling starchy sausages two days later, but after two hours, she still didn’t attract any customers and ultimately ate the sausages herself. The photographer said that he himself could eat four or five starchy sausages at once, but after learning that the starchy sausages contained chicken bone mud, he refused to eat them. That day, he was curious whether anyone would still buy the sausages after they were exposed, and he saw that the vendor didn’t sell a single sausage in two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aunt didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about the starchy sausage incident; she only knew that suddenly no one was buying her grilled sausages that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grandmother was right; she was just trying to make a living, and the grandmother didn’t even know if the product had any problems or whether it was qualified, nor did she know what bone mud was. She didn&amp;rsquo;t know about the internet; she was simply a bottom-level person finding ways to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    &gt;Zhihu Answer: Regulatory Restrictions&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, on an afternoon, my colleague who had migrated to Beijing and back (北漂 - Běi Piao) and I went out for lunch. We passed by a small stall selling grilled sausages and sizzling beef strips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I casually said, “With all this black technology starch sausage and beef strips around, will people even still eat them?” Because in my view, the last time I ate starch-based ham sausage was probably about fifteen years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague hesitated and then tactfully said, &amp;ldquo;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because you live in a big city. In our hometown, small places, pickled cabbage, instant noodles, and ham sausage are just everyday staples.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I was in school, my dad would only let me have a grilled sausage on the way home if I got full marks on an exam. It wasn’t because they weren&amp;rsquo;t hygienic; it was simply that a sausage cost 1.5 yuan, which could buy two pounds of green vegetables.” “The way people casually refer to instant noodles, carbonated drinks, and spicy snacks as ‘junk food’ – I only heard about that after moving to Beijing for school.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized my previous careless words were arrogant and fell silent. But this incident left a strong impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this is the everyday life of most Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lives don&amp;rsquo;t include fancy things like the “Mediterranean diet,” “green organic vegetables,” or “non-GMO soybeans.” They simply care about whether they can afford some cheap and tasty vegetables, meat, and snacks, and enjoy the few moments of happiness their family has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They scrutinize the ingredients of what’s on the shelves – what they&amp;rsquo;re made of, whether they might harm their health, and if they contain any strange chemical components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s simply not something they should be concerned with or understand.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Zhihu Answer: Regulatory Issues&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after watching a 315 event, we realized it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case.
Electronic scales and gasoline pumps at gas stations are being secretly modified with high-tech mainboards, requiring content creators to take risks filming videos that could lead to beatings, so regulators can “suddenly realize” and investigate and punish;
&lt;strong&gt;The pork dishes in live streams and starchy tubes from small stalls were actually made with rotten meat and bone meal. It required CCTV reporters to go undercover and film the evidence, which then prompted verification and investigation into the source of the goods.&lt;/strong&gt;
“Health wines” widely promoted on television channels and airport advertisements would only be urgently removed and disappear before consumers if someone filmed and exposed their entire operation.
The annual 315 event always removes five or six products that have been sold for a long time – is that enough?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Oriental Zhentan Short Essay Incident: A Collision of Culture and Commerce</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/dongfang-zhenxuan-essay-controversy-culture-vs-commerce/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oriental Zen Selection short essay incident was a online uproar triggered by Oriental Zen Selection’s official account denying that anchor Dong Yufei was the author of all the short essays. The truth is now unrecoverable, and the company&amp;rsquo;s power struggles have pushed this matter into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish’s seven-second memory will be handed over to &lt;code&gt;AI&lt;/code&gt; for writing, having experimented with &lt;code&gt;Bing AI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ChatGPT Plus&lt;/code&gt;. The former provided more complete information, while the search engine still obtained more data, but the output blog content was not as complete and had a rigid format; the latter generated content based on keywords, which wasn’t as complete but could obtain full blog content. If given the URLs of reference materials, it could optimize the generated article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dongyu Hui incident, involving Oriental Select’s short essay event, was a dispute centered around copyright and creative ownership. Beginning on December 5th, 2023, it involved a series of interactions between anchor Dongyu Hui and Oriental Select. This storm not only revealed the complexities of commercial operations but also sparked profound reflections on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-5-2023-event-origin&#34;&gt;December 5, 2023: Event Origin
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongyu Hui, a host from Oriental Zhentan, quickly went viral after reciting “short essays” in a pre-release video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oriental Zhentan stated in the video comments that most of these short essays were created by the copywriting team and not entirely from Dongyu Hui’s own hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-13-2023-dong-yufeis-response&#34;&gt;December 13, 2023: Dong Yufei’s Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Yufei published a lengthy article opposing the defamation of anyone under the guise of “fan circles,” stating her position on the matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-14-2023-management-response&#34;&gt;December 14, 2023: Management Response
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dong Xuhe (CEO of Oriental Zhensheng) released an apology video, admitting to management loopholes within the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yu Minhong (Chairman of Oriental Zhensheng) also responded to the incident, expressing apologies to Dong Yuhui.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-16-2023-major-decisions&#34;&gt;December 16, 2023: Major Decisions
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongqian Select officially removed Sun Dongxu from the CEO position, with Yu Minhong assuming the role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the same day, Yu Minhong published an apology letter, stating that he would unblock users who had been banned from live streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;december-18-2023-dong-yufeis-new-role&#34;&gt;December 18, 2023: Dong Yufei’s New Role
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Oriental Education &amp;amp; Technology Group appoints Dong Yufei as Chairman and Cultural Assistant of New Oriental Education &amp;amp; Technology Group, concurrently serving as Vice President of New Oriental Culture &amp;amp; Tourism Group.
-俞敏洪 (Yu Minhong) revealed that he will establish a studio with Dong Yufei to open new live broadcast accounts and live rooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-and-reflection&#34;&gt;Conclusion and Reflection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This storm was not only a dispute over copyright and creative ownership, but also deeply reflected the collision between culture and commerce. In today’s digital and fragmented era, the ownership of content copyrights has become a topic worthy of deep consideration. The Oriental Sanshifen Incident involving Xiaowen (Little Essay) was not just a media storm, but also a profound reflection on contemporary commercial culture and online society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As observers, how should we view this collision between culture and commerce? While pursuing commercial interests, how can we protect and respect the labor results of creators? These questions deserve our deep consideration by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Prelude to Financial Anti-Corruption</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: will intensify anti-corruption efforts in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector, and thoroughly rectify “the four prevailing tendencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chinese-communist-party-politburo&#34;&gt;Chinese Communist Party Politburo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on September 27th, reviewing the “Comprehensive Report on the Situation of the First Round of Inspection of the Twelfth Collective Congress.” Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, chaired the meeting. The meeting emphasized that the inspection and oversight work should be used as an opportunity to further strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party of China, encourage inspected party organizations to raise their political stance, conscientiously fulfill the responsibilities and missions assigned by the Central Committee, continuously enhance the core functions and competitiveness of state-owned enterprises, consolidate the important material and political foundations of socialism with Chinese characteristics, intensify the financial sector’s service to the real economy and national strategies, and promote high-quality development. It was stressed that development and security should be coordinated, a bottom-line thinking and extreme thinking approach should be adopted, and effective measures should be taken to prevent and mitigate major risks, firmly safeguard the safety red line. To further advance the comprehensive and strict Party self-discipline towards greater depths, we must consolidate and strengthen the responsibility of Party Committee Secretaries as the primary persons in charge, the “dual-tasks” responsibility of leading members of the Party’s Leading Groups, and the supervisory responsibilities of disciplinary and inspection organizations. We must highlight strengthening oversight of all levels of “principals,” intensify anti-corruption efforts in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector, thoroughly rectify “four prevailing styles,” deepen reform and governance based on cases, promote corruption prevention, elimination, and aversion, and advance the integrated promotion of daring to be corrupt, not being corrupt, and not wanting to be corrupt. We must earnestly implement the Party’s organizational guidelines in the New Era, strengthen leading group construction, personnel talent team building, and grassroots Party organization building. We must comprehensively utilize the results of oversight, deepen reform and improve systems, promote source governance, and facilitate targeted and comprehensive solutions. (Xinhua)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Created Major Financial Risks! Former Chairman of China Bank, Liu Liange, has been expelled from the Communist Party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;communist-party-of-china-central-politburo&#34;&gt;Communist Party of China Central Politburo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of China, with approval from the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of China has initiated an investigation into the serious disciplinary and illegal conduct of Liu Liange, former Secretary of the Disciplinary Committee of the People’s Bank of China and Chairman. - Following investigation, Liu Liange abandoned his ideals and beliefs, betrayed his original aspirations and mission, lacked determination and integrity in implementing the Central Committee’s decision-making and deployment, compromised on key issues, and recklessly interfered with credit projects, illegally disbursed loans, causing significant financial risks. He failed to fulfill his responsibilities as a leading body for strict Party discipline, seriously disrupted the political ecology of his unit, privately brought prohibited materials into the country; deliberately resisted organizational review; ignored the spirit of the Central Committee’s Eight-Point Regulation by accepting gifts and presents, entering private clubs, and receiving skiing and tourism arrangements; long-term use of management objects&amp;rsquo; vehicles; failed to report personal matters in accordance with regulations, did not truthfully explain issues when questioned by the organization, shielded unqualified personnel in recruitment and promotion; engaged in illegal commercial activities; illegally interfered with capital lending, privately retained confidential materials; corrupted morals, improper family ethics, neglected supervision and education of relatives; lacked ideological bottom line and abused power, “eating off financial resources” by exploiting his position for personal gain in loan financing, project cooperation, and illegally obtained large sums of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;central-committee-of-the-communist-party-of-china&#34;&gt;Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu Liange seriously violated the Party’s disciplinary rules and regulations, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, work discipline, and lifestyle discipline, constituting a serious violation of Party discipline and involving suspected bribery, illegal loan issuance, and criminal offenses. Furthermore, after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, he did not renounce illicit gains or curb his corrupt practices, which was of severe nature, had a bad influence, and warranted serious handling. In accordance with relevant provisions of the &lt;em&gt;Disciplinary Rules of the Chinese Communist Party&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Administrative Procedure Law for Public Office Personnel&lt;/em&gt;, after deliberation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) convened at its plenary meeting and approval by the CPC Central Committee, a decision was made to expel Liu Liange from the Party; cancel his benefits in accordance with regulations; terminate his eligibility as a delegate to the Twenty-First National Congress of the Communist Party of China; recover his illegally obtained income; and transfer his suspected criminal issues to the Public Prosecutor’s Office for investigation and prosecution, along with related assets. - The former secretary of the Party Committee and chairman of China CITIC Group was dismissed from party membership and public office for serious violations and abuses of power (CCTV News).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and National Supervisory Commission reported that, according to a statement from the Guizhou Provincial Commission for Discipline Investigation and Supervision, Li Zhi Ming, former secretary and chairman of Guizhou Bank, is suspected of seriously violating and abusing his position and is currently under disciplinary investigation and supervision by the Guizhou Provincial Commission for Discipline Investigation and Supervision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-an-eight-year-hiatus-huijin-boosts-holdings-in-the-big-four-banks&#34;&gt;After an Eight-Year Hiatus, Huijin Boosts Holdings in the Big Four Banks
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 11th, Industrial Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and Construction Bank – the four major state-owned commercial banks – respectively announced that Huijin Company had increased its holdings, totaling 276.1 million shares, 372.7 million shares, 248.9 million shares, and 183.8 million shares, respectively. Huijin Company plans to continue increasing its holdings in the Big Four Banks on the secondary market over the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>China’s COVID-19 lockdown easing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-coronavirus-unlocking/</link>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/china-coronavirus-unlocking/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The policy announcement was incredibly sudden, and the execution was swift – the Health Code QR code was lifted, and checks in public places ceased. Browsing the Chinese-language version of The New York Times, the entire front page was dominated by discussions about China’s reopening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t comment on the policies; I’m simply recording what’s happening around me. Originally, Beijing had no zero-COVID policy, but the relaxation of restrictions spread rapidly, resulting in widespread infections. Among my friends, none were seriously ill. Shenzhen, bordering Guangzhou, also began to develop quickly. As I write this, with colleagues based in the suburbs of Shanghai, there haven’t been any large-scale outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back home, the protective measures were minimal, and they spread rapidly. Most people likely experienced a similar feeling – suddenly, things opened up, with policies changing weekly until a full reopening was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cannot be denied that the zero-COVID policy had its effects; we must adapt to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t know politics, don’t make comments, record this “carnival” on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;musings&#34;&gt;Musings
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Tangshan Assault Incident&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Primary School Textbook Cultural Invasion Incident&lt;/strong&gt; – I wonder how many people even remember them anymore. These trending news stories have become numbingly commonplace, without much feeling, and I just watch TV as usual after work, observing the spectacle. The economic situation is already dire; a war wouldn’t make things any better.  I don&amp;rsquo;t understand politics or offer commentary, simply recording this internet-fueled “carnival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wiki-overviewhttpszhwikipediaorgwiki2022e5b9b4e58d97e8a5bfc2b7e8a3b4e6b49be8a5bfe8a8aae5958fe58fb0e781a3&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E5%B9%B4%E5%8D%97%E8%A5%BF%C2%B7%E8%A3%B4%E6%B4%9B%E8%A5%BF%E8%A8%AA%E5%95%8F%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Wiki Overview&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nancy Pelosi&amp;rsquo;s visit to Taiwan in 2022, also known as the Pelosi visit to Taiwan, refers to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s 2022 trip to Asia, specifically her itinerary including a visit to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the U.S. House Speaker being considered the third-highest official in the United States and plans to visit Taiwan, the date was approaching the Chinese People&amp;rsquo;s Liberation Army&amp;rsquo;s (PLA) Founding Day on August 1st, and long-term it was approaching the Communist Party of China’s Twentieth National Congress, the 2022 U.S. elections, and the 2022 Republic of China local elections. The People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China side strongly protested, dispatching destroyer task forces to the northeast waters of the Taiwan Strait and mobilizing the Shandong and Liaoning aircraft carrier strike groups. The Eastern Theater Command and the Southern Theater Command respectively conducted large-scale live ammunition exercises in the East Sea and South China Sea. On the U.S. side, the Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier strike group arrived near the Taiwan Strait to guard against Pelosi’s possible visit to Taiwan, and dispatched several batches of reconnaissance aircraft and aerial refueling tankers to standby at the US Kadena Air Force Base. Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden had a video meeting prior to the visit, which covered the issue of Taiwan. Taiwanese and international media revealed that Speaker Pelosi and the House of Representatives delegation would arrive at Songshan Airport in Taipei on the 2nd, stay overnight, and meet with Taiwan’s Presidential Office leader Tsai Ing-wen and other senior government officials on the 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;08-11&#34;&gt;08-11
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By today, this has pretty much settled down. During this time, the headlines were dominated by various naval exercises, and Zhihu was putting in a lot of effort to update its trending charts every day, talking about all of this. Let the reporters work hard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Shanghai Fen Yong Guo (Shun Duck Soup Pot) Lockdown</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-closure/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 23:03:27 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/shanghai-yuanyang-pot-closure/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The leadership team insisted for two days that Shanghai wouldn’t be locked down, that Shanghai was important. But in the end, facing the reality or to preserve their own prestige, they came up with a strategy of sealing off the area across the Huangpu River first, followed by sealing off the riverbank on this side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lockdown&#34;&gt;Lockdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I experienced the SARS epidemic, and I don’t have many memories of it. Later, when I saw related materials, it ended because its incubation period was short and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a nationwide spread yet. I remember being in primary school back then, and we would finish school very early every day. There was always the smell of disinfectant hanging in the air in the classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the end of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has been going on for almost three years. People working abroad have become accustomed to it, wearing masks when they need to. The Shanghai outbreak has repeatedly fluctuated, originating from Hong Kong and then spreading across the border to Shenzhen, and here in Shanghai, it was due to a wave of imported cases from Hong Kong. The official announcement stated that the spread of the epidemic was caused by inadequate protection measures at the quarantine hotels. Although the mutated virus had reduced its toxicity, its transmission speed had increased, facilitated by the spread through hotel ventilation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lockdown-1&#34;&gt;Lockdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can all see from the results, the new cases have already exceeded 20,000, leaving us with no choice but to implement a lockdown. Notably, it didn’t use the word “lockdown” externally, as it had previously stated in a press conference that Shanghai did not need a lockdown, which was intended to preserve its last shred of face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grocery-shopping&#34;&gt;Grocery Shopping
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delivery industry is a new emerging sector driven by the internet. The core of it relies on someone delivering groceries for you, right? However, due to widespread lockdowns in many areas during the pandemic, merchants could operate but no one was available to deliver, which removed the final link in the chain. People outside of this situation may not fully understand – how could a cosmopolitan metropolis like Shanghai, with its large population, have everyone flocking to buy groceries together? In reality, it’s easy to see that most people are also migrant workers who come from other places to work and live in rented apartments, typically eating at company canteens or restaurants, rarely cooking at home. When this route becomes blocked, those with the means will start buying groceries. Because this lockdown announcement was not made in advance, people didn’t have much food or vegetables stored up as a daily reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;industry&#34;&gt;Industry
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of us are working in the IT industry. I experienced the impact of the pandemic, getting a taste of remote work. Back in 2019, I stayed at home for almost a month, changing my train tickets back and forth ten times, with no certainty about when I would be able to return to Shenzhen.  I can’t even imagine how those people in the catering, tourism, or many service industries have been getting by these past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Capital Monopoly and the Demise of the Online Education Industry</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:59:08 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/capital-monopoly-and-the-fall-of-online-education/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent two trading days have seen a significant stock market decline, exposing newcomers to the risks of the market. China is about to enter an aging demographic phase, and birth rates are dismal, with the reduction exceeding the estimates of relevant experts, hindering industries that obstruct declining birth rates; the Party will take decisive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;student-burden-reduction&#34;&gt;Student Burden Reduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of us born in the 1990s didn’t have as many extracurricular classes, tutoring programs, or the freedom to run wild after school. This was primarily due to our families&amp;rsquo; limited resources, and secondarily because tutoring companies hadn’t yet established a strong brand reputation, making it difficult for parents to trust them. Twenty years have passed since then, and starting in 2019, the K12 education capitalization trend emerged, with companies like猿辅导 (Yuancuizou – literally “Monkey Tutoring”) appearing as online tutoring platforms based on code. With the backing of capital, these companies created various high-end tutoring programs by concentrating excellent resources. Despite exorbitant fees, parents’ enthusiasm remained undeterred. &amp;gt; During the urbanization process, many parents have relied on education as a path to escape from humble backgrounds and achieve a social class leap. As wage laborers themselves, they lack sufficient time to care for their children, adding to their own intense competition and reluctance to see their children fall behind peers. Given the difficulty of rising above one&amp;rsquo;s origins (“noble offspring”) in traditional Chinese society, and the limited options for maintaining or advancing one’s social class without a suitable education, ordinary families find it difficult to sustain their current status or make another upward leap. Enrolling children in vocational schools is seen as an unacceptable slide down the social ladder – a perspective largely held by parents within the current societal environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-student-burden&#34;&gt;Reducing Student Burden
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit the reasons behind extracurricular tutoring and why parents seek it out. Textbook knowledge and example questions are straightforward – many students can understand them easily. However, most subjects cover broad concepts superficially without delving deeply into them. The talent selection mechanism requires differentiation, which leads to a contradiction: exam questions based solely on textbook knowledge cannot effectively filter candidates. This necessitates horizontal and vertical expansion of knowledge. These areas are aspects that teachers simply cannot cover in the classroom, creating the fertile ground for extracurricular tutoring to flourish. The document contains a large amount of content, with thirty detailed regulations covering multiple aspects. The document outline summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comprehensively reduce the workload and duration for students, alleviating excessive academic burdens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance the level of after-school services offered by schools to meet diverse student needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain strict governance, comprehensively regulate external training activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significantly improve educational teaching quality to ensure students master and excel in their studies within the school environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen supporting governance and enhance support capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully organize and implement the measures to achieve tangible results. ## Reducing Student Burden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit the reasons behind extracurricular tutoring and why parents seek it out. Textbook knowledge and example questions are straightforward – many students can understand them easily. However, most subjects cover broad concepts superficially without delving deeply into them. The talent selection mechanism requires differentiation, which leads to a contradiction: exam questions based solely on textbook knowledge cannot effectively filter candidates. This necessitates horizontal and vertical expansion of knowledge. These areas are aspects that teachers simply cannot cover in the classroom, creating the fertile ground for extracurricular tutoring to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;elite-education&#34;&gt;Elite Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a phenomenon in the education sector – the increasing prevalence of powerful private schools. Public schools are struggling to provide sufficient high-quality resources (leading to enclaves/gated communities). Various sized educational groups are attracting excellent teachers with high salaries, establishing quality learning environments, and gradually building their own brands, most notably: &lt;strong&gt;Hen Shuai Model&lt;/strong&gt;. Old Home Company averages over 3000 RMB, powerful private primary schools charge between 9000 and 10000 RMB per year. Educational groups form a virtuous cycle – my tuition is expensive, but the teachers are excellent, students achieve good grades, I raise my tuition fees, and parents will still send their children there. Public school resources (teachers) are gradually being drawn to private schools, ultimately becoming synonymous with substandard education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;algorithmic-optimization&#34;&gt;Algorithmic Optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is data indicating that Meituan’s contracted delivery riders have approached 4 million, with approximately 400,000 active riders. Many people rely on this work to support their families and livelihoods. The relentless algorithmic pressure to minimize delivery times reduces individuals into measurable units, feeding them into algorithms for constant calculation and exploration of the delivery rider&amp;rsquo;s breaking point. Believing themselves clever, &lt;strong&gt;they violate human nature and serve capital&lt;/strong&gt;. The market operates here, allowing everyone to play and enjoy sustainable play, rather than &lt;strong&gt;monopolizing, wielding privileges, capitalist gameplay, and the unrestrained, barbaric growth that will inevitably come to an end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility&#34;&gt;Stock Market Volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 2021, education stocks represented by New Oriental performed a dramatic plunge, followed by Good Future in the pre-market session of the U.S. stock market, with &lt;strong&gt;stock prices halved&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has gradually entered an aging society, and various social phenomena affecting family planning must be rectified; internet companies engaged in monopoly and overtime were fined, and the capital-concentrated education industry was also being scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility-1&#34;&gt;Stock Market Volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The education industry is not allowed to be capitalized on; a single vote directly rejected relevant industries from going public for financing, and there was wailing everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with some tangential points – the differences between Chinese-style socialism and capitalism, from the perspective of older generations who said that to get rich, you first needed to build roads. China’s infrastructure construction – these things are all funded by the state, whereas in a capitalist society, they would be contracted out. In remote areas, there’s no profit motive, so companies wouldn&amp;rsquo;t willingly take on those projects. There’s a lot of rambling going on here, and it’s starting to drift away from the current topic. Ordinary people might think trade wars don’t have much impact on their lives, but in reality, China’s high-end manufacturing has always been relatively weak. The IT industry I work in – memory, hard drives, CPUs, graphics cards – configuring a computer requires core components sourced from overseas factories. These parts account for 50% of the total cost, and the development of high-end manufacturing is essential. The collision between China and the United States is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Trade War Between the US and China Starting in 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &gt;Made in China 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;2018-2020 China–United States trade war, often referred to as the “China–United States trade war” (English: China–United States trade war), or simply “US–China trade dispute,” “US–China trade friction,” “US–China trade conflict,” or “US-China trade war,” was a trade war between the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China and the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade dispute originated when U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on March 22, 2018, claiming that &amp;ldquo;China is stealing American intellectual property and trade secrets,&amp;rdquo; and invoking Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose tariffs on goods imported from China, covering a total value estimated at $600 billion. On July 6, 2018, the United States imposed additional tariffs of 25% on $340 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia-1&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States and China had reached an agreement in May 2018 to temporarily suspend the trade war, and issued a joint statement seeking reconciliation. However, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced its first list of tariffs on Chinese goods shipped to the US on June 16th, raising the existing 10% tariff rate to 25%. The China Tariff Committee subsequently retaliated with equivalent measures, and the Ministry of Commerce of China also restarted anti-dumping investigations into various U.S.-bound products. On July 6th, the Trump administration formally imposed a 25% customs duty on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods shipped to the US from the first list of tariffs, marking the formal implementation of Trump’s trade policy towards China (the remaining $16 billion in goods were subsequently subject to a 25% tariff on August 23rd). The Ministry of Commerce of China stated afterward, “The United States has violated WTO rules and launched what is now the largest trade war in economic history.” According to the General Administration of Customs of China, the Chinese side immediately implemented counter-measures following the implementation of US tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 1st, during the G20 Buenos Aires Summit, leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump reached an agreement to hold a 90-day negotiation and suspend new trade measures during that period. After the deadline of March 1st, 2019 expired, the US side announced significant progress and extended the suspension of new trade measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia-2&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 5, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the imposition of a 25% tariff on approximately $200 billion in Chinese goods, totaling $250 billion, as part of a trade war. The measure took effect on June 1st. On May 13th, China’s Tariff Policy Commission announced that starting June 1st, it would increase tariffs on some imported goods originating in the United States valued at $60 billion to a range of 5% to 25%. On June 1st, the U.S. Trade Representative&amp;rsquo;s Office announced a postponement of the imposition of a 25% tariff on U.S. products until June 15th. China’s Tariff Policy Commission stated that China’s retaliatory tariffs would take effect as scheduled on June 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 29th, the leaders Xi Jinping and Trump held talks at the G20 Osaka Summit, agreeing to resume economic negotiations. The United States agreed not to impose new tariffs on Chinese products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia-3&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 1st, due to the Trump administration’s dissatisfaction with China’s purchasing process of American agricultural products, Trump announced on Twitter that starting September 1st, 2019, tariffs of 10% would be imposed on all US goods imported from China worth $300 billion. On August 5th, the Renminbi exchange rate against the dollar fell below the 7-yuan mark. The same day, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it was designating China as a currency manipulator. Subsequently, the Chinese government announced a suspension of purchases of American agricultural products and on August 24th announced tariffs of 10% or 5% on approximately $750 billion worth of US goods, and restored tariffs on U.S. automobiles and their parts; while the U.S. increased the tariff rate on its $300 billion Chinese goods to 15%, and the current $250 billion Chinese goods to 25% as a countermeasure, but it was subsequently shelved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 16th, 2020, China and the United States signed a Phase One trade agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
