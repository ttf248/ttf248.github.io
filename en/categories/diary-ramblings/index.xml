        <title>AI overuse can lead to some lingering effects.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-overuse-side-effects/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since we’ve established “AI Inspiration Collision Forum,” there’s been a lot of noise – many things, both good and bad – being tried out using AI for recording and publishing, and less time spent on quiet self-reflection. It feels like this is becoming increasingly rare. Moving forward, it would be beneficial to slightly control the output of this section and consolidate it into a monthly magazine format, releasing one article per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is almost like a post-traumatic effect – or a side effect – where efficiency has increased, but the depth and breadth of thought have declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;efficiency-boost-undeniable&#34;&gt;Efficiency Boost: Undeniable
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Seven-Second Fish Sightseeing” column used to be poorly maintained, with only a few hot events covered. Due to laziness, I hadn’t searched the internet for relevant materials or compiled notes. Now that various AI tools are available, all it takes is outlining the key points, and AI can automatically search for related events, generate articles as needed, simply format them, and publish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like a blessing for lazy people – efficiency has increased significantly, almost to the point of doubling effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond writing articles, efficiency gains are real when coding. Previously, writing code often required detailed reading of API interface documentation. Now, I can skip this entirely. This is incredibly valuable because familiarizing oneself with APIs is “physical labor,” not “mental labor.” AI handles this part perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spam-content&#34;&gt;Spam Content
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many articles have poor quality content, not to say that there’s nothing there; it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t read well, lacking a sense of reality and what people actually experience. This is a style I previously disliked – like chewing wax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From another perspective, AI-generated content really does feel like products of a流水线 (liú shuǐ liàn - assembly line) production, lacking soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spam of the New Internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forgetting&#34;&gt;Forgetting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of document is entirely AI-generated, and the reader’s context is unclear. However, over time, my own impressions will become blurred, or even forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar issues occur when writing code – without reviewing commit records, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember how I originally thought about it, or why I wrote it that way. This is particularly evident with code generated through repeated communication with AI, where the final code differs significantly from the initial ideas, sometimes drastically so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;search&#34;&gt;Search
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the number of times I’ve opened Google and Baidu has noticeably decreased. Many questions are now being answered by AI for searching and interaction, and the results are much better than traditional search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s mourn the &lt;code&gt;bing ai&lt;/code&gt;, which may no longer be active, a pioneering AI tool from a major company that could connect to the internet and search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using Google less, and I’ve reduced my visits to &lt;code&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/code&gt; as well – many questions are now simply asked of AI, and this website is gradually being phased out by the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My maintained blog, originally with very little traffic, is now even less expected of; it’s primarily a place for self-reflection and recording.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Town Brahmin: The “Big Man” of Small Places</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2024 23:02:25 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/county-brahmins-big-shots-in-small-towns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, the popular &amp;ldquo;Da Bing&amp;rdquo; (Big Ice) on Douyin (TikTok) has been frequently seen with short video accounts extracted from her live streams. A listener who joined a live call asked: “Da Bing, I want to sell my house in Xi&amp;rsquo;an and return home to settle down.” Da Bing responded: “At your age, you’re in your early thirties; you can’t settle down. Your parents are on the path of aging, your children haven’t started a family or established themselves, and if you return home, you’ll still need to deal with the ‘parameshik’ (婆罗门) in the small county.”
Let&amp;rsquo;s put aside whether the viewpoint is right or wrong, what does the term “parameshik” (婆罗门) mean?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;township-brahmins-the-big-shots-of-small-places&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Township Brahmins: The “Big Shots” of Small Places&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many small county towns, people often talk about so-called &amp;ldquo;township brahmins&amp;rdquo;—the existence of these individuals seems to be a symbol of local society. They are not necessarily genuine religious figures and do not possess “high-level” titles; rather, they are seemingly ordinary but nonetheless influential people. They represent “power, status, and influence” within that county town, symbolizing a particular class or stratum in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-xiancheng-babao&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an “Xiancheng Babao?”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand that “Babao” originally referred to the highest caste in Indian society, representing wisdom, authority, and spiritual supremacy. In China’s county towns, the term “Xiancheng Babao” doesn&amp;rsquo;t have such a complex religious background; it’s more of a metaphor for a social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, an “Xiancheng Babao” can be understood as some “cultural authorities” within the county town – such as teachers, doctors, well-known merchants, and officials, etc. Although their positions may seem ordinary, in this relatively closed environment, they possessed a comparatively higher social status, or their opinions and actions had influence that could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-the-county-town-brahmin&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is the &amp;ldquo;County Town Brahmin&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a county town, there are almost always these “Brahmins” – individuals who hold influence in virtually every industry. They might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educators:&lt;/strong&gt; Particularly teachers with decades of experience locally, who may not have graduated from prestigious universities but understand how to establish credibility through knowledge and are widely respected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Government Officials:&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy county magistrates, section chiefs, etc., who control certain resources and power, even if their positions aren&amp;rsquo;t high-ranking; their limited scope of authority can make them local “Brahmins.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local &amp;ldquo;Entrepreneurs&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/strong&gt; Some business owners in county towns, although not large in scale, hold a certain amount of wealth and have a voice in the region. They might operate one or two well-known local small businesses and wield considerable influence within the county town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-status-of-county-town-brahmins--how-does-it-impact-society&#34;&gt;The Status of “County Town Brahmins” – How Does it Impact Society?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the significance of “county town brahmins,” we must consider the unique environment of the county town. Here, information flow is slower than in large cities, and social mobility is relatively fixed. These “brahmins” often accumulated prestige, knowledge, and connections through long-term dedication to the local area. They influence various aspects of local politics, economics, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; In small places, especially where education systems may not be as developed and people have limited choices, local &amp;ldquo;brahmins&amp;rdquo; subtly shape the cultural atmosphere through knowledge transmission in classrooms, explanations in media, and even moral guidance in social settings. &lt;strong&gt;Concentration of Social Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the limited population and resources in county-level cities, these “Brahman” figures were often one of the primary controllers of local resources. Whether it was social welfare, policy implementation, or the approval of certain projects, they invariably exerted influence. Their power of speech and decision-making allowed them to hold a significant position within the local society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Networked Structure of Interpersonal Relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; In a relatively closed small community, interpersonal relationships are often crucial. These “county Brahman” figures established powerful social networks to control information flow and resource allocation, thereby playing a decisive role at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-metaphor-of-the-county-sharma&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Metaphor of the “County Sharma”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the “county sharma” (often translated as &amp;ldquo;town Brahmin&amp;rdquo;) is frequently regarded with respect and admiration, this position of elevated status isn’t without its issues. In modern society, it&amp;rsquo;s not difficult to observe that many county-level “sharmas” lack genuine ability and innovative spirit; instead, they maintain their positions through hereditary relationships and resource monopolies. With the development of informatization, these “sharmas’” power is gradually being broken down, and new social mobility is beginning to influence the appearance of small counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the “county sharma” is a fascinating social phenomenon that reflects the power and cultural structures within local societies. Although their “power” may not directly threaten national governance, they are undoubtedly key figures within the locality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this would have happened if we hadn’t started with curiosity about what a ‘purohito’ was, then tossed it to ‘kimi’. The result was surprisingly funny – I could see the web interface already pulling up search results, but instantly they were blocked from displaying related content. Then I wondered, did this word hold some special significance? So I passed it on to ‘ChatGPT’, and that&amp;rsquo;s how this article came about.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Getting out for a walk is always good.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/come-out-and-walk-around-its-always-good/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 10:30:43 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/come-out-and-walk-around-its-always-good/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If things had gone as the family planned, I would have stuck to studying power grids honestly and diligently, without venturing into coding. Had I erased the dust from my memory, it all started with a chat with my roommate near the Spring Festival, which led to a review of my experiences over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1&#34;&gt;Chapter 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the college entrance exam couldn’t be described as good or bad; I ended up graduating from a 211 university, and according to my father&amp;rsquo;s initial plan, I should have studied power grids and returned to work for the local power supply bureau in our hometown. There had also been mentions earlier about how to step by step take this path into the IT industry – something that hadn’t been mentioned before: financial views and self-control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to school in a rural town in elementary and middle school, and my family arranged for me to transfer to a school in the city district in middle school, much like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden; there was some initial difficulty adapting to the hustle and bustle of the city. I hadn’t been to a movie theater very often, to be precise, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone to the movies with my parents, but relatives would take me. Heaven always gives you luck; back then, I met several friends who were just like me, although we lost contact later on, that period of my youth is now seen as beautiful. After catching up on tutoring over the weekend, we’d gather to tidy up the classroom, expertly kicking flattened plastic bottles into our backpacks to take back to Mom for storage. As they accumulated, we&amp;rsquo;d find a waste collector to handle them. We’d play chess, badminton, and Mahjong – if I lost, I’d do a few push-ups; it was a small consolation at the time. Dad had been taking me through all sorts of exercises since I was little. At this point, my understanding of money was slightly skewed, and I felt a bit insecure, but these minor setbacks quickly passed. Our family wasn&amp;rsquo;t struggling – we simply didn’t have much pocket money, and sometimes couldn’t join our classmates in their activities, especially on weekends. Seeing our parents’ efforts as we moved from the village to the city… it was like planting a seed, waiting for it to sprout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-one&#34;&gt;Chapter One
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a simple-minded individual, I found my time studying to be generally very happy, much like many people can only truly appreciate after graduating – reading isn’t actually that difficult of a task, and the conversion of investment into output is relatively easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-one-1&#34;&gt;Chapter One
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I absorbed the memories of the Age of Empires era. During university, encountering a laptop was like opening Pandora’s Box – I discovered games and connected with game merchants. Initially, I was a low-level salesperson, sourcing goods upstream and selling them through my own community channels to earn a little money. Later, I gradually understood the operational logic of the entire chain. The products we sold were merely mass-produced by upstream programs, and their costs approached zero. At this time, the road had already started to slant a bit. Within the field of expertise, there were increasingly specialized sub-disciplines: on the left was power grids, and on the right was automation (very complex – chip programming, factory electrical automation). I understood that programs could make money, but it wasn’t a huge sum; the upstream channels definitely made a lot of money. Adding to this my previous foundation in programming, I started experimenting with various things, making a little money here and there. When the time came for specialization, I naturally chose automation. After completing most of my senior-level courses, many of which I didn’t attend, I was constantly thinking about writing code to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year&amp;rsquo;s article mentioned a fascination with hackers, leading me to contact programming. Without formal training in IT, I used compassion to learn assembly language, penetration testing, game cheats, DLL hijacking, and phishing – familiarizing myself with various black-hat and gray-hat products. My parents taught me how to be a good person, which ultimately dissuaded me from completely straying down the wrong path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-1&#34;&gt;Chapter 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous Post Link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/then-boy-talent-not-much/&#34; &gt;That Time When I Was Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a brief relationship during university. Looking back, it was more about yearning for the romance depicted in television dramas. As an immature young man at the time, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand how to love someone, let alone achieve: settling down and starting a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-two&#34;&gt;Chapter Two
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst the torrent of times, I was fortunate – university’s tribulations led me to a direct entry into employment rather than graduate school. Upon graduation, I joined the workforce, riding the wave of IT’s prosperity with smooth and steady progress. Now in my eighth year of work, the industry&amp;rsquo;s speculative heat dissipated, inevitably leading to decline. Sometimes, I question whether my initial choice was correct; perhaps entering a utility company as suggested by my father would have been a better path. If these thoughts were prevalent during the first five years of my career, they gradually faded away with time. Through campus recruitment, I joined HSBC, remaining with the same company for five years without switching roles. This has resulted in certain deficiencies regarding technological understanding, industry knowledge, and self-awareness of one’s capabilities. Following the arrangement of the headquarters in Hangzhou, I went to the Shenzhen branch, experiencing a workplace struggle (after clarifying the situation, both sides lost out, and the board of directors ultimately benefited), returning to Hangzhou with a passion for technology, carrying a touch of youthful naiveté, having run off to Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally planned to settle down in Hangzhou, purchase property, and register, at the highest interest rates and peak housing prices, it was intended to be a trap – my finances were limited and I couldn’t afford it. If I had been burdened with mortgage payments while the industry was declining, my emotions would have become unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-three&#34;&gt;Chapter Three
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having been around for so many years, having seen so much, I’ve made my own mistakes and wasted time, and currently, things are still going well. Experiencing things, experiencing people – it all leads to gradual growth. If you were to stay at home constantly, I wonder what form the flaws in my personality would manifest themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Revenue Generation Business Model: Raffle/Sweepstakes</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/traffic-monetization-business-models-lottery/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 07:04:35 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/traffic-monetization-business-models-lottery/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Live streamers sending iPhones? Mini-program ranking rewards? Various live streaming platform gift giveaways?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three seemingly unrelated items are, in essence, different monetization models for free traffic – a bit like a financial game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;platform-lottery-for-gifts&#34;&gt;Platform Lottery for Gifts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typical scenarios, users reset their acquisition of platform currency and purchase gifts to send to the host, &amp;ldquo;Xin Yi&amp;rdquo; (Hearty), with each platform having another gameplay mechanic. After users acquire platform currency, they no longer directly send gifts but instead spend a certain amount of currency to participate in lottery activities, obtaining limited high-value gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the online lottery is simply understood as the platform opening a casino. With enough participants, it’s guaranteed not to lose money. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;屌丝&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; (literally &amp;ldquo;loser,&amp;rdquo; often used colloquially to describe someone from a lower socioeconomic background) users, fueled by a desire to gamble and win big, hoping to hit a jackpot and then send gifts – gaining face and becoming a “big brother”!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;live-stream-gifts-physical-items&#34;&gt;Live Stream Gifts (Physical Items)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lottery mentioned in the preceding text targets users’ own writing. Each month, the hosts have water flow tasks and popularity tasks. The gameplay of enabling gift giveaways allows fans to send specific gifts or gifts of a specified amount, giving them the opportunity to participate in the lottery. The prizes may include high-end phones or cash red envelopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For popular live streamers, this activity is very profitable, essentially equivalent to a temporary zero-cost purchase. If enough people participate, the streamer also makes money. This tests the streamer’s operational capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s also a gameplay where the rewards are very high (cash value), and many outdoor streamers engage in this type of scheme, which is essentially online gambling. The content of the livestream doesn’t matter; users only care about whether they can win. Excluding live streaming hosts of stage performance types, through PK (peer-versus-peer) modes, inducing fans to consume and recharge, ordinary game streamers are difficult to drive player spending sentiment. Playing games and watching live streams are primarily for entertainment and don’t necessarily lead to additional financial expenditure, especially &lt;strong&gt;competitive games&lt;/strong&gt;. Lottery-style mechanisms can cultivate users&amp;rsquo; charging habits, consumption habits, and occasionally even impulsive purchases (giving away a lot, hoping to win).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mini-program-ranking-rewards&#34;&gt;Mini Program Ranking Rewards
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design a mini program that incorporates some useless workflows or provides partial game-related auxiliary services. The preceding items are all cover stories, designed to pass Tencent’s review by adding a ranking mechanism to the mini program&amp;rsquo;s gameplay – incorporating elements like bringing in some pointless processes or offering part-game related assistance. Users earn points by browsing promotional ads and completing tasks, with a leaderboard established in the background based on these points, rewarding users with designated rewards based on their rank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core Logic: Advertising Revenue &amp;gt; Operational Costs + Reward Expenses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mini program can also operate normally by providing reasonable services and earning revenue through appropriate advertising – this may not yield much profit, but it’s like a trickle, and that&amp;rsquo;s acceptable too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Back then, as a young boy, he might have had talent, but it wasn’t common.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/then-boy-talent-not-much/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 13:45:09 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/then-boy-talent-not-much/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s my seventh year in the job, and I’m not getting as much positive feedback on the code I write. Let me reflect on how I ended up on this &lt;code&gt;coding&lt;/code&gt; path. People’s choices, especially when they&amp;rsquo;re younger, tend to follow positive reinforcement more closely – actively avoiding harm and seeking benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-childhood&#34;&gt;I. Childhood
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving to the city and coming into contact with computer books? Hacker’s materials? Meeting Windows systems – these are all anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The time should be positioned around childhood and sneaking around with my cousin to play games on our parents&amp;rsquo; computers&lt;/strong&gt;, my cousin and I’s uncle ran a shop in a computer store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been exposed to computers from a young age, and the basic understanding was established. Later, in school, taking microcomputer courses also sparked an interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In middle school, I heard about computer competitions, which seemed really cool, but after transferring schools, this fell by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my junior high years, I was familiar with the basics of computer operation, and I could easily be the center of attention in microcomputer classes. If you’re still familiar, yes, you haven&amp;rsquo;t made a mistake – being proficient in office software is even more impressive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-moving--relocation&#34;&gt;II. Moving / Relocation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit the moving situation. When we moved to the city center, due to the neighbors, we came into contact with the library. Although we read quite a few novels, we also read many magazines, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computer News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;大众软件&lt;/em&gt; (Greatest Software)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We became increasingly interested in computers as a product. The childhood admiration for hackers was very active, and we proactively sought out relevant knowledge at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned the basics of operating systems: control panel, CMD commands, VBS scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computer News&lt;/em&gt; is suitable for beginners; each time it presents information in the form of case studies, explaining system operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greatest Software&lt;/em&gt; recommends various software, industry news, and &lt;strong&gt;of course, game news – this was initially our motivation, and it planted the seed for gaming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-high-school&#34;&gt;III. High School
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was in high school, Bo Ge transferred to our class, and &lt;strong&gt;in the previous two years, he secured several predecessors as direct qualifiers for the computer competition&lt;/strong&gt;, which was highly valued by the school leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a foundational hardware base, with an alumnus from America donating a building that became the new library and new computer lab – it all felt incredibly coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with Bo Ge’s popular science education, he was essentially the go-to guy for computers in our class at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scholar + computer master, knew how to hack into other people&amp;rsquo;s computers and disable the classroom surveillance software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-high-school-1&#34;&gt;III. High School
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competitions were bumpy and ultimately ended in the finals, where I didn’t quite understand the material and the questions were mostly basic algorithms. However, it was still a worthwhile experience – like taking a short trip.&lt;/p&gt;

University Arrived – University Major Selection, Following Parental Guidance, Choosing Automation; Actually Wanted to Pursue Power Electronics, Intending to Join the Local Electricity Bureau Upon Graduation. Little Coursework Was Studied, Self-Driven Learning Ability Was Virtually Nonexistent in Professional Courses, Computer Courses Within Large Courses Were Very Easy to Learn. Attended Class Regularly, While Skipping Professional Classes and Diligently Studying Computer Courses; Spent Daily Time on Forums: “JingYi Forum,” “I Love Crack,” Combining What Little Assembly and C++ Knowledge Was Learned from the Forums to Take On-Line Orders for Profit, Receiving Increasingly Positive Feedback, And Gradually Became More Involved – Unable to Be Pulled Back. Eventually, Choosing a Niche Profession – Writing Code for Chips – The Family Didn’t Pay Much Attention, Allowing Me to Choose It Myself. At This Time, &lt;strong&gt;The Third Key Figure: My Cousin&lt;/strong&gt; – High Education, Working at Baidu. Grandma Also Understood Me, Knowing That I Hadn&amp;rsquo;t Been Focused on Research Since a Young Age, So I Talked to Him About It.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;five-graduation&#34;&gt;Five. Graduation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a key point I know – I learned how to bypass firewalls, took elective courses in Computer Information Retrieval, and quickly found and located information and problems. A valuable colleague appeared in my work, &lt;strong&gt;Mr. [硕哥&amp;rsquo;s Pinyin - Shuo Ge]&lt;/strong&gt;, who gave me time to learn independently and troubleshoot issues from the ground up, taking me to meet with the leaders of the R&amp;amp;D center.
These experiences laid the groundwork; in Shenzhen, everyone perceived me as highly capable, successfully leading the transaction channel group.
That’s where the problem lies: I lacked systematic learning in computer operating systems, algorithms, and software engineering design. All my knowledge was based on my own past experience. This led to frequent contradictions and rejections of my code designs, a lack of guidelines for module design, and ultimately, fatigue after seven years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the vast system of Chinese characters, the character “命” (life/fate) is unique; there isn’t even a single homophone. Perhaps this subtly suggests that each person&amp;rsquo;s life has only one opportunity, cannot be replicated, and cannot be relived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During leisure time, I browsed the rankings on Qidian Chinese Net, and “The Nomenclature of Nights” consistently topped the charts with over two million monthly votes, a significant gap from the second-place ranking. Previously, I had primarily read works by well-known authors like Tang Jia San Shao and Ergen; this time, I decided to try a new author’s work to experience a different reading sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of early August, “The Nomenclature of Nights” had amassed two million monthly votes, while the second-place ranking stood at only eight hundred thousand – a staggering disparity that left me speechless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize my knowledge is limited and I lack the ability to critically evaluate the author’s writing style. However, after reading through over a dozen chapters, the book’s plot is tightly paced and intricately linked, captivating readers and earning such high monthly votes – it&amp;rsquo;s truly well-deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, just like the character “ming” (life/fate), the character “si” (death) also doesn’t have any homophones in Chinese characters; does this perhaps also contain a similarly unique and irreplaceable depth of meaning regarding the end of life?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>When you want to make money</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ordinary people are social animals, that’s right – you are an individual, but also a bipedal animal, with strong social attributes; you have feelings of inferiority and vanity, and society is constantly changing and eroding your &lt;strong&gt;everydayness&lt;/strong&gt;. We don&amp;rsquo;t discuss those great figures, those who willingly burn themselves for society or the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-current-situation&#34;&gt;My Current Situation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at average wages or my hometown’s salaries, my current income is significantly above the average – what more could I possibly want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you earn one million, you start thinking about earning one hundred million; once you earn one hundred million, you start thinking about earning a billion. This is natural for ordinary people; we must face our inner selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-current-situation-1&#34;&gt;My Current Situation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s red are the more relaxed ways to make money: short videos. Everyone knows it&amp;rsquo;s not simple to enter an industry. What you see is short video content, but what you don’t see is the behind-the-scenes work of filming and copywriting. But everyone has their own dream – I’m suited for that industry, I was born to be in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting Started
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve watched so many videos. If you analyze a lot of the shots with your own brain, you can clearly see professional editing techniques and strong cinematic elements. Basically, some of them are from people who have formal training – film school graduates, for example. Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s also the logic of grassroots success, but that doesn’t apply to most people, does it?
On TikTok, you’ll also find many videos teaching you how to make videos. At this point, people are starting to wake up. If they could really make money, why would they teach others how to do it instead of doing it themselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anti-human-recommendation-algorithms&#34;&gt;Anti-Human Recommendation Algorithms
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the Douyin algorithm would recommend movie clips and anime clips while I was scrolling. It felt surprisingly engaging, to the point where you’d start to find it interesting yourself. However, when I looked into how Douyin makes money, it started recommending various tutorial videos non-stop, flooding my entire recommendation stream. As someone who also works in the IT industry, this made me feel like the algorithm “big brothers” were having a bit of a problem – you’re essentially suggesting this to me, are you thinking I&amp;rsquo;m stupid or are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; stupid? The key thing is that it keeps finding new ways to recommend videos on how to make money with Douyin, from different angles and across various types. It’s like they’re constantly adapting. This draft was written at 3 AM, and frankly, I didn’t want to write it in the first place. I started wondering how long this business model could last – how much time can you siphon away from people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-clarity&#34;&gt;Finding Clarity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When teaching people how to do things, presenting a set of rules for them and then being unable to control yourself when doing it is ridiculous. As I’m not a purely technical blog writer, I haven&amp;rsquo;t published some things domestically, so here I casually rant. If one day I get banned, that can only be said to move somewhere else. I can’t say I haven’t done anything with Douyin – at least now it actively cooperates in the dissemination of real-time news and the propaganda of national policies, because in our country, you can&amp;rsquo;t defy the Communist Party, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now think back to when you were studying. When you truly can’t find the meaning of life, quietly reading a book is enough. In this era, how many people can still quiet themselves down and quietly read books?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also want to thank the progress of science and technology. If you’re seeing this line, you’ll realize that the entire manuscript is very colloquial. And I really just kept writing and writing it. The input method I usually used was Sogou Input Method, which I&amp;rsquo;d been using for about seven or eight years. However, when it came to voice input, it had to be said that Xunfei was more professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the article number was changed to 002. Why did it have two zeros? There’s a dream – this year I wanted to break the hundred articles, which is just a dream, right? It&amp;rsquo;s not really articles; it’s more like records. I reflect on myself every day, and you must be able to think of some things, right?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often, at some stage in life, people find themselves lost in a haze, unsure of what they truly want. Amidst the mundane routines of work, they gradually lose their pursuit of meaning and purpose. Looking back to when I first graduated, my heart was full of fervent aspirations – I wouldn’t hesitate to say that I longed to write code, to create brilliant, eye-catching code. However, as I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for so long, I’ve had more exposure to business-level affairs, which has largely benefited from the advantages brought about by industry development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of my life philosophy, I haven’t yet incorporated marriage and having children, or establishing a family, into my thinking. My mind is almost empty, simply focused on enjoying the present moment. Whenever weekends arrive, I enjoy quietly playing games, often spending an entire day at home, immersed in my own little world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buying-a-house&#34;&gt;Buying a House
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I was full of enthusiasm, planning to save diligently and buy my own property. I meticulously budgeted every day towards this goal. However, as housing prices continued to skyrocket, my anxiety and resentment gradually turned into numbness, leading me to feel that even if I bought a house, it would simply be a heavy burden on my shoulders. Consequently, I abandoned this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;saving-money&#34;&gt;Saving Money
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, saving money was about achieving some small goals, such as building a high-performance desktop computer, purchasing a long-desired camera, or taking an impromptu trip. However, now I approach saving with a more relaxed and “chill” attitude, no longer worrying too much about daily expenses – I indulge in things I want to eat and boldly try new and exciting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;returning-home&#34;&gt;Returning Home
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I realized that what I most longed for deep down was simply to go home. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything particularly to do, just to return to that familiar place and feel the warmth and tranquility of home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
