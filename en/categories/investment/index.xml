        <title>Trade war suddenly put on hold</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/trade-war-pauses/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of tariffs in the 2025 trade war presented a cycle of &amp;ldquo;escalation — retaliation — consultation,&amp;rdquo; as the US-China competition shifted from tariff confrontation to rules-based competition. While short-term easing alleviated market pressure, long-term uncertainty remains, and it is necessary to monitor the continued impact on the global economy from WTO rulings, supply chain adjustments, and geopolitical changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can&amp;rsquo;t earn money beyond their own understanding. The stock market crash triggered by the trade war this year, even now that losses have been largely recovered, has buried countless small investors along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the timeline for tariffs in trade wars in 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a breakdown of the 2025 trade war tariff timeline, incorporating key events from China, the US, and other countries to illustrate the evolving dynamics of tariff policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-april-2025-comprehensive-tariff-escalation-and-retaliation&#34;&gt;I. April 2025: Comprehensive Tariff Escalation and Retaliation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US tariffs on China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 2, the Trump administration signed Executive Order 14257, announcing a 34% tariff on goods imported from China, covering products from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 8th, the United States further increased tariffs on Chinese goods from 34% to 84% and signed Executive Orders 14259 and 14266, imposing additional tariffs on more products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 10th: The White House revised an executive order, raising the total tariffs on China to 145%, and increasing tariffs on small packages (such as raising the tax rate on goods under $800 from 90% to 120%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s countermeasures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 4th, China announced tariffs of 34% on all goods originating from the United States, covering areas such as agricultural products, automobiles, and energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 10th, China will raise retaliatory tariffs from 34% to 84%, matching the escalation by the US side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 12th: China canceled 91% of the tariffs imposed on US goods (corresponding to the portion cancelled by the US side) and suspended the implementation of the remaining 24% tariffs for 90 days, retaining 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariff disputes among other countries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US-Canada trade war: The United States has imposed a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum products from Canada. Canada retaliated by imposing tariffs on US$298 billion worth of American goods and filed a complaint with the WTO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The EU is imposing tariffs of up to 25% on US goods, while Japan has expressed concerns about tariffs on US automobiles, calling the trade war &amp;ldquo;harmful to both sides.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-may-2025-geneva-talks-and-tariff-easing&#34;&gt;II. May 2025: Geneva Talks and Tariff Easing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China-U.S. High-Level Economic and Trade Talks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From May 10th to 11th, China and the United States held 16 hours of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, reaching the &amp;ldquo;China-US Geneva Trade Talks Joint Statement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 12th: Both sides announced suspension of some tariffs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United States has suspended 24% of tariffs on China (for 90 days), retained 10%, and canceled additional taxes scheduled for April 8th and 9th&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China will suspend 24% of retaliatory tariffs, retain 10%, and remove non-tariff measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both sides agreed to establish a consultation mechanism and regularly hold trade consultations in China, the United States, or a third country, focusing on tariff reduction and rule-making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Impact and Policy Adjustments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US domestic pressure: High tariffs are causing small and medium-sized enterprises to go out of business (such as Amazon sellers being forced to close due to soaring tariffs), and inflation expectations are heating up (core PCE is expected to rise to 3.3%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s rare earth countermeasures: China has tightened controls on rare earth exports, cracked down on smuggling, and impacted the US military industry and new energy supply chain, forcing them to seek waivers for tariffs on rare earths and other key minerals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-other-key-events-and-long-term-impacts&#34;&gt;III. Other Key Events and Long-Term Impacts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WTO and multilateral response&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canada and China have separately filed appeals with the WTO over US steel and aluminum tariffs and &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; alleging violations of the non-discrimination principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned that US tariffs could cause a 1% contraction in global trade volume in 2025 and exacerbate the difficulties faced by developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exemption List and Industry Impact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US exemption goods: A 37-page list covering strategic materials such as rare earths, graphite, and medical CT tubes exposes supply chain vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US tariffs on imported cars of 25% have led to a global forecast of a 2% decline in auto production, with a 9% reduction in North America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political and strategic game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration attempted to reshape the international trade order through &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; but was criticized as unilateral bullying, triggering a backlash from allies (such as the EU and Japan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China is responding to protectionism by expanding market access (such as the China International Import Expo, and zero-tariff commitments) and attracting cooperation from developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-of-timeline&#34;&gt;Summary of Timeline
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Event&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 2, 2025, the United States will impose a 34% tariff on China, covering goods from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 8th, the United States will raise tariffs on China to 84% and introduce new tax administrative orders&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 10, China retaliated with a tariff of 34%, later raised to 84%; the US revised its tariffs to 145%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 12, the United States exempted certain goods (such as technology products), and China canceled 91% of its retaliatory tariffs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;US, China and Japan talks in Geneva reached a joint statement agreeing to suspend 24% tariffs (for 90 days)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On May 12, both sides announced a suspension of tariffs and a negotiation mechanism, easing trade tensions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;five-trends-and-challenges&#34;&gt;Five: Trends and Challenges
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-term easing and long-term competition: The suspension of tariffs between China and the US sends a positive signal, but structural contradictions (such as high technology and energy) remain, and midterm elections may affect policy continuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global supply chain restructuring: Companies are accelerating adjustments to their supply chains, with Mexico and Southeast Asia benefiting from “nearshoring,” but rising costs may dampen the recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The predicament of multilateral mechanisms: The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is constrained, regional trade agreements (such as the UK-US agreement) have become alternative options, but this exacerbates fragmentation&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Tariff storm, stock market crash</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/tariffs-storm-stock-market-crash/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 03:49:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/tariffs-storm-stock-market-crash/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, global stock markets have experienced sharp volatility, primarily due to the new round of comprehensive tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, which has sparked market concerns about a global trade war and economic recession&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariff policies trigger market panic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump announced last week that he would impose high tariffs on all imported goods, with tariffs of up to 50% on imports from China, aiming to correct what he called an unfair global trade system. This move has led to a panic sell-off in global markets as investors worry that escalating trade tensions will stifle global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global stock markets plunged sharply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, major stock indexes suffered heavy losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 1,200 points, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 4% and the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index fell 3.8%, entering bear market territory. Asian and European markets were also not spared, with the Nikkei 225 in Japan falling nearly 8% and European stock markets dropping 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors seek safe-haven assets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with market volatility, investors are turning to safe-haven assets such as bonds and the yen. However, the market volatility index (VIX) has surged above 60, indicating heightened market panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists warn of stagflation risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists warn that tariff policies could lead to “stagflation” in the US economy – a situation where economic growth stagnates, inflation rises, and high unemployment coexist. JPMorgan Chase has raised the probability of a recession in the U.S. economy in 2025 to 60%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions from various governments and businesses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments around the world have stated that they will take retaliatory measures. For example, the EU trade commissioner said that it would begin imposing retaliatory tariffs on US goods on April 15th. The business community has also expressed concerns; Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs have raised the probability of a US economic recession to 45%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, global markets are facing unprecedented challenges; investors need to closely monitor trade policy developments and market changes, and manage risks and asset allocation&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Broad-based index investing: Broker ETF, Hang Seng Tech Index</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/etf-wide-index-dzt-broker-etfs-hangsheng-tech-index/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 21:58:59 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/etf-wide-index-dzt-broker-etfs-hangsheng-tech-index/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to do this – buy a good blue-chip stock and just leave it alone. But I waited for it to fall, didn&amp;rsquo;t add to my position, and sold when it rose. As a result, I never managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s more trouble than it&amp;rsquo;s worth to find suitable blue-chip stocks; instead, just pick a broad market index and buy an ETF. The current plan is: securities ETF, Hang Seng Tech Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trading strategy has a professional term: left-side dip buying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the plan is to choose a broad-based index for thorough practice; it just needs to outperform the returns of fixed deposits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brokerage-etfs&#34;&gt;Brokerage ETFs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securities ETF refers to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with China&amp;rsquo;s securities companies as their primary investment target, primarily investing in listed securities company stocks in the Chinese stock market. Securities ETFs typically track a specific securities company index, such as the Zhongxin Securities Company Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought it before, but I chased after the high price at that time and ended up losing money, so I just cleared out the position. In China&amp;rsquo;s market, every bull market sees securities firms rise; how much they rise depends on the sentiment of investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-technology-index&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Technology Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index is a stock index launched by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, designed to reflect the overall performance of the technology sector in the Hong Kong market. The index includes major tech companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, covering multiple fields such as the internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 20, 2025, the top ten constituents and their respective weightings in the Hang Seng Tech Index (code: 800700) are as follows (data compiled from multiple authoritative sources):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xiaomi Group-W (01810.HK): Approximately 8.82%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tencent Holdings (00700.HK): Approximately 8.14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alibaba Group - W (09988.HK): Approximately 7.72%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JD Group-SW (09618.HK): Approximately 7.60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meituan-W (03690.HK): Approximately 7.35%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kuaishou-W (01024.HK): Approximately 6.10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Auto (02015.HK): Approximately 6.09%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SMIC (00981.HK): Approximately 5.70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NetEase-S (09999.HK): Approximately 4.59%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ctrip Group-S (09961.HK): Approximately 4.48%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 66.6% (Some sources indicate a combined share of the top ten between 68%-69%, with differences due to varying statistical time points)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;important-notes&#34;&gt;Important Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The weighting cap mechanism: The Hang Seng Technology Index sets an 8% upper limit on the weight of individual stocks. For example, SMIC&amp;rsquo;s weighting once exceeded 8% before its March 2025 adjustment, but was subsequently passively reduced to a compliant range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constituent Stock Adjustment: On May 16, 2025, Hang Seng Index Company announced that BYD (01211.HK) will be included in the index and Century Golden Resource (00772.HK) will be removed. The adjustment will take effect on June 6. Therefore, as of today (May 20), the constituent stock list remains the pre-adjustment list, and BYD has not yet been included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Among the top ten constituents, internet technology companies (such as Tencent, Alibaba, and Meituan) are dominant, with significant weighting in new energy vehicles (Xiaomi, Li Auto) and semiconductors (SMIC), reflecting the index&amp;rsquo;s coverage of technology and the new economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data timeliness: Differences in data from different sources are mainly due to varying statistical time points. For example, data from March 2025 shows that the top ten combined accounted for approximately 69.4%, while data from May 14th showed 68.82%, reflecting the dynamic impact of market fluctuations on weighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buy-back-to-cover-losses-on-the-left-side&#34;&gt;Buy back to cover losses on the left side
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;left-side falling price replenishment&amp;rdquo; strategy is an investment approach where, during a period of continuous stock price decline, investors anticipate the price nearing a bottoming zone and proactively purchase in batches to reduce holding costs, awaiting future price rebounds for profit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method falls under the category of &amp;ldquo;left-side trading,&amp;rdquo; which means taking a contrarian position before the market has clearly bottomed out. In practice, investors typically employ a “pyramid” accumulation strategy, gradually increasing their purchase quantity as the price declines to reduce their average holding cost. For example, initially buying a certain number of shares; if the price continues to fall, then increasing the buy volume at a lower price, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce holding costs: By buying in batches during a downturn, average stock cost is diluted, creating conditions for future profits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positioning in advance: Establishing a position before the market reverses; if the judgment is correct, greater returns can be achieved when the market recovers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High risk: Continued decline in stock price may lead to greater losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding requirements: Requires sufficient funds to support continuous replenishment, and may face a situation where funds are locked up for an extended period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively speaking, &amp;ldquo;right-side trading&amp;rdquo; involves entering buy positions after the market trend is clear and there are obvious signs of price recovery, which carries relatively low risk but may miss some of the gains from the early stages of a rebound. Therefore, investors should choose a suitable trading strategy based on their risk tolerance, financial situation, and market judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory&#34;&gt;Valuation theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuation theory is a core concept in finance, designed to assess the intrinsic value of assets or companies and provide a basis for investment decisions. Through valuation, investors can determine whether the current market price of an asset is reasonable and formulate corresponding investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main valuation methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discounted Cash Flow (DCF): This method is based on the expected future cash flows generated by an asset, which are then discounted to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The DCF method emphasizes the intrinsic value of an asset and is suitable for evaluating companies with stable and predictable profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative Valuation: This method assesses a company&amp;rsquo;s relative value by comparing its valuation metrics with those of other companies in the same industry, such as price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-book ratio (P/B), and price-to-sales ratio (P/S). Relative valuation is easy to operate and widely used for quick assessments and comparisons within an industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asset-based approach determines a company&amp;rsquo;s value by assessing its net asset value, which is the difference between total assets and liabilities. This method is suitable for asset-dominant companies such as real estate firms or capital-intensive businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application of Valuation Theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment decisions: Through valuation, investors can identify undervalued or overvalued assets and formulate buy-or-sell strategies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mergers and Acquisitions: In M&amp;amp;A transactions, valuation is key to determining the transaction price and influencing the success or failure of the deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Report: The company needs to assess its assets and liabilities at fair value to ensure the accuracy and transparency of financial reports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that valuation results are affected by various factors, including market conditions, company operating status, and macroeconomic indicators. Therefore, when conducting a valuation, it is necessary to comprehensively consider all factors and combine qualitative and quantitative analysis to obtain more accurate assessment results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Making money takes time; rushing it is useless</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:30:24 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking back on my years of stock trading experience, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t made a lot of money, I haven&amp;rsquo;t lost too much either. The biggest problem lies in the unreasonable capital flow planning and unstable mindset. Currently, my main source of income is work, earning a fixed salary through daily labor, and my tolerance for financial fluctuations still remains at the level of bonds and bank deposits. However, people are greedy; if you buy too little, you won&amp;rsquo;t make money even when prices rise; if you buy too much, you’ll lose money when they fall. At this point, a stable mindset becomes particularly important, as it can help us steady our ship of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing an article: The issue of mentality in stock investment and wealth management&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-loss-cases&#34;&gt;Historical Loss Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides dabbling in small-cap and newly listed stocks when I first started, the subsequent investments have mostly been in blue-chip large-cap stocks: Industrial Bank, China Unicom, Hengan Electronics, ZTE, and various large-cap index funds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They talk about matching bank three-year fixed deposits in terms of annualized returns, but in reality, it&amp;rsquo;s still greed for more, from rushing to increase holdings to eventually experiencing a cash flow shortage. Purchasing insurance, buying a house, and getting married are major drains on funds; the overall planning didn’t leave enough room for cash flow, leading to insufficient funds later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying blue-chip stocks is aligning yourself with &amp;ldquo;Old Money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Evergrande ran into problems, bank stocks plummeted, allowing for a successful grasp of the selling pressure. However, this demonstrates a flawed understanding of the broader economy; real estate&amp;rsquo;s share in the national economy is too large, involving too many things to allow for a &lt;strong&gt;hard landing&lt;/strong&gt;. Subsequently, the stock market continued its decline, and dividend stocks like &lt;strong&gt;Industrial Bank&lt;/strong&gt; rose steadily for about two years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the initial stage of the trade war, &lt;strong&gt;ZTE&lt;/strong&gt; suffered a major blow, with its stock price plummeting significantly, but it gradually recovered afterward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hang Seng Electronics used to be part of a larger group, and the stock price dropped significantly after Ant Financial spun off. However, this stock is controlled by market makers, and it can surge several times each year. With reasonable position control, losses will be minimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;greed-the-monster-that-devours-reason&#34;&gt;Greed: The &amp;ldquo;Monster&amp;rdquo; That Devours Reason
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greed is the most common problem in stock trading psychology. When stock prices rise steadily and investors&amp;rsquo; paper profits continue to increase, greed quietly takes root. Many people, even when the price has already reached a high level, still fantasize about it continuing to rise, eager to obtain more gains, and are reluctant to take profits. They are blinded by greed, forgetting the laws of the market and the existence of risk. For example, in some speculative hype on popular themes, some investors see prices doubling or even multiplying several times in the short term and become deeply involved, continuously increasing their holdings, hoping to be the last winner. However, the market will not remain bullish forever; when the bubble bursts and prices plummet, these greed-driven investors often suffer heavy losses. Greed robs them of their ability to analyze and make decisions rationally, turning them into &amp;ldquo;gamblers&amp;rdquo; in the stock market rather than wise investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-shackles-that-bind-your-hands-and-feet&#34;&gt;Fear: Shackles that bind your hands and feet
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is the opposite of greed. Fear is equally destructive in the stock market. When market conditions turn sharply downward and stock prices fall significantly, investors are easily caught up in panic. This fear causes them to lose confidence in the market, and even if they hold fundamentally sound stocks, they rush to sell at a loss out of fear of further losses. For example, during the global financial crisis, the share prices of many high-quality blue-chip stocks also fell sharply with the broader market. Some investors were overwhelmed by fear, failing to see the long-term value of these companies and selling their shares at extremely low prices, resulting in missed opportunities for substantial returns from subsequent market rebounds and company performance growth. Fear not only causes investors to suffer losses in the short term but can also leave them with a lasting psychological shadow, making them hesitant to re-enter the market and thus missing out on investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blindly-following-trends-a-fog-that-obscures-direction&#34;&gt;Blindly following trends: A &amp;ldquo;fog&amp;rdquo; that obscures direction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stock trading and wealth management, blindly following the crowd is another psychological trap that investors easily fall into. In this era of information explosion, various investment suggestions, market rumors, and hot news abound. Many investors lack independent thinking and judgment skills, blindly following others&amp;rsquo; actions. They see those around them making money by buying a certain stock and impulsively follow suit; they hear so-called &amp;ldquo;insider information&amp;rdquo; and invest all their savings. This blind following behavior ignores the research and analysis of the stocks themselves, leaving investors like ships lost in fog, losing their direction. For example, some concept stocks can indeed bring short-term gains to those who follow the trend at the beginning of market hype, but as the hype fades, the stock price plummets, and those who are uninformed and blindly following become &amp;ldquo;catchers&amp;rdquo; (those who buy after a decline). They fail to realize that each investor has different risk tolerance, investment goals, and investment horizons; an investment strategy suitable for others may not be suitable for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overconfidence-a-hidden-shoal&#34;&gt;Overconfidence: A Hidden &amp;ldquo;Shoal&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence is also a problem that cannot be ignored in the mindset of stock trading and wealth management. Some investors, after achieving several investment successes, begin to become inflated with pride, believing they have mastered the laws of the market and can accurately predict stock price movements. They ignore the complexity and uncertainty of the market, overtrade, blindly expand their investments, and even use high leverage for speculation. However, the market is unpredictable, and investors who are overly confident often suffer heavy losses in an unexpected market fluctuation. For example, some inexperienced but initially successful investors believe they have professional investment capabilities and begin to frequently buy and sell stocks, constantly increasing their investment amounts. When systemic risks appear or individual stocks experience sudden negative news, they fail to stop their losses in time due to overconfidence, leading to a significant reduction in capital. Overconfidence is like hidden reefs beneath the surface of the sea—seemingly calm and harmless, but capable of causing an investor&amp;rsquo;s ship of fortune to run aground and sink unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-and-invest-steadily&#34;&gt;How to adjust your mindset and invest steadily
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a correct investment philosophy: Investors should understand that stock trading and wealth management are for achieving long-term, stable asset appreciation, not getting rich quick. By learning about investment knowledge, understanding market rules, and establishing the principles of value investing and long-term investing, investors can avoid being swayed by short-term gains and market sentiment. For example, thoroughly research a company&amp;rsquo;s fundamentals, focusing on factors such as its profitability, industry position, and management team, to select stocks with long-term investment value rather than blindly chasing short-term trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a sound investment plan: Based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals, formulate a scientific and reasonable investment plan. Clearly define key elements such as investment amount, investment horizon, expected return, and stop-loss point, and strictly adhere to the plan. This can help avoid impulsive decisions driven by emotional fluctuations during the investment process. For example, limit the investment proportion of each stock to a certain percentage of your total assets, take profits when the price rises to meet your expected return, and cut losses decisively when it reaches the stop-loss point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control your emotions and stay calm: When facing market fluctuations, learn to control your emotions and remain calm and rational. You can relieve investment pressure through methods such as diverting attention, exercising, and communicating with others, avoiding negative emotional influences on investment decisions. When the market experiences significant volatility, first calmly analyze the reasons, combine your own investment strategy and stock fundamentals, and make a rational judgment instead of blindly following the trend or panicking to sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous learning and reflection: The stock market is constantly evolving, so investors need to continuously learn new investment knowledge and skills, pay attention to macroeconomic conditions, industry trends, and company information, and constantly improve their investment level. At the same time, they should regularly reflect on their own investment behavior, summarize experiences and lessons, identify problems in mindset and decision-making, and make timely adjustments and improvements. For example, after each investment, review the entire investment process, analyze the reasons for success and failure, and think about how to avoid similar mistakes in future investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in stocks and managing finances is a long and challenging journey, where mindset plays a crucial role. Only by maintaining a rational, calm, humble, and independent thinking approach can investors navigate the ups and downs of the stock market steadily and achieve wealth preservation and appreciation. Investors should regard cultivating their mindset as a mandatory course in the investment process, using a positive attitude to steer their financial ship and ensure long-term success on the path of stock investing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Fund and fixed income wealth management</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/fund-and-fixed-income-wealth-management/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 11:27:06 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/fund-and-fixed-income-wealth-management/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We, those of us born in the 90s, didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel much about the financial crisis of 2008, because we were young and not yet at the age of investing. The bull market in 2015 was grand and spectacular, and its decline was equally dramatic, ultimately requiring intervention from the government to save the market. At the same time, it brought the concept of funds into the view of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ant-financial-and-alipay&#34;&gt;Ant Financial and Alipay
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alipay, as a natural traffic entry point under Ant Group, was positioned as a payment tool from its inception. When it comes to buying funds, most people chose Alipay over WeChat. Alipay successfully transformed fund sales into ordinary shopping. The bull market that started in 2019 and the mutual warming among fund managers were ultimately driven by the monetary easing guided by the pandemic. Those who entered (the market) made money, and those who watched from the sidelines became envious and rushed to enter. The speed at which new funds are breaking through the billion-dollar mark is accelerating. With &amp;ldquo;aunties&amp;rdquo; now starting to buy funds, trillion-dollar funds are not far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the booming popularity of Ant Financial&amp;rsquo;s internet-based fund sales platform, ordinary people typically encountered fund sales only when depositing money at banks, where branch managers would enthusiastically introduce various financial products. The packaging and promotional information on the internet, along with the exorbitant advertising fees paid by fund sales institutions, have made Alipay’s fund advertisements completely detached from reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal bank fixed-term wealth management yields 4%, P2P wealth management, which was popular a few years ago, yielded 8%, and credit card interest rates are 12%. Our protagonist, the fund promoted by Alipay, yields 150% and 250% when the market goes up, making everyone happy. But what about when the market goes down? Alipay is playing with fire. The growth data provided only shows the returns for the past three years on the surface, and established funds only show annualized average returns. Why don&amp;rsquo;t they dare to write out the average annual return each year? Is it because it’s difficult to calculate? The answer is no; it’s because the data isn’t good-looking and doesn’t easily guide customers to buy funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fixed-income-wealth-management&#34;&gt;Fixed income wealth management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;China hasn&amp;rsquo;t entered the era of negative interest rates yet; bank deposits and government bonds are the most secure fixed-income products. Pure bond funds are also good options. You can easily find China’s average salary by checking data released by local statistical bureaus. The author describes a simple scenario: an asset size of 2 million yuan, with an annualized return of 4%, resulting in annual earnings that exceed the average salary in most cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s mostly based on my personal experiences, there’s a lot I could write about. If you want to learn more, I recommend reading books on economics; don’t blindly follow anyone. For ordinary families, the core of financial management is preservation of value, not chasing dreams of getting rich quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle often says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing the right thing at the right time yields the greatest value; studying diligently and obtaining a good education is better than earning pocket money by distributing flyers; working hard when you first graduate can bring substantial returns in salary increases; when starting a family, learn to take care of your home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those interested can take a look at this speech: Regarding time, you need to read many books to find the answer. The text transcript is available on this site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
