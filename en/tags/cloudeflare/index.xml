        <description>&lt;p&gt;This site’s main domain is hosted on GitHub Pages, and the blog’s backup subdomain is on Vercel with acceleration. It has been deployed through Cloudflare. The backend management page looks too outdated and unappealing, which is a major deterrent. Initially, it was a quiet, unassuming piece of content; however, constant messages in the blogging circles disrupted this tranquility – opening it up, CF went down, and many friends’ websites couldn&amp;rsquo;t be accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an internet infrastructure component, such prolonged downtime is unacceptable. The stock price didn’t plummet dramatically, which I hadn’t anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare outage; many well-known websites are inaccessible. Pre-event stock drop, compiling relevant content, outputting articles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 18, 2025 (Tuesday) –&lt;/strong&gt; This morning (November 18th), Cloudflare, a major global internet infrastructure services provider, experienced a widespread network outage before the opening of U.S. markets, causing thousands of well-known websites and applications that rely on its services to become paralyzed or difficult to access worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this incident, Cloudflare’s (NYSE: NET) stock price fell sharply during pre-market trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-outage-affects-global-services-as-popular-platforms-go-down&#34;&gt;🌍 Outage Affects Global Services as Popular Platforms “Go Down”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outage began on Tuesday morning (approximately 7:00 AM Eastern Time, 11:48 GMT) and was reported globally. Users across the world were unable to access a number of popular services including social media platform &lt;strong&gt;X (formerly Twitter)&lt;/strong&gt;, artificial intelligence service &lt;strong&gt;OpenAI (ChatGPT)&lt;/strong&gt;, music streaming service &lt;strong&gt;Spotify&lt;/strong&gt;, game platforms &lt;strong&gt;League of Legends&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Valorant&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as numerous cryptocurrency exchanges (such as BitMEX, DefiLlama), among others.
Users attempting to access these websites generally encountered “500 Internal Server Error” messages. Given Cloudflare’s role as an “intermediary” in the internet, providing content delivery (CDN) and security protection (DDoS) for millions of websites worldwide, any “jitter” within its network immediately triggered a global chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-market-reaction-was-rapid-net-pre-market-stock-drop&#34;&gt;📉 Market Reaction Was Rapid, (NET) Pre-Market Stock Drop
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a key infrastructure component for the internet, Cloudflare’s service stability is of significant interest to investors. Following the release of the outage news, the capital markets reacted quickly. Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s (NYSE: NET) stock experienced heavy selling in pre-market trading on Tuesday. According to financial data, its price fell approximately &lt;strong&gt;3.5% to 4%&lt;/strong&gt;, dropping from a previous day’s close of around $202.25 on November 17th to levels as low as $195.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reflects investors&amp;rsquo; concerns regarding the severity of the service interruption and its potential impact on the company’s reputation and short-term revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-response-issue-identified-and-under-repair&#34;&gt;Official Response: Issue Identified and Under Repair
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s official team quickly confirmed this incident on its System Status page. The company updated the status at 13:09 UTC (November 18th) this afternoon (Beijing time) stating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The issue has been identified and remediation is being implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-official-response-issue-identified-and-under-repair&#34;&gt;🛠️ Official Response: Issue Identified and Under Repair
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cloudflare’s report, this incident has been classified as a “global network experiencing issues” (global network encountering problems) and accompanied by “widespread 500 errors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare stated that they are working to mitigate the issue and have observed service beginning to recover, but cautioned that customers may continue to observe “above normal error rates” during ongoing repair work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, access to some websites has begun to gradually restore, but global network latency and error rates remain high. We will continue to monitor the situation’s further development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
