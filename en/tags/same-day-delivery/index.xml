        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s era of the global digital wave, we&amp;rsquo;ve become accustomed to instant transfers and near-instant payments. Therefore, many people are confused: why, after clicking “sell” on a stock, does my funds not immediately clear in full and become available, but instead takes one or two business days? This is precisely a crucial and historically significant concept within traditional stock trading – &lt;strong&gt;settlement&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prompt: Why does traditional stock trading require the concept of settlement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trading” and “Settlement” are two separate steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading:&lt;/strong&gt; This refers to the moment you place a buy or sell order on an exchange that is successfully matched. At this point, you and your counterparty have reached a legally binding contract committing to exchanging stocks and funds at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settlement:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the process of fulfilling the terms of the agreed-upon contract – namely, the ownership of the stock officially and irrevocably transfers from seller to buyer, while the funds are officially and irrevocably transferred from the buyer’s account to the seller’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for these two separate steps and a time lag (such as T+1, T+2 systems) stems from historical evolution and rigorous risk management in finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-roots-originating-in-the-paper-era&#34;&gt;Historical Roots: Originating in the “Paper” Era
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the widespread adoption of computer systems, stocks were tangible &lt;strong&gt;paper certificates&lt;/strong&gt;. Following a trade executed orally or through gestures at an exchange, subsequent work was incredibly laborious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical Transportation:&lt;/strong&gt; The seller’s brokerage firm needed to retrieve the corresponding stock certificate from its vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endorsement Transfer:&lt;/strong&gt; Signing and endorsing the back of the certificate to verify ownership transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Delivery:&lt;/strong&gt; These certificates and associated checks had to be delivered by personnel (couriers) throughout the city to the buyer&amp;rsquo;s brokerage firm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification &amp;amp; Reconciliation:&lt;/strong&gt; The buyer’s brokerage firm needed to verify the authenticity of the certificates and the accuracy of the transaction details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire process involved a significant amount of manual labor and physical transfer, riddled with delays and uncertainty. Consequently, an settlement cycle of several days (initially as long as T+5) was established to complete these complex processes. In the late 1960s, Wall Street was plunged into a “Paperwork Crisis” due to a surge in trading volume; a large number of trades could not be completed on time, even forcing exchanges to shorten trading hours. This directly spurred the establishment of modern electronic clearing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-core-an-unreplaceable-risk-management&#34;&gt;Modern Core: An Unreplaceable Risk Management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all transactions being electronic today, the T+N settlement system remains in place because its core function has evolved from “waiting for logistics” to &lt;strong&gt;managing the massive risks of the financial system&lt;/strong&gt;. This process is primarily carried out by a key player – &lt;strong&gt;Central Counterparty (CCP) Clearinghouses&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the Depository Trust &amp;amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation (CSDC) in the United States and China, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement system is mainly designed to mitigate the following core risks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;counterparty-risk&#34;&gt;Counterparty Risk
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the most fundamental risk. If you sell shares, how can you be 100% certain that the buyer will pay on time? Conversely, how can the buyer be 100% certain that the seller will deliver genuine shares? If either party defaults, it could trigger a chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; The intervention of a Central Counterparty (CCP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a trade occurs, the CCP steps in between the buyer and seller, &lt;strong&gt;acting as both the seller’s “buyer” and the buyer’s “seller.”&lt;/strong&gt; Through this legal arrangement called “novation,” the original buyer-seller relationship is no longer direct; instead, each party is responsible to the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Seller:&lt;/strong&gt; As long as shares are delivered to the CCP, they will definitely receive money from the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Buyer:&lt;/strong&gt; As long as money is delivered to the CCP, they will definitely receive shares from the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, the default risk of a single participant is absorbed by the highly creditworthy central institution – the CCP – and does not spread throughout the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;clearing--netting&#34;&gt;Clearing &amp;amp; Netting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large brokerage firm handles millions of transactions in a single day, involving both buying and selling. If each transaction were processed individually, the system would be overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; “Clearing” is performed before settlement date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the trading day (T-day), clearing agencies consolidate all buy and sell transactions for each broker, known as &lt;strong&gt;“netting” or “clearing &amp;amp; netting.”&lt;/strong&gt; For example, a brokerage firm might have bought $10 billion worth of stock and sold $9.8 billion on a given day. On settlement day, it only needs to pay a net difference of $20 million in cash, rather than engaging in a $19.8 billion exchange. Similarly, securities settlements are also processed on a net basis. This significantly improves the efficiency of the entire market and reduces liquidity requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-complete-lifecycle-of-a-stock-transaction&#34;&gt;The Complete Lifecycle of a Stock Transaction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a simple example to see the entire process from trade to settlement (using a T+2 model):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T Day (Trading Day):&lt;/strong&gt; You click “Buy” 100 shares of a company&amp;rsquo;s stock in the morning and it immediately executes. At this point, you reach an agreement with the seller, but &lt;strong&gt;ownership of the stock and funds has not yet transferred.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T Day Aftermarket ~ T+1 Day (Clearing Period):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exchange sends your trade data to the Central Clearing Corporation (CCP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP confirms the transaction information is accurate and performs a “contract swap,” becoming your counterparty for the trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP calculates the net amount of all your trades on that day through your brokerage firm, and notifies your broker how much money and securities you need to deliver by T+2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T+2 Day (Settlement Day):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the morning, your broker transfers the net settlement funds to the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP confirms receipt of the funds and instructs the Securities Custody Agency to transfer 100 shares of stock from the seller’s brokerage account to your brokerage account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your broker updates your account information internally, showing that you now hold these 100 shares of stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At this point, settlement is complete, and you officially become the legal owner of these 100 shares of stock, with the right to receive dividends, participate in voting, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the traditional concept of “settlement” in stock trading is a product of historical practice combined with modern risk control theory. It evolved from a mechanism to solve the problem of paper-based certificate circulation into a core system that uses a central counterparty and net settlement to ensure the stability and efficiency of the entire financial market. This seemingly &amp;ldquo;delayed&amp;rdquo; design is actually the key firewall protecting every investor from counterparty default risks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Over-the-Counter (OTC) Clearing and Settlement of Digital Currencies: Unveiling the Mechanisms Behind 7x24 Continuous Trading</title>

        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:03:32 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/over-the-counter-otc-clearing-and-settlement-of-digital-currencies-unveiling-the-mechanisms-behind-7x24-continuous-trading/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional stock markets with defined opening and closing times, the digital currency market has attracted the attention of global investors due to its 7x24-hour continuous trading feature. This characteristic has also raised a core question: how are digital currencies cleared and settled in a world without a “market close” concept? Does it completely overturn these concepts in traditional finance? The answer is that digital currencies not only have clearing and settlement, but the way they are implemented and their system design are key to supporting all-day trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;core-difference-from-t2-to-real-time-settlement&#34;&gt;Core Difference: From T+2 to Real-Time Settlement
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional stock trading follows a “T+N” settlement system (e.g., T+1 in China, T+2 in the US), meaning that the actual transfer of funds and securities after a trade is executed (on day T) takes one or more business days to complete. During this period, clearing agencies conduct offsetting, calculate the receivables and payables of each party, and settle differences.
Digital currencies have completely changed this model. Its core settlement and delivery can be summarized as &lt;strong&gt;“Trade-to-Clear, Clear-to-Deliver,”&lt;/strong&gt; primarily due to its underlying blockchain technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;blockchain-a-natural-real-time-full-settlement-system&#34;&gt;Blockchain: A Natural Real-Time Full Settlement System
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockchain itself can be considered a decentralized, immutable public ledger. Each transaction is recorded in a “block” and linked to the previous block through cryptographic methods, forming an irreversible “chain.” This process has the following key characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Time:&lt;/strong&gt; Once a transaction is validated by nodes on the network and packaged into a block, the transfer of assets is completed. Although confirmation times vary depending on the congestion and block generation speed of different blockchain networks (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum), ranging from seconds to several minutes, this is a qualitative leap compared to traditional finance’s “T+N.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Settlement:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike net settlement in traditional clearing systems, each transaction on the blockchain is independent and fully executed. When A transfers a bitcoin to B, it is clearly recorded in the ledger as A&amp;rsquo;s address decreasing by one and B&amp;rsquo;s address increasing by one, without any netting of multiple transactions before transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finality:&lt;/strong&gt; Once a block has been confirmed by enough subsequent blocks, this transaction is considered “final” and irreversible. This means that once settled, no one can undo or modify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, fundamentally, &lt;strong&gt;asset settlement occurs on the blockchain, automatically completed through network consensus, without the need for traditional central clearing counterparties (CCPs) or custodians.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;centralized-vs-decentralized-exchanges-different-clearing-and-settlement-pathways&#34;&gt;Centralized vs. Decentralized Exchanges: Different Clearing and Settlement Pathways
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the underlying technology is decentralized, the primary venues where users conduct digital currency transactions – exchanges – are divided into two types: centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX), which have different clearing and settlement mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;centralized-exchanges-cex-internal-clearing--on-chain-settlement&#34;&gt;Centralized Exchanges (CEX): Internal Clearing + On-Chain Settlement
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When users trade on centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, they are actually operating within the exchange’s internal centralized ledger, rather than directly on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Clearing (Ledgering):&lt;/strong&gt; When users deposit digital currencies or fiat currency into an exchange, the exchange records corresponding balances in its database for the user&amp;rsquo;s account. All buy and sell actions a user takes on the platform, such as buying BTC with USDT, essentially just represents increases and decreases in numbers within different accounts in the exchange’s database. This process is completed quickly by the exchange’s &lt;strong&gt;“matching engine,”&lt;/strong&gt; which can be considered a real-time internal clearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-Chain Settlement (Withdrawal/Deposit):&lt;/strong&gt; The actual settlement that occurs on the blockchain only happens when users &lt;strong&gt;“deposit”&lt;/strong&gt; (transfer from an external wallet into the exchange) and &lt;strong&gt;“withdraw”&lt;/strong&gt; (transfer out of the exchange to an external wallet). At this point, the exchange initiates a chain transaction to truly transfer asset ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Design Key Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Performance Matching Engine:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures rapid order matching under high concurrency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold &amp;amp; Hot Wallet Separation:&lt;/strong&gt; Most user assets are stored in offline “cold wallets” to ensure security, while a small amount of assets is kept in online “hot wallets” to meet users’ daily withdrawal needs. This is the core design for ensuring 7x24 hours of asset safety operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Ledger Database:&lt;/strong&gt; Utilizes a high-performance distributed database to ensure the accuracy and immediacy of internal transaction records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;decentralized-exchanges-dexs-on-chain-atomic-swaps&#34;&gt;Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): On-Chain Atomic Swaps
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and SushiSwap, the trading process is radically different. Users always maintain control over their own wallet private keys, and transactions are executed directly on-chain through “smart contracts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atomic Swap:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the core of how DEXs clear and settle trades. A smart contract is a program that automatically executes on a blockchain, ensuring that the exchange of assets is &amp;ldquo;atomic&amp;rdquo;—either both parties successfully exchange their assets, or neither does—preventing one party from sending assets without receiving confirmation from the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clearing and Settlement Synchronized:&lt;/strong&gt; Users authorize interactions with smart contracts through their wallets. Once a transaction is triggered and confirmed on the blockchain, clearing and settlement are instantly completed in a single step. The entire process requires no trust in any centralized intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Design Key Points:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Contracts:&lt;/strong&gt; The core logic of the exchange, including trading pairs, liquidity pools, and pricing algorithms (such as Automated Market Makers - AMMs) are all hardcoded into the smart contract, making them public and transparent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-Chain Oracles:&lt;/strong&gt; Used to securely feed external market price information onto the blockchain, providing price references for certain types of DEXs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frontend:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides a web or app interface that allows users to connect their wallets and interact with the backend smart contracts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-the-new-paradigm-for-digital-currency-clearing-and-settlement&#34;&gt;Summary: The New Paradigm for Digital Currency Clearing and Settlement
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence, digital currencies are not without the concepts of clearing and settlement; rather, they have transformed from a multi-party, time-consuming back-office process into an efficient, transparent, and even real-time automated one through blockchain technology and innovative system designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clearing Concepts Remain:&lt;/strong&gt; This is evident in CEXs as real-time matching and ledger accounting, and in DEXs, smart contracts incorporate clearing rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settlement is the Core Transformation:&lt;/strong&gt; Finality of settlement is guaranteed by blockchain consensus, enabling near real-time asset transfers – a cornerstone supporting 7x24 uninterrupted trading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Design Serves Uninterrupted Operation:&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it’s CEX cold and hot wallet architectures or DEX automated smart contracts, the primary design objective is to achieve a transaction environment without manual intervention and never closed, while ensuring security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This disruptive clearing and settlement mechanism is not only a significant distinguishing feature of digital currency markets compared to traditional finance but also provides important insights into the future evolution of financial infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
