        <title>Cursor AI Programming IDE Trial</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like another year has passed, and the biggest change at work is a significantly increased involvement of AI. Previously, switching between different development languages required developers to be familiar with various language-specific API interfaces. Now, these basic code snippets can all be generated by AI, which is a huge blessing for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chatgpt&#34;&gt;ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As early as 2023, I’ve written two simple introductory articles about it. Now it&amp;rsquo;s been 25 years – how to put this… I haven’t felt a significant improvement. It still needs to develop its own cognition, be able to reasonably break down tasks, and, of course, most importantly, identify whether AI-generated code contains bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-copilot&#34;&gt;Github Copilot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a long time ago, but I saw some information saying that Singapore deployed the server and it’s available for use in China. No longer need to maintain a VPN for extended periods. Of course, you still need to connect to a VPN when logging in, but this VPN only needs to be used during login, and then you can turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In daily use, Github Copilot is also heavily relied upon. This plugin can be directly used in VS Code and Visual Studio without switching between the two applications. Compared to ChatGPT, Github Copilot provides better support for projects, a more user-friendly interaction, and allows you to feed partial local files to it – &lt;strong&gt;“training” the AI&lt;/strong&gt; – so that the generated code is more aligned with your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cursor-ai&#34;&gt;Cursor AI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve come across a new AI programming IDE, Cursor AI. This IDE is based on Github Copilot, but it&amp;rsquo;s more intelligent and can help you create files directly.
I gave it a quick try and found it to be pretty good, however, its understanding of existing projects isn’t quite there yet. When dealing with large local project files, or major refactoring, optimization, and adjustments, developers still need to &lt;strong&gt;break down tasks&lt;/strong&gt;.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an example: Switching to Cursor’s engineering mode, inputting the following content: “Create a personal resume webpage, supporting multiple different styles switching, and remember to populate some personal information for data display.”
After several back-and-forths (&lt;strong&gt;pulling&lt;/strong&gt;), you can obtain the following webpage. Of course, this webpage is relatively simple, but it’s still quite good for beginners. ## Cursor AI
