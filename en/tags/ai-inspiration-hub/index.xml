        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s era of the global digital wave, we&amp;rsquo;ve become accustomed to instant transfers and near-instant payments. Therefore, many people are confused: why, after clicking “sell” on a stock, does my funds not immediately clear in full and become available, but instead takes one or two business days? This is precisely a crucial and historically significant concept within traditional stock trading – &lt;strong&gt;settlement&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prompt: Why does traditional stock trading require the concept of settlement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trading” and “Settlement” are two separate steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading:&lt;/strong&gt; This refers to the moment you place a buy or sell order on an exchange that is successfully matched. At this point, you and your counterparty have reached a legally binding contract committing to exchanging stocks and funds at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settlement:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the process of fulfilling the terms of the agreed-upon contract – namely, the ownership of the stock officially and irrevocably transfers from seller to buyer, while the funds are officially and irrevocably transferred from the buyer’s account to the seller’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for these two separate steps and a time lag (such as T+1, T+2 systems) stems from historical evolution and rigorous risk management in finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-roots-originating-in-the-paper-era&#34;&gt;Historical Roots: Originating in the “Paper” Era
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the widespread adoption of computer systems, stocks were tangible &lt;strong&gt;paper certificates&lt;/strong&gt;. Following a trade executed orally or through gestures at an exchange, subsequent work was incredibly laborious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical Transportation:&lt;/strong&gt; The seller’s brokerage firm needed to retrieve the corresponding stock certificate from its vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endorsement Transfer:&lt;/strong&gt; Signing and endorsing the back of the certificate to verify ownership transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Delivery:&lt;/strong&gt; These certificates and associated checks had to be delivered by personnel (couriers) throughout the city to the buyer&amp;rsquo;s brokerage firm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification &amp;amp; Reconciliation:&lt;/strong&gt; The buyer’s brokerage firm needed to verify the authenticity of the certificates and the accuracy of the transaction details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire process involved a significant amount of manual labor and physical transfer, riddled with delays and uncertainty. Consequently, an settlement cycle of several days (initially as long as T+5) was established to complete these complex processes. In the late 1960s, Wall Street was plunged into a “Paperwork Crisis” due to a surge in trading volume; a large number of trades could not be completed on time, even forcing exchanges to shorten trading hours. This directly spurred the establishment of modern electronic clearing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-core-an-unreplaceable-risk-management&#34;&gt;Modern Core: An Unreplaceable Risk Management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all transactions being electronic today, the T+N settlement system remains in place because its core function has evolved from “waiting for logistics” to &lt;strong&gt;managing the massive risks of the financial system&lt;/strong&gt;. This process is primarily carried out by a key player – &lt;strong&gt;Central Counterparty (CCP) Clearinghouses&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the Depository Trust &amp;amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation (CSDC) in the United States and China, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement system is mainly designed to mitigate the following core risks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;counterparty-risk&#34;&gt;Counterparty Risk
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the most fundamental risk. If you sell shares, how can you be 100% certain that the buyer will pay on time? Conversely, how can the buyer be 100% certain that the seller will deliver genuine shares? If either party defaults, it could trigger a chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; The intervention of a Central Counterparty (CCP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a trade occurs, the CCP steps in between the buyer and seller, &lt;strong&gt;acting as both the seller’s “buyer” and the buyer’s “seller.”&lt;/strong&gt; Through this legal arrangement called “novation,” the original buyer-seller relationship is no longer direct; instead, each party is responsible to the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Seller:&lt;/strong&gt; As long as shares are delivered to the CCP, they will definitely receive money from the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Buyer:&lt;/strong&gt; As long as money is delivered to the CCP, they will definitely receive shares from the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, the default risk of a single participant is absorbed by the highly creditworthy central institution – the CCP – and does not spread throughout the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;clearing--netting&#34;&gt;Clearing &amp;amp; Netting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large brokerage firm handles millions of transactions in a single day, involving both buying and selling. If each transaction were processed individually, the system would be overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; “Clearing” is performed before settlement date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the trading day (T-day), clearing agencies consolidate all buy and sell transactions for each broker, known as &lt;strong&gt;“netting” or “clearing &amp;amp; netting.”&lt;/strong&gt; For example, a brokerage firm might have bought $10 billion worth of stock and sold $9.8 billion on a given day. On settlement day, it only needs to pay a net difference of $20 million in cash, rather than engaging in a $19.8 billion exchange. Similarly, securities settlements are also processed on a net basis. This significantly improves the efficiency of the entire market and reduces liquidity requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-complete-lifecycle-of-a-stock-transaction&#34;&gt;The Complete Lifecycle of a Stock Transaction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a simple example to see the entire process from trade to settlement (using a T+2 model):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T Day (Trading Day):&lt;/strong&gt; You click “Buy” 100 shares of a company&amp;rsquo;s stock in the morning and it immediately executes. At this point, you reach an agreement with the seller, but &lt;strong&gt;ownership of the stock and funds has not yet transferred.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T Day Aftermarket ~ T+1 Day (Clearing Period):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exchange sends your trade data to the Central Clearing Corporation (CCP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP confirms the transaction information is accurate and performs a “contract swap,” becoming your counterparty for the trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP calculates the net amount of all your trades on that day through your brokerage firm, and notifies your broker how much money and securities you need to deliver by T+2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T+2 Day (Settlement Day):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the morning, your broker transfers the net settlement funds to the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP confirms receipt of the funds and instructs the Securities Custody Agency to transfer 100 shares of stock from the seller’s brokerage account to your brokerage account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your broker updates your account information internally, showing that you now hold these 100 shares of stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At this point, settlement is complete, and you officially become the legal owner of these 100 shares of stock, with the right to receive dividends, participate in voting, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the traditional concept of “settlement” in stock trading is a product of historical practice combined with modern risk control theory. It evolved from a mechanism to solve the problem of paper-based certificate circulation into a core system that uses a central counterparty and net settlement to ensure the stability and efficiency of the entire financial market. This seemingly &amp;ldquo;delayed&amp;rdquo; design is actually the key firewall protecting every investor from counterparty default risks.&lt;/p&gt;
