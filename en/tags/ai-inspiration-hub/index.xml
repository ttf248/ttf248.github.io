&lt;li&gt;Analysis of NVIDIA’s “Play” Worth a Billion Investment
The global capital market is witnessing an unprecedented wave of centralization in 2025, centered around artificial intelligence (AI). This narrative not only reshapes the tech industry&amp;rsquo;s landscape but also exacerbates wealth inequality on Wall Street. The former &amp;ldquo;Magnificent Seven&amp;rdquo; no longer adequately describes today’s dynamics; the market is now dominated by a handful of super winners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will delve into three key questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What proportion of the entire stock market do the top ten U.S. companies represent in terms of market capitalization?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does AI constitute a bubble? Is NVIDIA’s (NVIDIA) multi-billion dollar “reciprocal investment” with OpenAI justified?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s recent investment moves, and what is the underlying strategic logic behind them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write article: What proportion of the entire stock market do the top ten U.S. companies represent? Does AI constitute a bubble? Are NVIDIA’s investments and reciprocal investment with OpenAI justified? Compile NVIDIA’s recent investment actions and analyze their rationale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;market-concentration-top-10-giants-dominate-40-of-us-stock-market-capitalization&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Concentration: Top 10 Giants Dominate 40% of US Stock Market Capitalization&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the latest data from October to November 2025, the concentration in the US stock market (represented by the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index) has reached a remarkable level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The top 10 US companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 currently account for approximately 40% of the index’s total market capitalization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure represents an even greater increase than the roughly 30% held by the “Big Seven” a year or two ago. As of early November 2025, the top 10 US companies were approximately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NVIDIA:&lt;/strong&gt; Market Cap Approaching $5 Trillion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple:&lt;/strong&gt; Market Cap Approximately $4 Trillion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft:&lt;/strong&gt; Market Cap Approximately $3.85 Trillion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alphabet (Google):&lt;/strong&gt; Market Cap Approximately $3.4 Trillion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon:&lt;/strong&gt; Market Cap Approximately $2.6 Trillion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broadcom:&lt;/strong&gt; Market Cap Approximately $1.75 Trillion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta Platforms:&lt;/strong&gt; Market Cap Approximately $1.63 Trillion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tesla:&lt;/strong&gt; Market Cap Approximately $1.52 Trillion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berkshire Hathaway:&lt;/strong&gt; Market Cap Approximately $1.03 Trillion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JPMorgan Chase:&lt;/strong&gt; Market Cap Approximately $0.85 Trillion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This high concentration means that the stock price performance of a few key companies can determine the entire market’s direction. And the core fuel driving this “super-concentration” is, without question – &lt;strong&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-bubble-and-the-100-billion-closed-loop-nvidias-mutual-investment-with-openai&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Bubble and the $100 Billion “Closed Loop”: NVIDIA’s “Mutual Investment” with OpenAI&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “mutual investment” between NVIDIA and OpenAI, which you mentioned, became a global shock event by September 2025. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t traditional VC investment, but a strategic partnership valued at &lt;strong&gt;$100 billion&lt;/strong&gt;, representing a significant shift in the AI landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The “Closed Loop” Structure of the Partnership:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NVIDIA Investment:&lt;/strong&gt; NVIDIA announced it would invest up to &lt;strong&gt;$100 billion&lt;/strong&gt; in OpenAI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI Procurement:&lt;/strong&gt; OpenAI will utilize this funding (and other financing) to purchase NVIDIA’s chip systems, committing to deploy at least &lt;strong&gt;10 ExaWatts (EW)&lt;/strong&gt; of computing power – involving millions of GPUs – and adopting NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s next-generation “Vera Rubin” platform starting in 2026.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Is This Model Reasonable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a highly controversial topic, with market opinions divided between “revolution” and “bubble.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspective 1: Reasonable - It’s the Inevitable Choice of the ‘AI Revolution’ (The Revolution Case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For OpenAI (the Buyer):&lt;/strong&gt; The path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) requires near-unlimited computing power.  In today&amp;rsquo;s market, NVIDIA’s GPUs are the most powerful and have the most mature ecosystems – they are the “shovels.” Locking down supply of top-tier chips for several years is the only way to ensure its continued leadership in the AI arms race.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For NVIDIA (the Seller):&lt;/strong&gt; OpenAI is its largest and most important customer. By investing $100 billion and deeply binding itself with OpenAI, NVIDIA effectively secures a massive order for its next-generation platform (Vera Rubin), guaranteeing future revenue and absolute market dominance over several years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspective 2: Unreasonable - It’s a Classic ‘AI Bubble’ Feature (The Bubble Case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Closed Loop Financing”:&lt;/strong&gt; Critics argue this is a “left hand, right hand” capital game. NVIDIA gives money to OpenAI, which then uses that money to order from NVIDIA. This creates massive revenue and growth on paper, but significantly amplifies valuations and bubbles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant Financial Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Reports indicate NVIDIA was even discussing providing OpenAI with &lt;strong&gt;loan guarantees&lt;/strong&gt; to build data centers.  This means if OpenAI’s business model fails in the future (e.g., AGI doesn&amp;rsquo;t materialize or operating costs are too high leading to bankruptcy), NVIDIA faces risks of tens of billions – or even hundreds of billions – in debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raises Antitrust Concerns:&lt;/strong&gt; This transaction is viewed by regulators and competitors as “anti-competitive.” Analysts worry that, as a market “arms dealer,” NVIDIA will use its investment to deeply bind itself with the largest “mercenary” OpenAI, incentivizing it to refuse selling chips to OpenAI’s competitors (like Anthropic, Google, etc.), or offer worse terms, thereby stifling innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; This model is NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s high-risk, high-reward strategic &amp;ldquo;play&amp;rdquo; to ensure its AI dominance. It’s both a catalyst for massive AI development and potentially the footnote on the largest bubble in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nvidias-investment-empire-a-calculated-demand-creation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s Investment &amp;ldquo;Empire&amp;rdquo;: A Calculated Demand Creation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia has long been more than just a “chip vendor.” Through its venture capital arm (NVIDIA GPU Ventures), it is actively transforming into the “banker” and “ecosystem builder” for the entire AI gold rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-nvidias-recent-key-investment-actions&#34;&gt;📈 NVIDIA’s Recent Key Investment Actions
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s investment pace has accelerated dramatically in 2024-2025. As of October 2025, NVIDIA has invested in &lt;strong&gt;59 AI startups&lt;/strong&gt; this year, surpassing the 55 invested in throughout 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its investment portfolio covers almost every vertical within AI, with a focus on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI (Foundation Models)&lt;/strong&gt;: In September 2025, it reached a strategic investment and procurement agreement valued at &lt;strong&gt;$100 billion&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poolside (AI Programming)&lt;/strong&gt;: Revealed to lead an investment of up to &lt;strong&gt;$100 million&lt;/strong&gt;, supporting the development of AI software engineers in October 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nokia (6G/Telecoms)&lt;/strong&gt;: Announced a strategic partnership and invested &lt;strong&gt;$100 million&lt;/strong&gt; jointly developing AI-RAN (Radio Access Network) to capture the 6G market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure AI (Humanoid Robots)&lt;/strong&gt;: Investing in this star robotics company, positioning itself for the future of “Embodied Intelligence.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perplexity AI (AI Search)&lt;/strong&gt;: Investing in this OpenAI competitor, securing a foothold in the next-generation information gateway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wayve (Autonomous Driving)&lt;/strong&gt;: Investing in the UK’s autonomous driving company to ensure its dominance in automotive chips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-investment-logic-analysis-why-is-it-reasonable&#34;&gt;🤔 Investment Logic Analysis: Why is it Reasonable?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia CEO Huang Renjun’s strategy is very clear. The core logic of its investments isn&amp;rsquo;t purely financial returns, but rather to serve its core chip business, which can be summarized into three key objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Core Objective: “Invest, Then Buy My Chips”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Nvidia’s most direct investment logic. Nvidia injects capital into startups (like Poolside), who in turn use this money to purchase Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s expensive GB300 or next-generation GPUs. This not only locks in customers but also artificially creates demand, forming a “mutually beneficial” business ecosystem between Nvidia and its invested companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Strategic Objective: Building a &amp;ldquo;CUDA Ecosystem Moat&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s true moat is its CUDA software platform. By scattering money across all levels of the AI ecosystem (robotics, biopharmaceuticals, autonomous driving, AI programming), Nvidia ensures that these most promising future companies develop from day one based on the CUDA platform. This prevents competitors (like AMD, Intel) from shaking Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s position even if their hardware keeps up in terms of performance – they simply can’t disrupt Nvidia’s dominance in the software ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Expansion Objective: Securing New Tracks for Chips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia needs to constantly find the next “AI wave” to support its $500 billion valuation. Its investment in Nokia (6G) is to push its AI chips into the massive telecommunications infrastructure market; its investment in Figure AI (robotics) is a bet on &amp;ldquo;embodied intelligence&amp;rdquo; becoming the next major consumer of computing power after cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-trickery-under-monopoly&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: “Trickery” Under Monopoly&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented concentration in the US stock market reflects the productivity leap brought about by the AI revolution, but it also carries enormous risks of bubbles. The billion-dollar “closed loop” partnership between Nvidia and OpenAI is a microcosm of this high-stakes gamble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s investment strategy is a meticulously planned “trickery”: It leverages its strong capital strength to &lt;strong&gt;not only become a “weapons supplier” in the AI era, but also to transform into a “banker” and “rule maker,”&lt;/strong&gt; ensuring that all paths to the future are paved with Nvidia chips. This strategy is highly rational and efficient from a business perspective, but it also exposes it to significant antitrust pressure and potential financial risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For investors, understanding this game driven by AI, led by giants, and strengthened by capital closed loops is key to comprehending the current market.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Breaking Through the Cocoon: Examining Huawei and Xiaomi’s High-End Rivalry Following Xiaomi 17&#39;s Renaming</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/breaking-through-the-cocoon-examining-huawei-and-xiaomis-high-end-rivalry-following-xiaomi-17s-renaming/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 10:15:36 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/breaking-through-the-cocoon-examining-huawei-and-xiaomis-high-end-rivalry-following-xiaomi-17s-renaming/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In an era of information explosion, we all, to varying degrees, live within our own “information bubbles.” Algorithms recommend content that interests us, and over time, our horizons are subtly narrowed. This phenomenon seems equally applicable to the smartphone market – brand loyalty, media bias, and community voices are all weaving consumers into one bubble after another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Xiaomi’s recent move, like a stone thrown into a still lake, has created ripples, attempting to break down this invisible barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Information bubbles, Xiaomi phone change 16 to 17 is not a temporary action, so much inventory, Huawei&amp;rsquo;s high-end path? Xiaomi’s high-end path ultimately relies on product strength to speak&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;xiaomis-concealed-strategy-skipping-16-confronting-17&#34;&gt;Xiaomi’s “Concealed Strategy”: Skipping 16, Confronting 17
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xiaomi has resolutely renamed its upcoming flagship, set to be released as the “Xiaomi 17,” from the initially planned “Xiaomi 16,” revealing its intent – a direct challenge to Apple’s iPhone 17. This was not a spontaneous whim; for a company of this scale, any flagship product&amp;rsquo;s naming, preparation, and marketing is a massive undertaking that requires careful planning months, or even years in advance, involving millions of packaging materials, promotional items, and channel communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This renaming represents Xiaomi’s meticulously planned “concealed strategy,” a bold gamble on a brand-level strategic move. It sends a clear signal: Xiaomi is no longer content with the “value for money” label; instead, it intends to enter Apple and Huawei’s long-dominated high-end market territory with a “head-on confrontation” attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By aligning itself digitally with the iPhone, Xiaomi aims to break consumers&amp;rsquo; ingrained thinking, placing its products in the same conversational context as top-tier flagships. This is Xiaomi’s bold and confident declaration of its product capabilities, and represents its most aggressive and decisive attempt to penetrate the high-end market after five years of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;huaweis-high-end-path-rebuilding-glory-in-adversity&#34;&gt;Huawei’s High-End Path: Rebuilding Glory in Adversity
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the topic of the high-end market is mentioned, Huawei is unavoidable. After experiencing the widely known external pressures, Huawei&amp;rsquo;s path to the high-end has been exceptionally difficult yet remarkably steadfast. Leveraging continued deep cultivation in imaging technology and breakthroughs in self-developed chips, Huawei’s Pura and Mate series remain benchmark products in the high-end market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei’s strategy is more like a “cultivation of inner strength.” It builds powerful technological barriers to entry, such as the XMAGE imaging brand, Kunlun Glass, HarmonyOS operating system, to create core differentiators for its products. Even when facing enormous challenges with supply chains, Huawei continues to enhance product quality, fostering extremely high user loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Huawei’s market share in China&amp;rsquo;s high-end market is steadily recovering – a story of victory based on resilience and product power. Its high-end path is one achieved through technological innovation and brand resilience, step by step, overcoming adversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-battle-of-the-titans-is-ultimately-a-matter-of-product-power&#34;&gt;The Battle of the Titans is Ultimately a Matter of “Product Power”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s “One-Step Completion,” or Huawei’s “Steady and Solid,” their paths to the premium market differ, but ultimately, the landing point is always “product power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-end users are willing to pay a higher price not just for a brand logo, but also for comprehensive recognition of the technology, experience, design, and services behind the product. After the noise of marketing, what truly retains users is genuine experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s focus our attention on the products themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imaging Capability:&lt;/strong&gt; The Huawei Pura 70 Ultra continues to lead in the mobile photography field thanks to its unique retractable camera and powerful XMAGE imaging system. Meanwhile, Xiaomi 17 Series also features a camera system co-developed with Leica, along with new sensors and algorithms, aiming to challenge top industry standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; The Xiaomi 17 was the first to feature Qualcomm’s latest flagship Snapdragon chip, boasting natural advantages in performance release. Huawei, on the other hand, relies on iterative development of its self-designed chips, showcasing unique competitiveness in power consumption and system synergy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen &amp;amp; Design:&lt;/strong&gt; Both sides are putting in their best efforts regarding screen quality, material, and design language. Kunlun Glass’s robust durability, combined with Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s continued investment in display technology, have become distinctive labels for their respective products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecosystem Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; HarmonyOS’s distributed capabilities enable Huawei to create a seamless ecosystem experience, while Xiaomi’s HyperOS is also working hard to build its own intelligent closed-loop ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing strategies can break down consumers&amp;rsquo; “information silos,” allowing more people to see a brand’s ambition and transformation. But to truly let consumers “walk out of the house” willingly switching brands, it ultimately relies on solid product power to provide an irresistible choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xiaomi turned the digital “16” into “17,” which is not just a change in name but also a leap in its brand mentality and market strategy. Huawei, meanwhile, has rebuilt the foundation of its premium brand amidst storms. This battle between the two giants in China’s high-end smartphone market is only beginning its most exciting chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For consumers, this is undoubtedly good news. When all the giants lower their postures and refocus their attention on products themselves, we will ultimately see a more diverse and experience-driven era. And who can emerge victorious in this battle of the titans – time, and the fingertips of every user, will give the final answer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Understanding spin-offs and splits in the US stock market can be challenging.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-spin-offs-and-splits-in-the-us-stock-market-can-be-challenging/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 22:09:31 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/understanding-spin-offs-and-splits-in-the-us-stock-market-can-be-challenging/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Prompt: As a Chinese person, when seeing English financial news and information about actions of US listed companies, why are mergers and acquisitions written like this: NAOV reverse stock split: 1 for 10? Is this a unique English grammar that doesn&amp;rsquo;t conform to Chinese grammatical habits? Based on this, please explain the meaning of the stock split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello! This is a very good question, and many investors who speak Chinese as their mother tongue will have the same confusion when first encountering English financial news. This is indeed a specific expression habit in English in the field of finance, which differs greatly from the order of Chinese grammar.
I will explain the meaning of the stock split to you in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-a-1-for-10-reverse-stock-split-written-as-1-for-10&#34;&gt;Why is a 1 for 10 Reverse Stock Split Written as “1 for 10”?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down this expression: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;A for B&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within this structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; represents the &lt;strong&gt;new thing you will receive&lt;/strong&gt; (the result).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; represents the &lt;strong&gt;old thing you are giving up&lt;/strong&gt; (the cost/exchange).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The word “for” here means &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;in exchange for&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;“1 for 10 reverse stock split”&lt;/strong&gt; translates directly as: &lt;strong&gt;“1 new share for 10 old shares”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, your &lt;strong&gt;every 10 existing shares will be consolidated into 1 new share&lt;/strong&gt;. This is precisely what the Chinese terms “10 combine with 1” or “10 shares merge into 1 share” mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;grammatical-habit-comparison&#34;&gt;Grammatical Habit Comparison
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English Convention (Result for Reason/Cost):&lt;/strong&gt;  Places “the result obtained” at the front and “the cost paid” at the back. For example, &lt;code&gt;You get 1 new share for your 10 old shares.&lt;/code&gt; Headlines are often shortened to &lt;code&gt;1 for 10&lt;/code&gt; for brevity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Convention (Reason/Cost -&amp;gt; Result):&lt;/strong&gt; Tends to follow a chronological or logical order, stating “the original state” first, followed by “the resulting outcome.” For example, “(originally) 10 shares merged into (now) 1 share.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this isn’t a universal English grammar; it&amp;rsquo;s a very common convention and abbreviation used when expressing &amp;ldquo;exchange ratio&amp;rdquo; in business and finance.
&lt;strong&gt;Illustrative Example (NAOV 1 for 10 Reverse Stock Split):&lt;/strong&gt;
Assume you hold 1000 shares of the NAOV company before a reverse stock split, with a share price of $0.5 per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Asset Value:&lt;/strong&gt; 1000 shares * $0.5/share = $500 USD
After the reverse split (1 for 10):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Shares Held:&lt;/strong&gt; 1000 shares / 10 = 100 shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theoretical Share Price:&lt;/strong&gt; $0.5/share * 10 = $5 per share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Asset Value:&lt;/strong&gt; 100 shares * $5/share = $500 USD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; The primary purpose of the reverse stock split is to increase the price per share, which reduces the number of shares you hold, but (assuming no market fluctuations) your total asset value remains unchanged. Companies typically conduct reverse stock splits to meet exchange minimum price requirements (such as Nasdaq’s requirement for a share price to maintain above $1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-split-explanation&#34;&gt;Stock Split Explanation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you understand consolidation, a stock split is easily understood. A stock split is the opposite of consolidation.
English is typically written like this: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;2 for 1 stock split&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;3 for 1 stock split&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
Using the &lt;code&gt;A for B&lt;/code&gt; structure we’ve learned above to interpret it:
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;2 for 1 stock split&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; means: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;You will receive 2 new shares in exchange for your 1 old share.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;
This is exactly what the Chinese phrase “&lt;strong&gt;1拆2&lt;/strong&gt;” or “&lt;strong&gt;1股拆为2股&lt;/strong&gt;” means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example (A Company’s 2 for 1 Stock Split):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that before the split, you hold 100 shares of a company with a stock price of $200 per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Asset Value:&lt;/strong&gt; 100 shares * $200/share = $20,000
After the split (2 for 1):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Shares Held:&lt;/strong&gt; 100 shares * 2 = 200 shares&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price Per Share (Theoretically)&lt;/strong&gt;: $200/share / 2 = $100 per share&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Asset Value:&lt;/strong&gt; 200 shares * $100/share = $20,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; The purpose of a stock split is to lower the price per share, making it more attractive to small investors and increasing liquidity. It will increase your number of shares held, but equally so, your total asset value remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hong Kong Stock Exchange Brokerage Fee Liberalization and Market Competition</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-stock-exchange-brokerage-fee-liberalization-and-market-competition/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 21:47:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-stock-exchange-brokerage-fee-liberalization-and-market-competition/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The practice of “the same contract code, for transactions in the same direction, commission is only charged once” is commonly referred to as &lt;strong&gt;“Commission Aggregation / Combined Commission”&lt;/strong&gt; within the securities industry. This is not a hard-and-fast regulation by the Hong Kong Exchange or regulatory bodies, but rather a business convention formed through market competition and brokers’ efforts to optimize customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding HK stocks, when the same contract code is used for transactions in the same direction, only one commission is charged – does this have any historical business background?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-historical-turning-points-cancellation-of-the-minimum-commission-rule-in-2003&#34;&gt;Key Historical Turning Points: Cancellation of the Minimum Commission Rule in 2003
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the most important background to understand this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-Reform (Before April 1, 2003):&lt;/strong&gt; The Hong Kong stock market operated under a &lt;strong&gt;Minimum Commission Rule&lt;/strong&gt;. At the time, brokers were required to charge clients a commission of no less than 0.25% of the transaction value. During this period, all brokerage commissions were essentially locked at the same level, and competition primarily focused on research capabilities, client relationships, and service quality; price wars were virtually non-existent. Therefore, there was no incentive to consolidate commissions for clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Reform (After April 1, 2003):&lt;/strong&gt; The Hong Kong Exchange officially &lt;strong&gt;abolished the Minimum Commission Rule&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing brokers and clients to freely negotiate commission rates. This reform instantly ignited competition in the Hong Kong securities industry, particularly commission price wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-product-of-fierce-market-competition&#34;&gt;A Product of Fierce Market Competition
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the removal of minimum commission fees, securities firms (particularly emerging internet brokers) have adopted various innovative pricing strategies to attract customers. “Consolidated Commission” is one such highly attractive initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attracting Active Traders:&lt;/strong&gt; For high-frequency traders or investors who prefer to buy and sell the same stock in batches (such as to avoid large single orders impacting market prices), per-trade fees can significantly increase transaction costs. The “Consolidated Commission” policy perfectly addresses this pain point, allowing investors to flexibly establish or liquidate positions within a day without worrying about multiple commission charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing Customer Transaction Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the most direct objective. By consolidating calculations, customer actual commission expenses are reduced, making the broker’s platform more competitive in terms of cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing Customer Experience and Loyalty:&lt;/strong&gt; This customer-friendly policy greatly enhances the user experience, making customers feel that the broker is looking out for their interests, thereby strengthening customer loyalty and retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;business-logic-and-brokerage-interests&#34;&gt;Business Logic and Brokerage Interests
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although superficially, brokerage revenue appears to be declining, from a holistic business logic perspective, it’s a win-win situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Margin, High Volume:&lt;/strong&gt; Reducing the effective cost of each transaction can stimulate customers to trade more frequently, thereby increasing overall trading volume. While brokers “give away” commissions on individual trades, they can compensate by increasing total transaction volume and earning other fees, such as platform usage fees and financing/margin interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Share Acquisition:&lt;/strong&gt; In a fiercely competitive market, particularly for new internet brokerages, low commission rates and promotional policies are the most effective means of quickly acquiring users and capturing market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-points-to-note&#34;&gt;Key Points to Note
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not All Brokers Offer It:&lt;/strong&gt; While “merged commission” has become mainstream, it’s still a broker&amp;rsquo;s business decision and not a mandatory regulation. Some traditional brokers or banks may still charge per trade for their securities services, so investors need to carefully review the broker’s fee schedule when choosing a broker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only Applies to “Commission”:&lt;/strong&gt; Be sure to note that the calculated merged amount only includes the “commission” charged by the broker. Any “fixed fees” collected by the government or exchanges are calculated per trade and cannot be merged. These include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stamp Duty (印花税):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.1% (Paid by both buyer and seller, rounded up to the nearest dollar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SFC Transaction Levy (交易征费):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.0027% (Collected by the Securities and Futures Commission)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HKEX Trading Fee (交易费):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.00565% (Collected by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRC Transaction Levy (会财局交易征费):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.00015% (Collected by the Financial Regulatory Authority)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary, the “merged commission” policy of Hong Kong brokers is rooted in the abolition of the Minimum Commission System in 2003. It was a significant business strategy adopted by brokers in an environment of market liberalization and intense competition – to reduce customer costs, enhance service experience, attract and retain customers – representing a microcosm of Hong Kong’s financial market transitioning from traditional to modern, from high barriers to accessibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>- Significant differences in trading and settlement between stocks and digital currencies</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/significant-differences-in-trading-and-settlement-between-stocks-and-digital-currencies/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 18:28:54 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/significant-differences-in-trading-and-settlement-between-stocks-and-digital-currencies/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the significant differences between traditional stocks and digital currencies in terms of trading and settlement, we need to deeply grasp the core “components” and “rules” that make up each ecosystem. We can view them as two entirely different games: one a rigorous, multi-party collaborative “professional league,” and the other a code-as-law, open-to-all “open world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the previous two questions, are there any foundational knowledge points we could explore to further expand this understanding? Let’s also compile some resources for you to learn more about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-1-the-foundation-of-traditional-stock-markets--a-chain-of-trust-composed-of-professional-institutions&#34;&gt;Part 1: The Foundation of Traditional Stock Markets – A Chain of Trust Composed of Professional Institutions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of traditional financial markets is &lt;strong&gt;“trust”&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;“intermediaries.”&lt;/strong&gt; The entire system is designed as a multi-layered structure, with each stage played by regulated professional institutions to ensure market stability and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-players&#34;&gt;The Players
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You (Investor):&lt;/strong&gt; The starting and ending point of the transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broker:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;sole gateway&lt;/strong&gt; for you to enter the market. You cannot directly go to the Shanghai Stock Exchange or New York Stock Exchange to buy stocks; you must use a broker holding a license to execute your trading instructions and hold your funds and securities (as a nominal holder).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Exchange:&lt;/strong&gt; The market’s &lt;strong&gt;“trading floor”&lt;/strong&gt;. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ. Its primary function is to provide a fair, open venue where buy and sell offers meet (matching), thereby discovering prices. &lt;strong&gt;The exchange only handles order matching; it does not handle subsequent fund and stock transfers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central Counterparty Clearing Corporation (CCP):&lt;/strong&gt; The market’s &lt;strong&gt;“risk guarantor”&lt;/strong&gt;. This is at the core of risk management. After a trade is executed, the CCP intervenes between all buyers and sellers, becoming “all buyers to all sellers” and “all sellers to all buyers.”  This way, any party&amp;rsquo;s default risk is borne by the CCP, preventing risks from spreading through the market like dominoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Central Securities Depository (CSD):&lt;/strong&gt; The market’s &lt;strong&gt;“ultimate vault” and “master registry”&lt;/strong&gt;. Examples include DTCC in the US and China’s ZSDEC. This is a crucial institution that electronically centralizes and custodians the vast majority of securities in the entire market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;core-concepts-the-paperless-and-non-moveable-nature-of-securities&#34;&gt;Core Concepts: The “Paperless” and “Non-Moveable” Nature of Securities
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dematerialization:&lt;/strong&gt; The stocks you buy today are not physical paper certificates, but a series of electronic records within a CSD (Central Securities Depository) database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immobilization:&lt;/strong&gt; This is key to understanding settlement. When settlement occurs, there isn&amp;rsquo;t actually an “electronic stock file” being sent from one broker’s server to another. Instead, all the stocks are “fixed” stored in this central vault – the CSD. The settlement process simply involves the CSD making a transfer of shares from the seller broker’s omnibus account to the buyer broker’s omnibus account on its master ledger. Your broker then updates its own internal customer records to reflect that you now hold more shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multi-tiered, clearly defined structure, while introducing time delays (T+N), has established a robust and mature risk isolation and management mechanism – the cornerstone of modern financial markets&amp;rsquo; stable operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-two-the-foundation-of-the-digital-currency-market--a-trustless-system-built-on-code-and-cryptography&#34;&gt;Part Two: The Foundation of the Digital Currency Market – A “Trustless” System Built on Code and Cryptography
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital currencies aim to reduce or eliminate reliance on traditional intermediaries, with its foundation being &lt;strong&gt;“cryptographic proof”&lt;/strong&gt; rather than &lt;strong&gt;“institutional trust.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;core-technology-the-technology&#34;&gt;Core Technology (The Technology)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blockchain / DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology):&lt;/strong&gt; Think of it as a &lt;strong&gt;distributed, globally maintained ledger that cannot be altered, held by countless individuals.&lt;/strong&gt; Every transaction is publicly recorded and verifiable by anyone, but no single person or institution can control it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public &amp;amp; Private Keys:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the &lt;strong&gt;sole proof of ownership for your assets in the digital currency world.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Key:&lt;/strong&gt; Equivalent to your &lt;strong&gt;bank account number&lt;/strong&gt;. You can safely share this with anyone to receive digital currencies. Your wallet address is generated from the public key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Key:&lt;/strong&gt; Equivalent to your &lt;strong&gt;bank password + U盾 + signature combination&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s the only key to access assets associated with that address. &lt;strong&gt;Whoever holds the private key has absolute control over the assets in that address.&lt;/strong&gt; This is also the origin of the encryption world&amp;rsquo;s golden rule: “Not your keys, not your coins” (If you don’t hold the private key, you don’t own the cryptocurrency).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crypto Wallet:&lt;/strong&gt; It &lt;strong&gt;doesn’t store any “coins”&lt;/strong&gt; (coins always reside on the blockchain). The wallet’s essence is a &lt;strong&gt;tool for managing your private key&lt;/strong&gt; and helping you sign transactions with your private key to interact with the blockchain network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Contract:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a piece of code that automatically executes on the blockchain. Its logic is “If…then…” (IF-THEN). For example, a decentralized exchange’s smart contract could be: “If I receive 1 ETH from User A, then automatically send 2000 USDC to User A&amp;rsquo;s address.” The entire process is automatically enforced by code with no human intervention and without requiring trust in anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;core-rules-consensus-mechanism&#34;&gt;Core Rules: Consensus Mechanism
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do thousands of nodes in a network reach agreement on which transactions are valid when there is no central server? That’s the role of a consensus mechanism. The two most common types are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof of Work (PoW):&lt;/strong&gt; As exemplified by Bitcoin. It involves “miners” performing massive hash calculations (like solving an extremely difficult math problem) to compete for the right to record transactions. The first miner to solve the puzzle can package the latest transactions into a block and broadcast it to the entire network, which other nodes verify and accept. This method is highly energy-intensive but provides very high security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof of Stake (PoS):&lt;/strong&gt; Adopted by Ethereum after its upgrade. It no longer relies on a competition of computing power; instead, “validators” who hold and “stake” tokens are selected to create and validate blocks. The more tokens staked, the greater the probability of being chosen to record transactions. If they act maliciously, their staked tokens will be forfeited. This method is more energy-efficient and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-and-comparison&#34;&gt;Summary and Comparison
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand, we can use a table to summarize the fundamental differences between them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| &lt;strong&gt;Asset Type&lt;/strong&gt; | Electronic Ledger (Dematerialized) in CSD | Native Digital Token on Blockchain |&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-and-comparison-6&#34;&gt;Summary and Comparison
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the above additions, you can see that traditional finance relies on establishing a complex “trust chain” to manage risk and complete settlements; while digital currencies attempt to build a system without intermediaries using technological means (cryptography and distributed networks) to achieve self-validation. These two fundamentally different underlying logics determine the stark differences in all aspects of transactions, clearing, and settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why the concept of “settlement” is necessary in traditional stock trading?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/why-the-concept-of-settlement-is-necessary-in-traditional-stock-trading/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:18:46 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/why-the-concept-of-settlement-is-necessary-in-traditional-stock-trading/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s era of the global digital wave, we&amp;rsquo;ve become accustomed to instant transfers and near-instant payments. Therefore, many people are confused: why, after clicking “sell” on a stock, does my funds not immediately clear in full and become available, but instead takes one or two business days? This is precisely a crucial and historically significant concept within traditional stock trading – &lt;strong&gt;settlement&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;prompt: Why does traditional stock trading require the concept of settlement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the English translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trading” and “Settlement” are two separate steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading:&lt;/strong&gt; This refers to the moment you place a buy or sell order on an exchange that is successfully matched. At this point, you and your counterparty have reached a legally binding contract committing to exchanging stocks and funds at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settlement:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the process of fulfilling the terms of the agreed-upon contract – namely, the ownership of the stock officially and irrevocably transfers from seller to buyer, while the funds are officially and irrevocably transferred from the buyer’s account to the seller’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for these two separate steps and a time lag (such as T+1, T+2 systems) stems from historical evolution and rigorous risk management in finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-roots-originating-in-the-paper-era&#34;&gt;Historical Roots: Originating in the “Paper” Era
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the widespread adoption of computer systems, stocks were tangible &lt;strong&gt;paper certificates&lt;/strong&gt;. Following a trade executed orally or through gestures at an exchange, subsequent work was incredibly laborious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical Transportation:&lt;/strong&gt; The seller’s brokerage firm needed to retrieve the corresponding stock certificate from its vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endorsement Transfer:&lt;/strong&gt; Signing and endorsing the back of the certificate to verify ownership transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Delivery:&lt;/strong&gt; These certificates and associated checks had to be delivered by personnel (couriers) throughout the city to the buyer&amp;rsquo;s brokerage firm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification &amp;amp; Reconciliation:&lt;/strong&gt; The buyer’s brokerage firm needed to verify the authenticity of the certificates and the accuracy of the transaction details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire process involved a significant amount of manual labor and physical transfer, riddled with delays and uncertainty. Consequently, an settlement cycle of several days (initially as long as T+5) was established to complete these complex processes. In the late 1960s, Wall Street was plunged into a “Paperwork Crisis” due to a surge in trading volume; a large number of trades could not be completed on time, even forcing exchanges to shorten trading hours. This directly spurred the establishment of modern electronic clearing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-core-an-unreplaceable-risk-management&#34;&gt;Modern Core: An Unreplaceable Risk Management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all transactions being electronic today, the T+N settlement system remains in place because its core function has evolved from “waiting for logistics” to &lt;strong&gt;managing the massive risks of the financial system&lt;/strong&gt;. This process is primarily carried out by a key player – &lt;strong&gt;Central Counterparty (CCP) Clearinghouses&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the Depository Trust &amp;amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation (CSDC) in the United States and China, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement system is mainly designed to mitigate the following core risks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;counterparty-risk&#34;&gt;Counterparty Risk
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the most fundamental risk. If you sell shares, how can you be 100% certain that the buyer will pay on time? Conversely, how can the buyer be 100% certain that the seller will deliver genuine shares? If either party defaults, it could trigger a chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; The intervention of a Central Counterparty (CCP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a trade occurs, the CCP steps in between the buyer and seller, &lt;strong&gt;acting as both the seller’s “buyer” and the buyer’s “seller.”&lt;/strong&gt; Through this legal arrangement called “novation,” the original buyer-seller relationship is no longer direct; instead, each party is responsible to the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Seller:&lt;/strong&gt; As long as shares are delivered to the CCP, they will definitely receive money from the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Buyer:&lt;/strong&gt; As long as money is delivered to the CCP, they will definitely receive shares from the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, the default risk of a single participant is absorbed by the highly creditworthy central institution – the CCP – and does not spread throughout the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;clearing--netting&#34;&gt;Clearing &amp;amp; Netting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large brokerage firm handles millions of transactions in a single day, involving both buying and selling. If each transaction were processed individually, the system would be overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution:&lt;/strong&gt; “Clearing” is performed before settlement date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the trading day (T-day), clearing agencies consolidate all buy and sell transactions for each broker, known as &lt;strong&gt;“netting” or “clearing &amp;amp; netting.”&lt;/strong&gt; For example, a brokerage firm might have bought $10 billion worth of stock and sold $9.8 billion on a given day. On settlement day, it only needs to pay a net difference of $20 million in cash, rather than engaging in a $19.8 billion exchange. Similarly, securities settlements are also processed on a net basis. This significantly improves the efficiency of the entire market and reduces liquidity requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-complete-lifecycle-of-a-stock-transaction&#34;&gt;The Complete Lifecycle of a Stock Transaction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a simple example to see the entire process from trade to settlement (using a T+2 model):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T Day (Trading Day):&lt;/strong&gt; You click “Buy” 100 shares of a company&amp;rsquo;s stock in the morning and it immediately executes. At this point, you reach an agreement with the seller, but &lt;strong&gt;ownership of the stock and funds has not yet transferred.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T Day Aftermarket ~ T+1 Day (Clearing Period):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exchange sends your trade data to the Central Clearing Corporation (CCP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP confirms the transaction information is accurate and performs a “contract swap,” becoming your counterparty for the trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP calculates the net amount of all your trades on that day through your brokerage firm, and notifies your broker how much money and securities you need to deliver by T+2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T+2 Day (Settlement Day):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the morning, your broker transfers the net settlement funds to the CCP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCP confirms receipt of the funds and instructs the Securities Custody Agency to transfer 100 shares of stock from the seller’s brokerage account to your brokerage account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your broker updates your account information internally, showing that you now hold these 100 shares of stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At this point, settlement is complete, and you officially become the legal owner of these 100 shares of stock, with the right to receive dividends, participate in voting, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the traditional concept of “settlement” in stock trading is a product of historical practice combined with modern risk control theory. It evolved from a mechanism to solve the problem of paper-based certificate circulation into a core system that uses a central counterparty and net settlement to ensure the stability and efficiency of the entire financial market. This seemingly &amp;ldquo;delayed&amp;rdquo; design is actually the key firewall protecting every investor from counterparty default risks.&lt;/p&gt;
