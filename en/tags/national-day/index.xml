        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the eve of China’s National Day in 2024, the stock market experienced a remarkable surge, attracting considerable attention. However, following the holiday, the market unexpectedly turned to a dramatic plunge. This “polarization” of the stock market – a rollercoaster ride between soaring highs and plummeting lows – not only subjected investors to a thrilling yet nerve-wracking experience, but also prompted deep reflection on policy, economics, and market fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Insert relevant news snippets and data visualizations here - this section would be populated with actual content for a blog post.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-national-day-stock-surge-a-policy-driven-frenzy&#34;&gt;Pre-National Day Stock Surge: A Policy-Driven Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the five trading days leading up to National Day, China’s stock market surged from a slump into “boiling mode.” On September 30th, the A-share market saw a broad rally with all indices hitting historic highs. The Shanghai Composite Index rose by 8.06%, the Shenzhen Component Index increased by 10.67%, and the ChiNext Board Index soared by 15.36%, with the northbound CSI 50 Index setting a record for the largest single-day rise, jumping 22.84%. Market sentiment was extremely exuberant, with daily trading volumes across the Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing Stock Exchanges reaching RMB 2611.5 billion, up RMB 1155.9 billion compared to the previous day. More than 5300 stocks on the main board rallied collectively, creating a “sea of red.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driving force behind this rally was the concentrated release of a series of unexpectedly positive policies by the government and the resulting changes in market expectations. On September 24th, the People’s Bank of China announced a cut in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) and interest rates, reducing the interest rates on existing mortgages, and unified the minimum down payment ratios for mortgages. At the Central Political Bureau meeting on September 26th, it was emphasized that efforts should be made to intensify counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policy adjustments, strive to boost capital markets, and actively guide medium and long-term funds into investment. On September 30th, a series of ten real estate support policies were released. These policy measures conveyed the government’s firm determination to stabilize the market and promote growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-national-day-stock-market-plunge-calm-and-adjustment-after-the-frenzy&#34;&gt;Post-National Day Stock Market Plunge: Calm and Adjustment After the Frenzy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, market sentiment plummeted sharply after the National Day holiday. On October 8th, the A-share market opened strongly with nearly a limit-up rise, but following a significant high opening, the market experienced violent fluctuations before closing down. Since then, the market’s center of gravity has continuously shifted downwards, and as of October 16th, the Shanghai Composite Index rose and fell by more than 15%, cumulatively falling by over 470 points. From October 8th to 10th, core A-share indices all declined, with the Shenzhen Component Index down 6.21%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this plunge are multifaceted, on one hand, digesting the accumulated risks from a rapid rise in the previous period, and on the other hand, related to adjustments in market expectations regarding policy. Some investors believe that the short-term effects of policies have become apparent, but the long-term effects still need to be observed. Furthermore, fluctuations in global markets also impacted A-shares. On October 9th, the Hang Seng Index plummeted by 9.41%, and A50 futures fell by 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reflection-and-outlook-on-the-market&#34;&gt;Reflection and Outlook on the Market
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dramatic volatility in the stock market around National Day highlighted a deep reflection among investors regarding policy, economics, and market fundamentals. On one hand, the short-term stimulus effects of policies were significant, but their long-term impact remains to be observed. On the other hand, the rapid rise and fall of the market served as a reminder for investors to maintain rationality and avoid emotional investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, whether A-shares can usher in a genuine “long bull” trend depends on whether policy can effectively transmit to the real economy and ultimately drive substantive improvements in economic fundamentals. Investors should closely monitor the specific implementation of policies and changes in economic data to rationally adjust their investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp rallies and crashes in the stock market around National Day were a game between policy and the market, and also a test of investors’ mindset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
