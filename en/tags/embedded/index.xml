        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mentioning embedded systems, what comes to mind are still the 51 microcontrollers and Freescale from my school lab days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LPA3399Pro is a visual host developed on the Rockchip RK3399Pro platform, designed for portable computing hosts requiring extensive vision processing scenarios. It features an integrated NPU computing unit with 3.0 TOPS of computing power and supports various algorithm models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RV1109 is Realtek&amp;rsquo;s AI-specific machine vision SoC branch, featuring an integrated independent NPU. RV1109 can provide 1 TOPS of computing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;system-on-chip&#34;&gt;System on Chip
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoC is an abbreviation for &amp;ldquo;System on a Chip,&amp;rdquo; meaning &amp;ldquo;on-chip system.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a technology that integrates multiple electronic systems onto a single chip. This technology can significantly reduce the size and weight of electronic products while improving performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoCs (System on a Chip) and CPUs (Central Processing Units) are both important components of computer systems, but there are some differences between them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPU is the core processor in a computer system, responsible for executing program instructions. It typically includes only basic components such as an arithmetic unit, control unit, and registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoCs integrate multiple electronic systems onto a single chip, and in addition to including a CPU, they can also incorporate other components such as memory, graphics processors, and input/output interfaces. This significantly reduces the size and weight of electronic products while improving performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, a CPU is a component of an SoC, while an SoC is a more complex and highly integrated electronic system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;microcontroller-unit&#34;&gt;Microcontroller Unit
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoC (System on a Chip) and MCU (Microcontroller Unit) are technologies that integrate multiple electronic systems onto a single chip, but there are some differences between them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An MCU is a microcontroller, typically including basic components such as a CPU, memory, and input/output interfaces. It is commonly used to control other electronic devices, such as home appliances and automotive electronics systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SoCs integrate more electronic systems onto a single chip, including basic components like MCUs and other elements such as graphics processors and wireless communication modules. This significantly reduces the size and weight of electronic products while improving performance and reducing power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, an MCU is a simple microcontroller, while a SoC is a more complex and highly integrated electronic system&lt;/p&gt;</description>
