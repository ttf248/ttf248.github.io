        <title>Broad-based index investing: Broker ETFs, Hang Seng Tech Index</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to buy a solid blue-chip stock and just leave it, but I never managed to do it. When it fell, I didn&amp;rsquo;t add to my position, and when it rose, I sold it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding suitable blue-chip stocks is troublesome; it&amp;rsquo;s better to choose a broad index and buy an ETF. The current plan is: securities ETF, Hang Seng Tech Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trading strategy has a professional term: left-side dip buying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;broker-etfs&#34;&gt;Broker ETFs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securities ETF refers to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that primarily invest in listed securities broker stocks within the Chinese stock market. Securities ETFs typically track a specific securities brokerage index, such as the China Securities Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought it before, but chased after the price and ended up losing money, so I cleared out my position. In China&amp;rsquo;s market, every bull market sees brokerages rise; how much they rise depends on investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-technology-index&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Technology Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index is a stock index launched by the Hong Kong Exchange, designed to reflect the overall performance of the technology sector in the Hong Kong market. It includes major tech companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, covering areas such as internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 20, 2025, the top ten constituents and their weightings in the Hang Seng Tech Index (code: 800700) are as follows (data compiled from multiple authoritative sources):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;舜宇集团 (舜宇光学科技集团有限公司) (01810.HK): Approximately 8.82%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China Resources Pharmaceutical Holdings (00700.HK): Approximately 8.14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Country Garden (09988.HK): Approximately 7.72%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;京东集团-SW&lt;/strong&gt; (09618.HK): Approximately 7.60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;舜宇光学科技集团有限公司 (Sunvision Technology Co., Ltd.) (03690.HK): Approximately 7.35%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(01024.HK): Approximately 6.10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bold (02015.HK): Approximately 6.09%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;中芯国际&lt;/strong&gt; (00981.HK): Approximately 5.70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(09999.HK): Approximately 4.59%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approximately 4.48%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 66.6% (some sources indicate a combined share of the top ten between 68%-69%, with differences due to varying statistical time points)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-notes&#34;&gt;Key Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index caps the weighting of any single stock at 8%. For example, SMIC&amp;rsquo;s weighting previously exceeded 8% before adjustments in March 2025 but was subsequently reduced to comply with this limit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On May 16, 2025, Hang Seng Index Company announced that BYD (01211.HK) will be added to the index and China Literature (00772.HK) removed. The adjustment will take effect on June 6. Therefore, as of today (May 20), the constituent stocks are based on the pre-adjustment list; BYD is not yet included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The top ten components are dominated by internet technology companies (such as Tencent, Alibaba, and Meituan), with significant weighting in new energy vehicles (Xiaomi, Li Auto) and semiconductors (SMIC), reflecting the index&amp;rsquo;s coverage of technology and the new economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differences in data from various sources are primarily due to differing statistical time points. For example, data from March 2025 shows the top ten combined share at approximately 69.4%, while data from May 14th indicates 68.82%, reflecting the dynamic impact of market fluctuations on weighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-to-position-on-a-pullback-on-the-left-side&#34;&gt;Add to position on a pullback (on the left side)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;left-side topping up&amp;rdquo; strategy is an investment approach where investors buy in batches during a sustained stock price decline, anticipating the price is nearing a bottom to reduce holding costs and profit from future price increases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method falls under the category of &amp;ldquo;left-side trading,&amp;rdquo; meaning taking a counter-trend position before the market has clearly bottomed out. In practice, investors typically employ a &amp;ldquo;pyramid&amp;rdquo; accumulation strategy, gradually increasing buy quantities as the price declines to lower their average holding cost. For example, initially buying a certain number of shares; if the price continues to fall, they increase their buying volume at a lower price, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying in batches during a downturn can lower average cost basis and set the stage for future profits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing positions before the market reverses can yield greater returns when the trend improves if your judgment is correct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the stock price continues to fall, it may lead to greater losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adequate financial support is required for continuous restocking, and there&amp;rsquo;s a risk of funds being locked up long-term&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively speaking, &amp;ldquo;right-side trading&amp;rdquo; involves buying after a clear market trend and price recovery signal, offering lower risk but potentially missing early gains. Therefore, investors should choose a strategy that aligns with their risk tolerance, financial situation, and market judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory&#34;&gt;Valuation theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuation theory is a core concept in finance, aiming to assess the intrinsic value of assets or companies and provide a basis for investment decisions. Through valuation, investors can determine whether the current market price of an asset is reasonable and formulate corresponding investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method is based on the expected future cash flows of an asset, which are then discounted to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The DCF method emphasizes intrinsic value and is suitable for evaluating companies with stable and predictable earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method assesses a company&amp;rsquo;s relative value by comparing its valuation metrics (e.g., P/E, P/B, P/S) to those of comparable companies in the same industry. Relative valuation is easy to implement and widely used for quick assessments and peer comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method determines a company&amp;rsquo;s value by assessing its net asset value, which is the difference between total assets and liabilities. The asset-based approach is suitable for asset-dominant companies such as real estate firms or capital-intensive businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through valuation, investors can identify undervalued or overvalued assets and formulate buy-or-sell strategies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In M&amp;amp;A transactions, valuation is key to determining the transaction price and influencing its success&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company needs to fairly value its assets and liabilities to ensure the accuracy and transparency of financial statements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that valuation results are influenced by various factors, including market conditions, company operations, and macroeconomic indicators. Therefore, a comprehensive consideration of all factors, combined with qualitative and quantitative analysis, is necessary to achieve more accurate assessments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
