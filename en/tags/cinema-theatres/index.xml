        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the Spring Festival, a family of seven or eight wanted to see a movie. We planned to buy tickets on Taopihao and Maoyan, but saw the price was 60 yuan. Luckily, we had a cinema recharge card that required purchasing tickets at the front desk in person. Thinking to ask about any discounts, we were surprised to find the same showing only cost 35 yuan there – quite a difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hidden-platform-fees&#34;&gt;Hidden platform fees
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While online ticketing platforms offer convenience, their service fees are significant. They invest in user-friendly features like seat selection and purchase history tracking, which require funding. These costs are passed on to the customer through service fees, resulting in higher ticket prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cinema-differentiation-strategies&#34;&gt;Cinema Differentiation Strategies
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand for movie tickets during the Spring Festival is surging, and theaters are using tiered pricing to maximize profits. Online platforms have high traffic, so many people buy tickets in advance online, resulting in higher prices for those tickets. Meanwhile, walk-in customers buying at the front desk receive lower prices to attract them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pricing-logic-behind-profit-sharing&#34;&gt;The pricing logic behind profit sharing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online platforms and cinemas cooperate through revenue-sharing models that affect ticket prices. To ensure profitability, platforms take a percentage of the box office, leading to higher ticket costs. Cinema counters, without intermediary fees, offer more affordable tickets due to lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips-for-buying-tickets&#34;&gt;Tips for Buying Tickets
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t just look at online platforms when buying tickets. Try calling the cinema directly or visiting the front desk – you might find a surprise. If you’re a frequent moviegoer, consider getting a membership card to enjoy member discounts and save money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
