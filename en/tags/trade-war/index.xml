        <title>Trade war suddenly put on hold</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of tariffs in the 2025 trade war presented a cycle of &amp;ldquo;escalation — retaliation — consultation,&amp;rdquo; as the US-China competition shifted from tariff confrontation to rules-based competition. While short-term easing alleviated market pressure, long-term uncertainty remains, and it is necessary to monitor the continued impact on the global economy from WTO rulings, supply chain adjustments, and geopolitical changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can&amp;rsquo;t earn money beyond their own understanding. The stock market crash triggered by the trade war this year, even now that losses have been largely recovered, has buried countless small investors along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the timeline for tariffs in trade wars in 2025&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a breakdown of the 2025 trade war tariff timeline, incorporating key events from China, the US, and other countries to illustrate the evolving dynamics of tariff policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-april-2025-comprehensive-tariff-escalation-and-retaliation&#34;&gt;I. April 2025: Comprehensive Tariff Escalation and Retaliation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US tariffs on China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 2, the Trump administration signed Executive Order 14257, announcing a 34% tariff on goods imported from China, covering products from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 8th, the United States further increased tariffs on Chinese goods from 34% to 84% and signed Executive Orders 14259 and 14266, imposing additional tariffs on more products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 10th: The White House revised an executive order, raising the total tariffs on China to 145%, and increasing tariffs on small packages (such as raising the tax rate on goods under $800 from 90% to 120%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s countermeasures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 4th, China announced tariffs of 34% on all goods originating from the United States, covering areas such as agricultural products, automobiles, and energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 10th, China will raise retaliatory tariffs from 34% to 84%, matching the escalation by the US side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 12th: China canceled 91% of the tariffs imposed on US goods (corresponding to the portion cancelled by the US side) and suspended the implementation of the remaining 24% tariffs for 90 days, retaining 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariff disputes among other countries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US-Canada trade war: The United States has imposed a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum products from Canada. Canada retaliated by imposing tariffs on US$298 billion worth of American goods and filed a complaint with the WTO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The EU is imposing tariffs of up to 25% on US goods, while Japan has expressed concerns about tariffs on US automobiles, calling the trade war &amp;ldquo;harmful to both sides.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-may-2025-geneva-talks-and-tariff-easing&#34;&gt;II. May 2025: Geneva Talks and Tariff Easing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China-U.S. High-Level Economic and Trade Talks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From May 10th to 11th, China and the United States held 16 hours of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, reaching the &amp;ldquo;China-US Geneva Trade Talks Joint Statement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May 12th: Both sides announced suspension of some tariffs
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United States has suspended 24% of tariffs on China (for 90 days), retained 10%, and canceled additional taxes scheduled for April 8th and 9th&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China will suspend 24% of retaliatory tariffs, retain 10%, and remove non-tariff measures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both sides agreed to establish a consultation mechanism and regularly hold trade consultations in China, the United States, or a third country, focusing on tariff reduction and rule-making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Impact and Policy Adjustments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US domestic pressure: High tariffs are causing small and medium-sized enterprises to go out of business (such as Amazon sellers being forced to close due to soaring tariffs), and inflation expectations are heating up (core PCE is expected to rise to 3.3%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China&amp;rsquo;s rare earth countermeasures: China has tightened controls on rare earth exports, cracked down on smuggling, and impacted the US military industry and new energy supply chain, forcing them to seek waivers for tariffs on rare earths and other key minerals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-other-key-events-and-long-term-impacts&#34;&gt;III. Other Key Events and Long-Term Impacts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WTO and multilateral response&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canada and China have separately filed appeals with the WTO over US steel and aluminum tariffs and &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; alleging violations of the non-discrimination principle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned that US tariffs could cause a 1% contraction in global trade volume in 2025 and exacerbate the difficulties faced by developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exemption List and Industry Impact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US exemption goods: A 37-page list covering strategic materials such as rare earths, graphite, and medical CT tubes exposes supply chain vulnerabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US tariffs on imported cars of 25% have led to a global forecast of a 2% decline in auto production, with a 9% reduction in North America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political and strategic game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trump administration attempted to reshape the international trade order through &amp;ldquo;reciprocal tariffs,&amp;rdquo; but was criticized as unilateral bullying, triggering a backlash from allies (such as the EU and Japan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China is responding to protectionism by expanding market access (such as the China International Import Expo, and zero-tariff commitments) and attracting cooperation from developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-of-timeline&#34;&gt;Summary of Timeline
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Event&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 2, 2025, the United States will impose a 34% tariff on China, covering goods from Hong Kong and Macau&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 8th, the United States will raise tariffs on China to 84% and introduce new tax administrative orders&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 10, China retaliated with a tariff of 34%, later raised to 84%; the US revised its tariffs to 145%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On April 12, the United States exempted certain goods (such as technology products), and China canceled 91% of its retaliatory tariffs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;US, China and Japan talks in Geneva reached a joint statement agreeing to suspend 24% tariffs (for 90 days)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;On May 12, both sides announced a suspension of tariffs and a negotiation mechanism, easing trade tensions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;five-trends-and-challenges&#34;&gt;Five: Trends and Challenges
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-term easing and long-term competition: The suspension of tariffs between China and the US sends a positive signal, but structural contradictions (such as high technology and energy) remain, and midterm elections may affect policy continuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global supply chain restructuring: Companies are accelerating adjustments to their supply chains, with Mexico and Southeast Asia benefiting from “nearshoring,” but rising costs may dampen the recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The predicament of multilateral mechanisms: The WTO dispute settlement mechanism is constrained, regional trade agreements (such as the UK-US agreement) have become alternative options, but this exacerbates fragmentation&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>US-China trade war</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-china-trade-war/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a tangent, the differences between socialism with Chinese characteristics and capitalism. From the older generation, I’ve heard that to get rich, you must first build roads. Infrastructure construction in China is funded by the state; in a capitalist society, these would be contracted out. In remote areas, there are no profits to be made, so companies wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be willing to take on the work. Talking too much will stray from the current article’s theme. Ordinary people may feel that the trade war has little impact on their lives, but in reality, China’s high-end manufacturing has always been relatively weak. In the IT industry I work in, memory, hard drives, CPUs, and graphics cards – the core components of assembling a computer – all come from foreign factories. The cost of these parts accounts for 50% of the total price of the machine. High-end manufacturing is imperative. The collision between China and the United States is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reference-materials&#34;&gt;Reference materials
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Sino-American trade war that began in 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made in China 2025&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sino-American trade war, also known as the China–United States trade war, or more briefly as the Sino-US trade dispute, Sino-US trade friction, Sino-US trade quarrel, or US-China trade war, is a trade war between the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China and the United States of America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade dispute originated when U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on March 22, 2018, claiming that &amp;ldquo;China steals American intellectual property and business secrets,&amp;rdquo; and directed the United States Trade Representative to impose tariffs on goods imported from China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, involving an estimated total value of $60 billion. On July 6, 2018, the U.S. imposed a 25% additional tariff on Chinese exports worth $340 billion. The Ministry of Commerce of China responded with retaliatory measures on the same day, imposing a 25% additional tariff on U.S. exports to China worth $340 billion, including soybeans, one of the most exported products from the United States to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China had previously reached a consensus in May 2018 to suspend the trade war and issued a joint statement seeking resolution. However, the Office of the United States Trade Representative subsequently announced on June 16th a first batch of tariffs targeting $500 billion worth of Chinese goods entering the US, raising the original 10% tariff rate to 25%. In response, the State Council Tariff Commission of China retaliated with equivalent measures, and the Ministry of Commerce also resumed anti-dumping investigations on multiple US products. On July 6th, the Trump administration formally imposed a 25% tariff on $340 billion worth of Chinese goods in the first batch of tariffs, marking the formal implementation of Trump&amp;rsquo;s China tariff policy (the remaining $160 billion was subsequently subject to a 25% tariff on August 23rd). The Ministry of Commerce later stated in a statement that &amp;ldquo;The United States violated WTO rules and launched the largest trade war in economic history.&amp;rdquo; Customs authorities said that China’s countermeasures had been implemented immediately after the US tariffs took effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 1, at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump reached a consensus to conduct 90-day negotiations and suspend new trade measures during the negotiation period. After the deadline of March 1, 2019, the United States announced significant progress and extended the suspension of new trade measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs of 25% on Chinese goods entering the United States valued at approximately $200 billion, bringing the total subject to tariffs to $250 billion. The measure took effect on June 1 for Chinese products arriving at U.S. ports. On May 13, the State Council Tariff Commission of China announced that it would raise tariffs by 5% to 25% on certain imports from the United States valued at $60 billion, effective June 1. On June 1, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced a postponement of the U.S. tariff increase to June 15, while the State Council Tariff Commission of China stated that China’s retaliatory tariffs would take effect as scheduled on June 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 29, the leaders of the two countries, Xi Jinping and Donald Trump, held talks at the G20 Osaka Summit, agreeing to restart trade consultations and for the United States not to impose new tariffs on Chinese products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 1, due to the Trump administration&amp;rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the progress of China’s purchases of U.S. agricultural products, Trump announced on Twitter that starting September 1, 2019, a 10% tariff would be imposed on all remaining Chinese goods exported to the United States valued at $300 billion. On August 5, the exchange rate of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar fell below the 7 threshold. On the same day, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it was designating China as a currency manipulator. Subsequently, the Chinese government announced a suspension of purchases of U.S. agricultural products and on August 24 announced tariffs of 10% or 5% on approximately $750 billion worth of U.S. goods, and resumed tariffs on U.S. automobiles and their parts; in response, the United States increased the tariff rate previously imposed on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods to 15%, and raised the current 25% tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30%, but this was later put on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 16, 2020, China and the United States signed the Phase One trade agreement&lt;/p&gt;</description>
