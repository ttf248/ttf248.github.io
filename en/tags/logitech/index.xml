        <title>Win11 Logitech G431 Headset Driver Installation</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Picking up where we left off, I discovered that GitHub had an update, which was a little exciting. The customer service team said the issue with the driver not loading properly was resolved. However, after going through all of this – reinstalling and uninstalling – it still wasn’t working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing to contact customer service to inquire about a resolution, I was informed that an engineer could provide remote assistance. However, the engineer’s working hours coincided exactly with my own, leaving me with no option but to abandon the effort. Reviewing the documentation from the previous troubleshooting issue, I decided to attempt a manual driver installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obtaining-driver-installation-packages&#34;&gt;Obtaining Driver Installation Packages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logitech does not provide separate driver installation packages for devices. How can I obtain the driver files?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with the system image package left over from the previous system reinstallation, we can reinstall the system once in a local virtual machine, and then deploy a clean copy of Ghub in the pure system, inserting the headset device into the virtual machine to find the driver path and copy it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevant paths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\ProgramData\LGHUB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\logi_audio.inf_amd64_010b035044e24be4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;device-manager&#34;&gt;Device Manager
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus is on how to find the second path – let’s first briefly outline how to manually manage driver files in a Windows 11 system. This content &lt;strong&gt;is identified using the method of controlling variables by repeatedly plugging and unplugging devices, analyzing device information within Device Manager inside a virtual machine, and identifying three drivers that need to be handled for headphones.&lt;/strong&gt; Two of these drivers are system-provided, while one is provided by Logitech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/20240605073331.png&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;47&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;114px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second driver shown in the image, it’s provided by Logitech.  Let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the current driver program for the device and then search all driver paths within the virtual machine. Of course, you first need to find files starting with “logi,” then compare the files, which will help you pinpoint the driver folder. Copying the entire folder gives you the driver installation package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/20240605073933.png&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;146&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;352px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-the-driver&#34;&gt;Installing the Driver
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the device manager interface, click: Update driver, then click: Browse my computer to find drivers, and you’ll arrive at the following interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/20240605074130.png&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;138&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;332px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when you open it, you&amp;rsquo;ll only see one driver – the standard USB driver. Select &amp;ldquo;Install from disk&amp;rdquo; and the path is the folder we copied earlier. After installation, you’ll be able to add Logitech-specific drivers in the dropdown list. Switch the device driver to the newly installed driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;human-anatomy-device-driven&#34;&gt;Human Anatomy Device-Driven
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These driver files are provided by the system. You only need to check if there is an exclamation mark preceding the device driver name. If there is, enter the Driver Selection interface, randomly switch to a different type of driver, and then revert it back to restore normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;completed&#34;&gt;Completed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microphone volume on the headphones has been restored to normal, and the familiar in-ear functionality has returned.

        <title>Logitech Headset Driver Installation Failed</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you completely don&amp;rsquo;t understand these things, contacting official customer service first will also avoid wasting several hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the C drive on my desktop computer, which I use for development, had run out of space. I specially took out a 256GB semi-retired solid state hard drive and used it as the C drive. Unfortunately, I kept messing around with it. Since moving to Shanghai, I’ve been busy with various things, and last week I finally took some time to reinstall the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system reinstallation went smoothly, and installing everyday software and deploying development environments didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter any problems. A few days later, I planned to relax and play a few games when I realized that the drivers for my mouse and headphones hadn’t been installed. Both devices are from Logitech, so I downloaded the GHUB software, which can automatically identify hardware and install drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an unexpected problem occurred. The mouse driver installed successfully, but the headphone driver kept displaying “Loading…”. I suspected that the latest version of Windows 11 might be incompatible with Logitech’s drivers, causing the installation to fail. So, I started searching for information and trying to manually install the drivers, but the problem remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s briefly explain what the functions of these two devices’ drivers are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mouse driver is mainly used to adjust mouse movement speed and other functions. I rarely use macro functions; I just need to restore previously remembered parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The headphone driver primarily focuses on the headset function, which is very useful during team voice chats, allowing me to hear my own voice. Although there’s a similar listening function in the system&amp;rsquo;s microphone settings, it doesn’t perform as well as the driver implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite repeatedly trying, the headphone driver always failed to load properly. Today, I finally thought of contacting customer support to inquire about the situation and see if there were any solutions. The customer service representative told me that their servers had recently experienced an issue, causing driver downloads to be abnormal. They are currently working on resolving the problem, asking me not to panic, and promising a solution with the next update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the headphone driver issue hasn’t been resolved yet, at least I now know the cause, and I hope the problem can be solved as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
