        <title>Win11 Logitech G431 Headset Driver Installation</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Picking up where we left off, I discovered that GitHub had an update, which was a little exciting. The customer service team said the issue with the driver not loading properly was resolved. However, after going through all of this – reinstalling and uninstalling – it still wasn’t working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing to contact customer service to inquire about a resolution, I was informed that an engineer could provide remote assistance. However, the engineer’s working hours coincided exactly with my own, leaving me with no option but to abandon the effort. Reviewing the documentation from the previous troubleshooting issue, I decided to attempt a manual driver installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obtaining-driver-installation-packages&#34;&gt;Obtaining Driver Installation Packages
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logitech does not provide separate driver installation packages for devices. How can I obtain the driver files?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with the system image package left over from the previous system reinstallation, we can reinstall the system once in a local virtual machine, and then deploy a clean copy of Ghub in the pure system, inserting the headset device into the virtual machine to find the driver path and copy it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevant paths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\ProgramData\LGHUB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\logi_audio.inf_amd64_010b035044e24be4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;device-manager&#34;&gt;Device Manager
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus is on how to find the second path – let’s first briefly outline how to manually manage driver files in a Windows 11 system. This content &lt;strong&gt;is identified using the method of controlling variables by repeatedly plugging and unplugging devices, analyzing device information within Device Manager inside a virtual machine, and identifying three drivers that need to be handled for headphones.&lt;/strong&gt; Two of these drivers are system-provided, while one is provided by Logitech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/20240605073331.png&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;47&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;114px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second driver shown in the image, it’s provided by Logitech.  Let&amp;rsquo;s analyze the current driver program for the device and then search all driver paths within the virtual machine. Of course, you first need to find files starting with “logi,” and then compare the files – this will allow you to pinpoint the location of the driver folder, copy the entire folder, and you’ll have the driver installation package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-the-driver&#34;&gt;Installing the Driver
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the device manager interface, click: Update driver, then click: Browse my computer to find drivers, and you’ll arrive at the following interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ttf248.life/p/win11-logitech-g431-headphone-driver-installation/20240605074130.png&#34;
	width=&#34;528&#34;
	height=&#34;381&#34;

		alt=&#34;Driver Installation&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;138&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;332px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when you open it, you&amp;rsquo;ll only see one driver – the standard USB driver. Select &amp;ldquo;Install from disk&amp;rdquo; and the path is the folder we copied earlier. After installation, you’ll be able to add Logitech-specific drivers in the dropdown list. Switch the device driver to the newly installed driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;human-anatomy-device-driven&#34;&gt;Human Anatomy Device-Driven
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These driver files are provided by the system. You only need to check if there is an exclamation mark preceding the device driver name. If there is, enter the Driver Selection interface, randomly switch to a different type of driver, and then revert it back to restore normal operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;completed&#34;&gt;Completed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microphone volume on the headphones has been restored to normal, and the familiar in-ear functionality has returned.

        <title>Logitech Headset Driver Installation Failed</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you completely don&amp;rsquo;t understand these things, contacting official customer service first will also avoid wasting several hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the C drive of my desktop computer used for development was running out of space, so I took out a 256GB semi-retired solid state hard drive to use as the C drive. Unfortunately, I kept messing around with it. Since moving to Shanghai, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with various things, and finally last week I took some time to reinstall the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system reinstallation went smoothly, and installing daily software and deploying development environments didn’t encounter any problems. A few days later, I planned to relax and play a few games when I realized that the drivers for my mouse and headphones hadn&amp;rsquo;t been installed. Both devices are Logitech products, so I downloaded the GHUB software, which can automatically identify hardware and install drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an unexpected event occurred. The mouse driver installed successfully, but the headphone driver kept displaying &amp;ldquo;Loading&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I suspect it may be incompatibility between the latest version of Windows 11 and Logitech’s drivers, causing the installation to fail. Therefore, I began searching for information and attempting manual driver installations, but the problem remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me briefly explain the roles of these two drivers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mouse driver primarily focuses on adjusting mouse movement speed and other functions. I rarely use macros; I simply restore previously remembered parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The headphone driver mainly handles the microphone functionality (earphone mic), which is very useful during team voice calls, allowing me to hear my own voice. Although there’s a similar listening function in the system&amp;rsquo;s microphone settings, it doesn’t perform as well as the driver implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-text-1&#34;&gt;Main Text
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite my repeated attempts, the headset driver consistently failed to load properly. Today, I finally thought of reaching out to customer service to inquire about the situation and see if there were any solutions. Customer service informed me that their servers had recently experienced an issue, leading to abnormal driver downloads. They are currently addressing this problem and asked me not to worry; the issue should be resolved after the next update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the headset driver issue hasn’t been resolved yet, at least I now know the cause, and I hope the problem can be fixed as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
