        <title>Win11 Logitech G431 Headphone Driver Installation</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Picking up where we left off, I came back to find that Ghub had been updated, which made me a little happy. The customer service said they fixed the issue of not being able to load problem drivers properly, but after messing around with it for a while – reinstalling and uninstalling – it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t work normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I continued to contact customer service for a solution, but was told that an engineer could provide remote assistance. However, the engineer&amp;rsquo;s working hours were exactly the same as mine, so I had no choice but to give up. I reviewed the materials from the previous troubleshooting and prepared to try installing the driver manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-the-driver-installation-package&#34;&gt;Get the driver installation package
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can I obtain the driver files since Logitech doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide a separate driver installation package for their devices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the system image installation package left over from the last system reinstallation, we can reinstall the system in a local virtual machine. In the cleanest system, deploy Ghub separately, insert the headset device into the virtual machine, find the driver path, and copy it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related paths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\ProgramData\LGHUB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\logi_audio.inf_amd64_010b035044e24be4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;device-manager&#34;&gt;Device Manager
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is how to find the second path. Let&amp;rsquo;s first briefly review how to manually manage driver files in Win11 systems. This content was identified using the control variable method, by constantly plugging and unplugging devices and analyzing device information in Device Manager within a virtual machine. We identified that three drivers need to be handled for the headset. Two of these drivers are built-in system drivers, and only one is provided by Logitech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driver Manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second driver in the image is provided by Logitech. We analyze the current device drivers, and search through all driver paths within the virtual machine. Of course, you first need to find files starting with &amp;ldquo;logi,&amp;rdquo; then compare the files. You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to locate the driver file. Copy the entire folder, and you’ve got the driver installation package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driver installation package&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-driver&#34;&gt;Install driver
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still in the Device Manager interface, click: Update Driver, click: Browse My Computer for Drivers, and you will enter the following interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driver Installation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when you open it, you can only see a drive – that&amp;rsquo;s the standard USB drive. Choose &amp;ldquo;Install from disk,&amp;rdquo; and the path is the folder we copied earlier. After installation, a Logitech-specific driver will appear in the drop-down list. Switch the device driver to the newly installed one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disk Installation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anatomy-equipment-drivers&#34;&gt;Anatomy equipment drivers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drivers for this device are provided by the system. You only need to check if there&amp;rsquo;s an exclamation mark in front of the device driver; if there is, go into the driver selection interface and switch to a different type of driver, then change it back to restore normal functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;completed&#34;&gt;Completed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headset microphone volume has returned to normal, and the familiar ear monitoring function is back as well&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Logitech headset driver installation failed</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;rsquo;t understand these things at all, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have wasted several hours troubleshooting; you would have contacted official customer service right away&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the C drive on my home desktop computer used for development ran out of space. I specially allocated a 256GB SSD that was partially retired for exclusive use by the C drive, but it&amp;rsquo;s been frequently messed with. Since moving to Shanghai, I’ve been busy with various matters, and finally last week I found time to reinstall the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system reinstall went smoothly, and there were no issues with installing everyday software or deploying the development environment. A few days later, I planned to relax and play a few games, when it occurred to me that the drivers for my mouse and headphones hadn&amp;rsquo;t been installed yet. Both devices are Logitech, so I downloaded GHUB software, which automatically recognizes hardware and installs drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an unexpected issue occurred. The mouse driver installed smoothly, but the headset driver kept displaying &amp;ldquo;Loading.&amp;rdquo; I suspect that incompatibility between the latest version of Windows 11 and Logitech&amp;rsquo;s drivers caused the installation to fail. So, I started searching for information and tried to manually install the driver, but the problem remained unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple explanation of what each of these devices’ drivers do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mouse driver is mainly used to adjust functions such as mouse movement speed. I rarely use macro functions, only needing to restore previously saved parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The driver for the headphones is mainly used for the monitor function, which is very useful during team voice communication as it allows me to hear my own voice. Although there&amp;rsquo;s a similar listening feature in the system’s microphone settings, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work as well as the driver implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite repeated attempts, the drivers for my headphones consistently fail to load. Today, I finally thought to contact customer service to inquire about the situation and see if there was a solution. Customer service told me that their servers have recently been experiencing issues, causing abnormal driver downloads. They are working on this problem and asked me not to worry, saying the issue should be resolved after the next update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the issue with the headphone drivers hasn&amp;rsquo;t been resolved yet, at least we know the cause, and I hope the problem can be fixed as soon as possible&lt;/p&gt;
