        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the Spring Festival, DeepSeek briefly became a hot topic, garnering widespread attention on social media in just a few days. This sudden surge in popularity was not only surprising but also triggered a chain reaction in the market. At the same time, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock experienced a sharp decline, raising concerns about its prospects among many investors. Some institutions conducted large-scale short selling during this period, suggesting everything pointed towards a &amp;ldquo;well-planned&amp;rdquo; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deepseeks-rapid-rise-to-prominence-quickly-becoming-the-focus-of-attention&#34;&gt;DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s rapid rise to prominence: quickly becoming the focus of attention
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is an AI-based tool focused on optimizing deep learning models, particularly in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and image generation. In the days leading up to the Spring Festival, this project suddenly garnered significant attention from a large number of investors and technical professionals. The performance of its team and the technological achievements demonstrated have sparked strong interest among many people. Discussions about DeepSeek dominate all topics in the tech circle, whether on developer communities or social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s sudden surge in popularity is not accidental. After analysis, many people suspect that some institutions may be involved behind the scenes. Especially after its rise, Nvidia’s stock price experienced a noticeable decline, and there are clearly factors driving this change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nvidia-stock-plummets-the-force-behind-the-short-selling-operation&#34;&gt;Nvidia stock plummets: The force behind the short-selling operation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), has long been a key hardware provider for many large language models and AI computing. With the rapid development of the AI market, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock has consistently performed strongly and even become a favored investment target for many investors. However, with the rise of DeepSeek and the market’s high attention to its technology, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock experienced a sharp decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind this phenomenon, there may be involved the short-selling strategies of institutional investors. In recent years, with the popularization of AI technology, Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock price has been highly driven up, and many investors began to believe that its stock price was overhyped. Especially after DeepSeek’s explosive success, some institutions may have gained substantial profits by shorting Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock. By seizing precise market timing and predicting the influence of DeepSeek, these institutions successfully profited from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;exploring-large-model-thinking-chains-from-results-to-process&#34;&gt;Exploring Large Model Thinking Chains: From &amp;ldquo;Results&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Process&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In traditional AI applications, many practitioners and investors focus more on the &amp;ldquo;results&amp;rdquo; of AI models—such as generated images, text, and other direct outputs. However, in discussions related to DeepSeek, an increasing number of people are realizing that the thinking chain hidden behind large models is the core content that deserves more attention. In the past, we could only see the results of model output, but now, we need to understand the underlying logic, algorithms, and how to optimize model performance by adjusting these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in thinking is, in essence, a deep reflection on AI research and application. Moving from simple black-box operations to truly understanding the internal workings of models has led many technical personnel and investors to begin reassessing the future direction of artificial intelligence. DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s popularity exemplifies this breakthrough application, prompting people to focus on the entire model construction and optimization process, rather than just the final output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s sudden surge in popularity, Nvidia’s stock plunge, and the short-selling operations of institutions behind the market – all this seems to be part of a carefully designed scheme. Through an in-depth understanding of large language model thinking chains, we can see that the application of AI technology is not merely a superficial accumulation of features but rather a deep exploration and optimization of the model&amp;rsquo;s internal logic. As technology advances, we may witness more innovative tools like DeepSeek, driving AI research and applications to higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon not only shows us the immense potential of AI technology but also prompts us to begin thinking about the commercial competition and capital operations behind the technology. The future trend of the market will be a continued focus of the interplay between technology and capital.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
