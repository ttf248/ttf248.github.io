        <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Spring Festival, DeepSeek had become a hot topic, attracting widespread attention on social media in just a few days. This sudden surge in popularity was astonishing and triggered a chain reaction in the market. Meanwhile, NVIDIA’s stock price plummeted, raising concerns among many investors, with some institutions conducting large-scale short selling during this period, seemingly pointing to a “carefully orchestrated” situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deepseeks-sudden-surge-in-popularity-rapidly-becoming-a-focus&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DeepSeek&amp;rsquo;s Sudden Surge in Popularity: Rapidly Becoming a Focus&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is an AI-powered tool focused on optimizing deep learning models, particularly in the applications of natural language processing (NLP) and image generation. In the days leading up to Chinese New Year, this project suddenly garnered significant attention from investors and tech professionals alike. The performance of its team and the demonstrated technical results sparked strong interest among many. Discussions about DeepSeek dominated all topics within the developer community and on social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, DeepSeek’s sudden surge in popularity was not accidental. After analysis, many began to suspect that certain entities may have been involved behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nvidia-stock-plummets-the-hand-behind-the-short-selling-operation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia Stock Plummets: The Hand Behind the Short Selling Operation&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia, a global leader in graphics processing units (GPUs), has long been a key hardware provider for many large models and AI computations. With the rapid development of the AI market, Nvidia’s stock has performed strongly over the long term and even become a favorite among many investors. However, with the explosive popularity of DeepSeek and the market&amp;rsquo;s intense focus on its technology, Nvidia’s stock experienced a dramatic plunge.
The underlying cause of this phenomenon may involve institutional investor short selling strategies. Over the past few years, as AI technology has proliferated, Nvidia’s stock price has been significantly inflated, leading many investors to believe that it carries risks of excessive speculation. Particularly after a technology like DeepSeek went viral, some institutions may have profited substantially by shorting Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;chain-of-thought-reasoning-with-large-models-from-results-to-process&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Large Models: From “Results” to “Process”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In traditional artificial intelligence applications, many practitioners and investors have focused more on the “results” of AI models – such as generated images or text – rather than the underlying reasoning process. In discussions related to DeepSeek, an increasing number of people are beginning to realize that the chain-of-thought hidden behind large models is the core content worth paying attention to. Previously, we could only see the model’s output results, but now we need to understand the logic, algorithms, and how to optimize the model&amp;rsquo;s performance by adjusting these factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in thinking represents a deep reflection on AI research and application. From simple black-box operations to a genuine shift towards understanding the internal workings of models, leading many technologists and investors to re-evaluate the future direction of artificial intelligence. The popularity of DeepSeek perfectly represents a breakthrough in this thought chain; it prompted people to focus on the entire model construction and optimization process, rather than just the final output results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sudden surge in popularity of DeepSeek, NVIDIA’s stock plummet, and the subsequent short-selling activities by institutions – it all seems like a meticulously designed scheme. Through an in-depth understanding of large model chain-of-thought reasoning, we can see that the application of AI technology is not merely superficial layering of phenomena, but also deep digging and optimization of the model’s internal logic. As the technology progresses, we may likely see more innovative tools like DeepSeek in the future, driving AI research and applications to a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon not only shows us the immense potential of AI technology, but also prompts us to start thinking about the commercial games and capital operations behind the technology. The future market trajectory will continue to be a focus of the ongoing battle between technology and capital.&lt;/p&gt;
