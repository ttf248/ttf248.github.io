&lt;li&gt;Often, at some stage of life, people find themselves in a state of confusion, not knowing what they truly want, and gradually losing their pursuit of the meaning of work amidst the mundane daily routines. Looking back to when I first graduated, my heart was full of fervent aspirations – then I would without hesitation say, “I yearn to write code, to create brilliant, eye-catching code.” However, working until today, I’ve had more exposure to business-level affairs, which is largely due to the benefits brought by industry development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of my lifestyle, I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet included marriage and having children, or establishing a family, in my thinking; my mind is almost blank, only focused on enjoying the present moment. Whenever weekends arrive, I enjoy quietly playing games, often spending an entire day staying at home, immersed in my own little world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life, we always need something we truly love and dedicate ourselves to wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buying-a-house&#34;&gt;Buying a House
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I was full of enthusiasm and planned to save diligently to buy my own property. I meticulously budgeted every day towards this goal. However, as house prices continued to rise, I transitioned from initial anxiety and disappointment to eventually becoming numb, gradually feeling that even if I bought a house, it would simply be a heavy burden I’d been carrying around – ultimately leading me to abandon the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;saving-money&#34;&gt;Saving Money
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, saving money was about achieving some small goals, such as building a high-performance desktop computer, purchasing a long-desired camera, or taking an impromptu trip. However, now I approach saving with a more relaxed and “chill” attitude, no longer worrying too much about daily expenses – I indulge in things I want to eat and boldly try new and exciting things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;returning-home&#34;&gt;Returning Home
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I realized that what I most longed for deep down was simply to go home. There wasn’t anything particularly to do, just returning to that familiar place, feeling the warmth and tranquility of home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
