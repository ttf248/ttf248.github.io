        <title>The End of the Era of Wild Capitalism: The League of Legends Esports Era Ends</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-era-league-of-legends-esports/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The esports industry has experienced rapid development over the past decade and a half, becoming an undeniable cultural phenomenon worldwide. In particular, MOBA games represented by 《英雄联盟》(League of Legends, abbreviated as LOL) not only provide players with competitive enjoyment but also inject powerful momentum for capital, driving the flourishing growth of various esports platforms and events. However, with the influx of capital and the rise of the pan-entertainment industry, all this has entered a stage of gradual decline. The rise and fall of Panda TV, and the competition between Douyu and Huya, mark the end of the “era of wild capitalism,” and the favorable conditions, location, and people for the esports industry seem to be undergoing changes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-investment&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Investment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early esports: from grassroots to professionalism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early esports industry had a relatively grassroots start, especially in the Chinese market. Many players participated in competitions for games like StarCraft and Dota, driven by their love of gaming. However, the true rise of esports began with the release and promotion of League of Legends. After League of Legends officially entered the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche circle into part of mainstream culture. Particularly starting in 2013, the LPL (Chinese professional league) steadily took shape, and League of Legends became the cornerstone of China&amp;rsquo;s esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital is pouring in wildly: The Rise of Panda TV and Esports Streaming Platforms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 was a turning point for the esports industry in China. The influx of capital transformed esports from purely competitive events into a much larger industrial chain. Panda TV, as one of its representatives, became a product of excess capital. Founded by Wang Sicong (one of the founders of Panda Live), it quickly rose to prominence, attracting a large audience and user base with its innovative content and massive investment. However, this was also a typical example of &amp;ldquo;barbaric&amp;rdquo; capital flowing into the market – the frantic pursuit of capital often lacks patience and long-term vision. While Panda TV&amp;rsquo;s financial and human resources resulted in certain achievements in the short term, it ultimately declared bankruptcy in 2019 due to management issues and over-reliance on capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live Streaming Platform Competition: A &amp;ldquo;Capital War&amp;rdquo; Between Douyu and Huya&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fall of Panda TV did not lead to a decline in the esports live streaming industry, but rather spurred the rise of platforms like Douyu and Huya. The two major live streaming platforms quickly became leaders in the esports industry, and their competition intensified. Douyu initially gained prominence through the broadcast of League of Legends professional matches and the signing of top streamers, establishing itself as a benchmark for esports live streaming. Huya, on the other hand, gradually narrowed the gap with Douyu by increasing investment in esports events and diversifying its platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this process, capital once again played a significant role. Bilibili successfully went public in 2018, and Huya also conducted an IPO that same year. The rapid flow of capital led to high concentration within the industry and resulted in intense competition between platforms regarding anchors, copyrights, and other aspects, forming a &amp;ldquo;capital war.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-convergence-of-pan-entertainment-and-esports&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Convergence of Pan-Entertainment and Esports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trend of Pan-Entertainment: Capital Flows Towards Diversified Entertainment Projects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With renewed investment from capital in the esports industry, the content on esports platforms is gradually becoming more entertainment-focused. Esports anchors are no longer limited to match commentary and event broadcasts; they have begun to expand into various forms of entertainment such as singing, dancing, and interactive live streams. The platform&amp;rsquo;s content has become richer, gradually forming a content ecosystem centered around esports but incorporating diverse entertainment elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the trend of pervasive entertainment has also brought problems – esports&amp;rsquo; original focus on gaming culture is gradually being marginalized, replaced by a trend that prioritizes entertainment above all else. This trend has caused some viewers who were originally deeply passionate about esports culture to feel alienated, and capital has begun to shift its attention to other entertainment sectors. The excessive influx of capital and the pursuit of profit are causing the essence of the esports industry to gradually become blurred, and the core value concept centered on competition is beginning to weaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rise of the Pan-Entertainment Industry: Capital Retreat and Transformation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and other pan-entertainment industries have risen, capital has gradually shifted funds from esports to a broader range of entertainment content. In this process, giants like Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance no longer rely solely on esports projects as a source of profit but have increased their investment in areas such as film, music, and short videos. Particularly the rise of ByteDance, through the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin, has overshadowed esports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-the-break-in-continuity-of-the-league-of-legends-era-dividends-fade&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: The &amp;ldquo;Break in Continuity&amp;rdquo; of the League of Legends: Era Dividends Fade
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since League of Legends entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has almost become synonymous with the esports industry in China, creating countless professional players, teams, and events, and fostering a massive esports ecosystem. However, more than ten years have passed, and as a leading project in Chinese esports, League of Legends is entering a stage of “generational shift.” Especially in recent years, League of Legends&amp;rsquo; influence has been gradually declining, and even showing clear signs of recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layering of Player Groups
The most noticeable change is the generational shift in the player base. Initially, esports&amp;rsquo; rapid development relied on the support of a large number of young players, many of whom became professional players or viewers because of League of Legends. That generation of internet-addicted youth almost grew up under &amp;ldquo;demographic dividend,&amp;rdquo; immersed in the competitive appeal of LOL and thus driving the industry’s rapid expansion. However, as time passed, these players gradually matured, entered society, and began to shift towards other life and career paths. At the same time, the new generation of young players&amp;rsquo; interest in League of Legends is not as fervent as it used to be, and esports audiences are showing a clear age bias and declining interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.2 The &amp;ldquo;Weakness&amp;rdquo; of Game Content
League of Legends, after numerous updates and revisions, while still retaining a certain competitive appeal, has shown signs of struggling to innovate. Annual version updates, hero balance adjustments, and the introduction of new gameplay mechanics have seemingly failed to fundamentally address players&amp;rsquo; need for novelty. At the same time, the MOBA market is becoming saturated, and other game genres (such as Honor of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite) have rapidly risen in popularity, diverting a large number of players who previously played League of Legends. This competitive landscape has kept League of Legends perpetually in the role of a &amp;ldquo;follower.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-where-will-the-esports-industry-go-from-here&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Where will the esports industry go from here?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The esports industry is more like a skyscraper that sprung up seemingly out of nowhere. Excessive capital wanders within the internet sector, searching for the next trend, and esports has become one of their targets. Relying on China&amp;rsquo;s demographic dividend, the esports industry achieved tremendous success in a short period, but this success isn’t built on a solid foundation. Over-investment of capital, talent shortages, and weak game content – these issues are all hindering the healthy development of the esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before college, I didn&amp;rsquo;t play many games. League of Legends accompanied a generation’s growth. Having watched so many finals, as an outsider, comparing Chinese and Korean players, especially Faker, domestic players always feel hesitant and fearful during major tournaments. I understand the psychological pressure on players is immense, but this industry has been developing for over ten years. Psychological issues among players should have been prioritized by teams, but they haven’t been. The gameplay in China still relies on players&amp;rsquo; innate talent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>From Games to Family: Why We Gradually Disconnect from Virtual Worlds as We Grow Up</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:11:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thinking about when gaming is most enjoyable, is it sneaking away as a child to play Tank Battle, Super Mario, and Contra on the family TV, or secretly playing Age of Empires with my cousin on the family computer, or perhaps later in college, playing games like Devil May Cry and League of Legends with my roommates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you were a child, free from life&amp;rsquo;s worries, when you played, you really put your whole heart into it – that sense of immersion is something you can never find again as an adult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As times change and society progresses, we who were once active in the virtual world are gradually realizing that the gaming platform, once full of joy and competition, seems to be drifting away from our lives. The disconnection of game social links, accompanied by players gradually moving on, is not only due to technological advancements and the replacement of games themselves, but also because of a shift in the center of our lives. As we grow older, we become busy with marriage and having children, and the main focus of life gradually shifts from personal entertainment to family responsibilities. Today, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss the deeper reasons behind this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disappearance-of-gaming-socialization-a-tug-of-war-between-virtual-and-real-worlds&#34;&gt;The Disappearance of Gaming Socialization: A Tug-of-War Between Virtual and Real Worlds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people&amp;rsquo;s youth, games were more than just entertainment; they were a way to socialize. A popular online multiplayer game not only provided in-game challenges and competition but also connected players from all over the world, building virtual social circles. In that era, playing dungeons and team PKing with friends was part of life. Those late-night voice chats and sharing daily experiences became part of our memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as time passed, more and more players discovered that this virtual social experience didn&amp;rsquo;t have lasting appeal. With game updates and the diversification of social platforms, players gradually found more ways to interact outside of games. Friends made in games slowly disappeared from our lives, and many connections once active within the games were silently severed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;games-and-responsibility-a-shift-in-lifes-focus-after-adulthood&#34;&gt;Games and Responsibility: A Shift in Life&amp;rsquo;s Focus After Adulthood
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entering adulthood, the responsibilities in life gradually increase. Many young people once invested a lot of time in games, but with the start of their careers or living together with partners and starting families, these previously seemingly essential leisure activities begin to be squeezed by the responsibilities of real life. Marriage, having children, or even caring for parents – these major responsibilities in life force people to make choices about energy and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming has become a thing of the past, replaced by the prioritization of family life. Many young people who once &amp;ldquo;struggled&amp;rdquo; in games are gradually realizing that real-life is the most important subject. Especially after having children, the center of gravity in their lives completely shifts towards family, and gaming is gradually squeezed to the periphery of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-games-to-family-how-changes-in-life-affect-our-entertainment-habits&#34;&gt;From Games to Family: How Changes in Life Affect Our Entertainment Habits
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our life experiences, family is one of the most important components. Once we enter family life, the allocation of time and energy becomes more specific and limited. To take care of children and spend time with their partners, many young parents find that they no longer have enough time to focus on the games they once loved. Sometimes, they even stop pursuing game updates and new features. Gradually, social platforms and offline interactions with friends and family become the preferred choice for socializing for more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we’ve completely abandoned entertainment, but rather chosen ways that are more suitable for our current life stage. Many friends who used to maintain connections through games may now choose other ways to stay in touch due to different life paths, such as family gatherings, meals together, and short trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;farewell-to-the-virtual-world-how-do-we-view-this-transition&#34;&gt;Farewell to the virtual world: How do we view this transition?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many who once immersed themselves in gaming, saying goodbye to game-related social interactions isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. After all, that virtual world that once brought us joy and a sense of accomplishment has long become part of our memories. However, farewell doesn’t mean severing ties completely; instead, as life changes, we begin to make different choices to balance our roles in real life. As we grow older, we transition from inexperienced youths into responsible adults, and while gaming still holds value, it can no longer be the main theme of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this shift also reflects an aspect of human adaptability—our ability to adjust our focus and lifestyle according to different stages. When responsibility and family become the core of life, gaming socialization is no longer a priority but rather a form of occasional leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-of-gaming-perhaps-it-will-usher-in-another-wave-of-sense-of-belonging&#34;&gt;The future of gaming: perhaps it will usher in another wave of &amp;ldquo;sense of belonging.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, with social development and technological advancements, the forms and content of games are also constantly evolving. For example, current online multiplayer games have begun to move towards more relaxed and flexible approaches, and some even emphasize family interaction and parent-child relationships in their design. In the future, we may see more game formats that better integrate into family life and provide players with healthier, more balanced social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as many people still feel nostalgia and passion when talking about &amp;ldquo;childhood games,&amp;rdquo; perhaps in the future, we too may unexpectedly pick up those old games again, entering that virtual world once more with new understanding and insights&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-is-changing-but-love-remains&#34;&gt;Life is changing, but love remains
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s games or family, the changes in life always accompany our growth. In this process, we gradually realize that although the virtual world brings us endless joy and excitement, ultimately, we return to reality, to that warmest place – family. We don’t need to regret leaving games behind, because every stage of life has its own unique meaning. And these changes are precisely what make us become more complete individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The multifaceted nature of games: a convergence of psychological development and social entertainment</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 15:07:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, gaming is no longer just a simple form of entertainment but has become an indispensable part of people’s daily lives. From a psychological perspective, games play different roles in the psychological development of people at different ages and are also closely linked to social recreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-state&#34;&gt;Mental state
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games provide young people with a low-cost environment for experimentation and exploration, as they are at a stage of exploring themselves and establishing their identity. Through games, they can try on different roles and lives, satisfying their curiosity and desire to explore. As they get older, however, personal interests and values gradually stabilize, and games may no longer align with their life goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes&#34;&gt;Social attributes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, gaming has become part of social activity, especially for young people. They make friends and build social networks through games; gaming serves as a bridge for socializing. However, as people age, their social circles gradually stabilize, and social needs may be met through other more mature means, diminishing the role of gaming in socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attribute-taking-a-girl-out&#34;&gt;Social attribute: Taking a girl out
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, due to a lack of relationship education, parents often only emphasize studying well during childhood and then immediately push you into dating after graduation—this is a very common phenomenon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of busy studies, work, or a lack of social skills, they haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to establish stable emotional relationships in real life, leading to feelings of loneliness and a desire for attention. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Carrying&amp;rdquo; behavior in games provides an outlet for this longing; by helping and protecting female players, they experience the feeling of being needed and valued, achieving emotional fulfillment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the game&amp;rsquo;s interactive rules are clear and the environment is controllable. Compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real life, games offer a sense of certainty and security, reducing fear of unpredictability in real-world interactions. However, long-term reliance on virtual gratification within games may affect their ability to establish and maintain healthy emotional relationships in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reality-pressure&#34;&gt;Reality pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game provides a virtual world where players can temporarily escape the stress, challenges, or unpleasant emotions of reality. This is especially true for young people facing academic pressure, family problems, or interpersonal relationship challenges; gaming may become a way for them to seek comfort and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are typically designed to give players a sense of accomplishment and recognition when they complete tasks, level up, or defeat opponents. Young people may become addicted to games because they can gain a feeling of being appreciated and recognized in the game, which they may lack in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-getting-older-they-dont-like-playing-anymore&#34;&gt;After getting older, they don&amp;rsquo;t like playing anymore
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young, individuals face relatively fewer social responsibilities and pressures, allowing more time and energy to be devoted to games. As they enter the workforce, start families, and other social responsibilities increase, time and energy become more valuable, and gaming may be seen as a time-consuming activity rather than a preferred leisure choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, their cognitive abilities and interests change. What might appeal to someone in their youth—fast-paced action games with flashy graphics—may later give way to a preference for strategic, story-driven, or deeply engaging games. If the market cannot meet these evolving needs, interest will naturally decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>When you want to make money</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/when-you-want-to-make-money/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 03:23:53 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/when-you-want-to-make-money/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ordinary people are social creatures, that&amp;rsquo;s right, you are a person and an upright-walking animal with strong social attributes; you have feelings of inferiority and vanity. Society is constantly changing and eroding your sense of calm. We don’t discuss those great individuals who willingly burn themselves for society or the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;me-now&#34;&gt;Me now
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at average wages, or even considering salaries back home, my current income is already far above average – what more could I possibly be unsatisfied with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you earn ten thousand, you&amp;rsquo;ll think about earning a million; when you earn a million, you&amp;rsquo;ll think about earning ten million. This is human nature, and people must confront their own inner selves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s that red-eyed thing, is it a more relaxed way of making money: short videos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone understands that entering this industry isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. What you see here is a short video, but what you don’t see is the scriptwriting and filming behind it. But everyone has a dream of being a genius, believing they are suited for that industry, that they are naturally gifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;begin-to-contact&#34;&gt;Begin to contact
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve watched so many videos. If you analyze the shots a little bit with your own brain, it’s obvious they have professional editing techniques and a very strong cinematic feel. Basically, that means some of them are from film school backgrounds. Of course, there’s logic behind grassroots success stories, but that doesn’t apply to most people, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Douyin, there are also many videos teaching you how to make videos. It&amp;rsquo;s then that people realize things – if it were truly profitable, why wouldn’t they do it themselves instead of teaching others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;anti-human-recommendation-algorithm&#34;&gt;Anti-human recommendation algorithm
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, when Douyin&amp;rsquo;s algorithm recommended movie clips and anime clips, I would keep watching them and find them quite interesting. But then, when I started looking into how to make money on Douyin, it began recommending all sorts of tutorial videos non-stop, filling my entire recommendation feed. And I’m in the IT industry myself. At this point, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if those guys who designed the algorithm had a problem with their heads – are you suggesting that I&amp;rsquo;m stupid or that they&amp;rsquo;re stupid? The key thing is, it keeps finding new ways to recommend videos on how to make money using Douyin, trying different angles and types. This article is being written by me at 3 AM, and I didn’t even want to write it. I just wonder how long this business model can last, and for how long can it consume everyone&amp;rsquo;s time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understand-life&#34;&gt;Understand life
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s laughable when you lecture others on how to do things, but can’t control yourself when it comes to your own actions. Not a pure technical blog writer, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t published some things domestically. Here, I just casually rant. If this gets shut down someday, I guess I’ll find another place. I can’t say Douyin hasn’t done anything; at least now, in terms of real-time news dissemination and promotion of national policies, they are actively cooperating. After all, in China, you can&amp;rsquo;t go against the Party, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back to when I was studying, it strikes me. When you truly can&amp;rsquo;t find the meaning of life, quietly reading a book is enough. In this era, how many people can still sit down and read quietly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also want to thank the advancements in science and technology here. If you can see this line, you’ll notice that the entire draft is very conversational. And honestly, I just kept reading it until it was finished. I used to use Sogou Input Method, for about seven or eight years. But when it comes to voice input, I have to say that iFlytek is still the professional choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article number for 2022 changed to 002. Why are there two extra zeros? Having a dream that the number of articles this year can exceed one hundred – that’s a dream for me. It can&amp;rsquo;t really be called articles, just some records. I examine myself three times a day; you’ll surely think of something, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
