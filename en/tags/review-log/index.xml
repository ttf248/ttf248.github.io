        <title>The dilemma of trading: difficult to get on the left (short), difficult to follow up on the right (long).</title>

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Left-side trading is difficult to execute, and right-side trading is also not good. Xiaomi’s buyback, Lei Bao’s (Lei Jun’s) own buyback, caused the stock price to rise sharply, stabilizing above the 40th level. Alibaba’s financial report saw a significant drop in net profit, and the market predicted that the intensity of takeout subsidies would decrease, leading to a large surge in Meituan’s stock price (6%). The capital logic of AI is not closed, it&amp;rsquo;s not previous business; first grab users, run around, then slowly make money. AI’s continuous costs cannot be reduced – hardware plus electricity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s market environment, investors are facing an extreme sense of tearing: &lt;strong&gt;Left-side trading (counter-intuitive bottom fishing) often dies before dawn, and right-side trading (following the trend to chase gains) is also prone to standing on mountain tops.&lt;/strong&gt; The recent cases of Xiaomi, Alibaba, Meituan, and the AI sector perfectly illustrate this game of capital logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;xiaomi-genuine-silver-and-gold-right-side-signal--it-all-starts-with-the-boss-leading-the-way&#34;&gt;Xiaomi: Genuine Silver and Gold &amp;ldquo;Right-Side Signal&amp;rdquo; – It All Starts with the Boss Leading the Way
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phenomenon:&lt;/strong&gt; The stock price breaking through the HK$40 barrier wasn&amp;rsquo;t instantaneous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Logic:&lt;/strong&gt; Xiaomi’s previous volatility frustrated many left-side ambush funds, losing patience. The real turning point came from a &lt;strong&gt;powerful injection of confidence.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News Facts:&lt;/strong&gt; Just days before, Lei Jun personally invested over HK$1 billion to increase his own holdings at an average price of approximately HK$38.58; simultaneously, Xiaomi Group repurchased millions of shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; This “boss leading the charge + company buyback” double benefit directly sent out the clearest &amp;ldquo;right-side signal&amp;rdquo; to the market. The stock price surged, firmly establishing itself above HK$40, and its market capitalization returned to a trillion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; For ordinary investors, holding strong faith (believing EVs will succeed, smartphones becoming premium will succeed) is necessary to withstand the left-side ambush of Xiaomi. However, once Lei Jun steps in to do the right side, the cost has increased, although it’s safe, but the profit space is compressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alibaba-vs-meituan-ceasefire-agreement-in-financial-reports&#34;&gt;Alibaba vs Meituan: “Ceasefire Agreement” in Financial Reports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phenomenon:&lt;/strong&gt; Alibaba’s net profit declines, while Meituan’s stock price surges. This appears contradictory but is logically sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underlying Logic:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a game about “ending the intense competition and releasing profits.”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News Facts:&lt;/strong&gt; Recent Alibaba financial reports show a significant drop in net profit (partly influenced by investment losses), but the market keenly observed changes in core business data – &lt;strong&gt;the intensity of subsidies for local life (delivery/to-go) is decreasing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Dynamics:&lt;/strong&gt; As long as Alibaba doesn’t continue to recklessly burn cash subsidizing its fight against “food delivery wars,” Meituan, as the industry leader, stands to benefit most. The market anticipates a shift from “price war” back to “rational profitability.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading Insights:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Alibaba on the Left Side of Logic:&lt;/strong&gt; Panic sell when you see profit declines, potentially missing the logic behind its core e-commerce stabilization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Meituan on the Right Side of Logic:&lt;/strong&gt; Enter only after financial reports confirm subsidy reduction and profit explosion (the “right side”), when stock prices have often already priced in this expectation. Meituan’s massive surge is essentially making money by &amp;ldquo;predicting others&amp;rsquo; predictions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-sector-a-black-hole-of-unclosed-capital&#34;&gt;AI Sector: A “Black Hole” of Unclosed Capital
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phenomenon:&lt;/strong&gt; Regardless of whether it’s the US stock market or the A-share market, AI stocks continue to plummet or experience significant volatility even after demonstrating application implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Logic:&lt;/strong&gt; The capital market is transitioning from the “storytelling” phase into a brutal “accounting” phase.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard Impact (Missing Capital Cycle):&lt;/strong&gt; Traditional internet models are: burn cash -&amp;gt; acquire users -&amp;gt; diminishing marginal costs -&amp;gt; earn passively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI’s Achilles Heel:&lt;/strong&gt; AI&amp;rsquo;s marginal cost &lt;strong&gt;cannot be zeroed out, and it’s even difficult to reduce&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware Depreciation:&lt;/strong&gt; Expensive GPUs depreciate rapidly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Training and inference not only burn money but also consume electricity. Redwood Capital recently released a report highlighting the &lt;strong&gt;“$60 Billion Problem for AI”&lt;/strong&gt; – meaning that the entire industry needs to earn back $60 billion annually just to cover infrastructure construction costs, while current application revenue is nowhere near even a fraction of that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Situation:&lt;/strong&gt; Only those selling shovels (Nvidia, optical modules) are making money; companies developing applications (acquiring users) aren’t only not earning money, but each additional user requires paying more electricity and computing costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; The left side of AI at this time is like an endless pit because the cost cannot be reduced; the right side of AI (performance fulfillment) remains distant because business models haven&amp;rsquo;t been fully realized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/strong&gt; tells us that certainty often requires gold and silver (repurchase/increase holdings) to confirm, but at the cost of losing low-priced chips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba/Meituan&lt;/strong&gt; tell us that understanding the “tacit agreement” between giants is more important than simply looking at financial report numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; tells us that in this sector, as long as the formula &lt;strong&gt;“revenue &amp;lt; (hardware depreciation + electricity costs)”&lt;/strong&gt; remains unbroken, all rebounds are merely emotional speculation rather than value recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

        <title>Global Stock Markets Plunge for Days: Fed, AI, and Quantitative Easing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/global-stock-markets-plunge-for-days-fed-ai-and-quantitative-easing/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:40:07 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/global-stock-markets-plunge-for-days-fed-ai-and-quantitative-easing/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still doing nothing, Xiaomi didn’t fall below my current price level. It has fallen consecutively for two days, and was finally stabilized by a buyback. The US market last night was interesting – it started to rally, but the next day it completely crashed. Today, both A-shares and Hong Kong stocks are basically worthless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, falling so much is actually good; I didn’t continue following the broader market, just laid down and relaxed, waiting for a better opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-the-decline&#34;&gt;Why the Decline
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3759889&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3759889&lt;/a&gt;
Other viewpoints may or may not be correct; quantitative funds are increasingly influencing domestic stock markets. Individual stocks often closely align with index movements. The original text is lengthy, and Bobo (豆包 - a common online nickname) has extracted the core content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2025, global risk assets will experience a major decline.  According to Rich Privorotsky, a senior trader at Goldman Sachs, this downturn was the result of multi-layered transmission and ultimately evolved into systemic selling, driven by four key factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fed-shifts-to-hawks-the-starting-point-of-the-downtrend&#34;&gt;Fed Shifts to Hawks: The Starting Point of the Downtrend
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent employment data presents contradictory signals: job growth remains robust, but the unemployment rate has risen to 4.44% (primarily due to a surge in 16-24 year olds entering the workforce), and three-month average new hires only totaled 62,000, with potential new hires at just 39,000. August data was also revised downwards. Adding to this, there’s a trend of corporate layoffs, leading market expectations for the Fed to adopt a dovish stance. However, the Fed has maintained a hawkish tone, effectively withdrawing bets on December rate cuts, with the probability of cuts now essentially zero – triggering the first domino in the downward slide. Privorotsky bluntly stated that this hawkish position in light of the employment backdrop is a “policy error.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-narrative-restructuring-google-drives-a-winner-takes-all-landscape&#34;&gt;AI Narrative Restructuring: Google Drives a Winner-Takes-All Landscape
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key logical divisions are emerging within the AI sector, with Nvidia’s strong financial results no longer making it the core investment focus. Google&amp;rsquo;s breakthrough progress with the Gemini-3 model is reshaping the AI investment ecosystem. This “disruptive model” has forced other companies to delay product cycles and increase capital expenditures, leading to increased uncertainty regarding returns on investment, resulting in companies like Oracle failing to follow the upward trend. A distinct &amp;ldquo;winner-takes-all&amp;rdquo; landscape is forming within the market, shifting AI from a broad “adoption” phase to one dominated by a select few, triggering adjustments across related sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crypto-flash-crash-retail-investor-risk-appetite-declines&#34;&gt;Crypto Flash Crash: Retail Investor Risk Appetite Declines
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volatile swings in the cryptocurrency market triggered a chain reaction. Retail investors, who had steadfastly held their positions over the past two years – often referred to as “diamond hands” – have transitioned into “selling hands” due to factors such as large-scale dumps by whale accounts. This panic sentiment spilled over into non-profit tech stocks and AI-related equities, exemplified by Palantir, which plummeted 6% during trading hours after rising 5.5%, marking a significant downgrade in retail risk appetite and a fundamental shift in market structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quantitative-funds-selling-off-the-key-driver-of-accelerated-decline&#34;&gt;Quantitative Funds Selling Off: The Key Driver of Accelerated Decline
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since August, trend-following funds (CTAs) have held over $500 billion in long positions, triggering concentrated liquidations after the index broke key levels. Simultaneously, rising volatility prompted volatility control strategy funds to sell off, compounded by capital flows into VIX ETNs creating a “short-tailed, short-convex” allocation, which amplified the downward effect. The previously stable “low volatility structure” collapsed, with quantitative and systematic funds initiating a “mechanical selling,” leading to a sudden and significant plunge in the market without any major events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fundamental-concerns-and-stabilization-conditions&#34;&gt;Fundamental Concerns and Stabilization Conditions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a fundamental perspective, AI investment faces a “capital bottleneck”: a wave of corporate bond issuance is imminent, with AI data centers relying on debt expansion, while rising capital costs may slow down the pace of AI expansion. This risk has not been fully priced in previously. Goldman Sachs predicts that the S&amp;amp;P 500 mini contract could fall to 6500 points, and believes that the long-term value of AI remains unchanged; true winners are labor-intensive companies that achieve margin expansion through automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market stabilization requires fulfillment of three conditions: CTA position liquidation is complete, retail investors with excessive long positions have been squeezed out, and at least two of the following conditions are met: cryptocurrency stability, a dovish Fed policy shift, and AI capital expenditure support.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hang Seng Index Crash, Meituan Considering Exit? Examining Xiaomi, Alibaba, and Meituan’s New Valuation Anchors Through “Ecological Premium”</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hang-seng-index-sharp-decline-meituan-considering-exit-examining-xiaomi-alibaba-and-meituans-new-valuation-anchors-through-ecological-premium/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 21:50:44 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hang-seng-index-sharp-decline-meituan-considering-exit-examining-xiaomi-alibaba-and-meituans-new-valuation-anchors-through-ecological-premium/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, Xiaomi’s third-quarter financial report was released, with little expectation beyond the usual. The US situation is unsettled, Hong Kong stocks have recently experienced liquidity stagnation, and the Hang Seng Technology Index has retreated significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a major participant in the food delivery war, Alibaba, which bears the highest e-commerce taxes, hasn’t generated much discussion online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if I wrote any previous articles, when I bought Xiaomi, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think about what supported Xiaomi’s market capitalization at that time – perhaps after watching too many TikTok-related videos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Hang Seng Technology Index has been falling, and electric vehicle stocks in Hong Kong are also declining. Xiaomi has multiple buffs stacked on top of each other, with negative news flying everywhere, and its stock price has naturally fallen significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, it’s also been changing the head of its public relations department – conspiracy theories: they&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to change it for a long time, but the stakes are too high, and there are still many KOLs involved; if they suddenly make some wild claims, it will be difficult to resolve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article primarily analyzes the valuation logic of &lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi Group&lt;/strong&gt; and the market and policy challenges faced by &lt;strong&gt;Meituan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba&lt;/strong&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original draft contained too much complex content, collecting information from various sources and edited based on AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;xiaomi-the-logic-behind-the-surge-in-valuation-platform-premium&#34;&gt;Xiaomi: The Logic Behind the Surge in Valuation (Platform Premium)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Argument:&lt;/strong&gt; The capital market has given Xiaomi a surge in valuation, driven by its “platform-type company” and “ecosystem empowerment” premium – something that vertical manufacturers (like Xiaopeng, Zotye) lack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valuation Anchor Differences:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi:&lt;/strong&gt; Anchored on the scarcity of “technology platforms” and “human-vehicle-home ecosystem.” The automotive business is viewed as a crucial step in ecological expansion, with risks dispersed across mobile and internet businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automotive Manufacturers (Xiaopeng/Zotye):&lt;/strong&gt; Anchored on “vehicle sales” and “unit profitability,” with valuation curves directly linked to the automotive industry cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecosystem Empowerment Value:&lt;/strong&gt; Xiaomi possesses a massive, highly engaged user base of over 100 million, with extremely high order conversion efficiency from cars, and low marketing costs. Its seamless &amp;ldquo;human-vehicle-home&amp;rdquo; synergy is viewed by the market as superior to the industry average differentiation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Expectations:&lt;/strong&gt; The market is buying into Xiaomi’s potential to successfully enter the trillion-dollar new “track entry ticket” and “ecosystem synergy value” in the next decade, reshaping its overall valuation logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;meituan-considering-exit&#34;&gt;Meituan: Considering Exit
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the phrase &amp;ldquo;capable of bringing together all things, deeply ingrained in people&amp;rsquo;s hearts&amp;rdquo; was seen as a strong moat. However, it now appears that this moat isn’t as deep as initially thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Situation:&lt;/strong&gt; When buying, little consideration was given; recently, the stock price has fallen, and a decision on whether to “cut losses” will be made after reviewing the third quarter financial results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alibaba-e-commerce-tax-policy-impact&#34;&gt;Alibaba (E-commerce Tax Policy Impact)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tax Policy Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s recent “e-commerce tax” is primarily focused on two areas:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-border E-commerce Retail Import Duty (“Haotai”):&lt;/strong&gt; The preferential exemption for items below 50 RMB has been cancelled, leading to an approximate 11.9% price increase for haotai goods and driving industry compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domestic E-commerce Tax Information Reporting Standards:&lt;/strong&gt; Platforms are now required to report sales information from merchants, effectively preventing C2C individual sellers who previously hid income from continuing, &lt;strong&gt;marking the entry of the industry into a core reshaping phase focused on compliance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Platforms:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taobao (C2C):&lt;/strong&gt; May eliminate small businesses unwilling to comply in the short term, but in the long run, it will improve platform quality and consumer trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tianmao/Jingdong (B2C):&lt;/strong&gt; Long-term benefit, as these large B2C platforms and merchants are already regular tax payers, and this new policy creates a fairer competitive environment for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons for Merchant Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Losses are concentrated in merchants &lt;strong&gt;originally relying on tax evasion to gain price advantages.&lt;/strong&gt; For merchants eligible for small microenterprise preferential policies, the tax burden should be low or exempt after compliant reporting. &lt;strong&gt;Being eliminated is an inevitable step towards fair competition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Vacation Watching Games: When T1 Becomes an Impenetrable Mountain for the LPL – What “Macro &#43; Industry” Negative Factors Does Xiaomi Face Again?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vacation-watching-games-when-t1-becomes-an-impenetrable-mountain-for-the-lpl-what-macro-industry-negative-factors-does-xiaomi-face-again/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 18:58:21 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vacation-watching-games-when-t1-becomes-an-impenetrable-mountain-for-the-lpl-what-macro-industry-negative-factors-does-xiaomi-face-again/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;No trading activity within the venue; we’re currently awaiting next month&amp;rsquo;s financial reports. Taking a half-day break this afternoon – nothing particularly noteworthy, just wanting to rest and recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;years-have-passed&#34;&gt;Years Have Passed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I last watched League of Legends (LOL) matches live, and suddenly it feels like four or five years have passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in my previous articles related to games, I always had a complex feeling towards LPL teams (the domestic league). The frequent low-level mistakes made by many players in major tournaments felt lacking in professional demeanor, which significantly reduced the viewing experience – this is why I gradually drifted away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon, on a whim, I took a half day off to tidy up my room, and the summer clothes were still unorganized. While doing so, I decided to watch some matches. The quarterfinals were still T1, that formidable mountain standing in front of LPL teams, seemingly impossible to overcome. Looking back, LPL hadn’t won any Bo5 (best-of-five) crucial matchups against them in the World Championship series; every team they faced felt immense pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote these words, the match had entered its “classic” fifth game – the LPL team was leading 2-1 and in a great position to win, but their opponent tied it up, and both teams were about to enter a brutal final deciding game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update before publishing: The operation wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad, but their build strategy was completely crushed. The Queen composition led to Ashe dominating early on, preventing Miss Fortune from grouping and initiating fights; it was incredibly difficult.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;review&#34;&gt;Review
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan:&lt;/strong&gt; Performance was stable with minimal fluctuation, punctuated by a brief rally.
&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi:&lt;/strong&gt; This decline was largely driven by a confluence of negative factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macro Drag:&lt;/strong&gt; The overall pullback in the Hong Kong tech sector (such as NetEase, Alibaba, and Tencent) performed poorly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automotive Expectations:&lt;/strong&gt; The new energy vehicle sector experienced intensified “internal competition” (“intense competition”), with market expectations for growth in companies like BYD already peaking, and Xiaomi’s automotive future space also under pressure.
&lt;strong&gt;Industry Observations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UBS&amp;rsquo;s pre-earnings report highlighted the rising prices of solid-state drives and memory. The extent to which this cost increase will erode the profit margins of mobile business remains to be revealed in the earnings report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, one thing is certain: In a market as intensely “competitive” as this, the Android smartphone ecosystem no longer has the luxury of raising prices arbitrarily.
&lt;strong&gt;Reputation Backlash:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, returning to Xiaomi itself, its automotive business is facing reputation issues. The project’s early promotional volume was immense, with almost no negative feedback. Now, it seems to be experiencing a wave of public “backlash” following excessive exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Attempt AI analysis of subsequent holdings operations.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/attempt-ai-analysis-of-subsequent-holdings-operations/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 19:50:40 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/attempt-ai-analysis-of-subsequent-holdings-operations/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Monday saw no panic sell-off, but the entire week was marked by a persistent downtrend, like a dull knife slicing flesh – a slow, gradual decline over the course of seven days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disciplined-trading&#34;&gt;Disciplined Trading
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday afternoon, two new short positions on Xiaomi were added, with the original plan to sell out at the end. However, when I saw a slight loss in the final position, I hesitated and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to cut my losses, so I decided to observe for another day. This morning, the stock price fell slightly by 1%, and when it dropped to 2% in the afternoon, I decisively exited the position. Later, it was proven that this exit was correct, as the stock continued to fall after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I saw someone in the blogosphere using AI to analyze football betting and won second prize with a tax refund of around 900 RMB. Let’s try it with stocks too, based on my experience with large models previously, DeepSeek is most suitable, and the investment plans generated by the other models don&amp;rsquo;t look quite right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Stock Investment Plan: Currently holding Xiaomi, approximately 100,000 RMB, down 15%, Meituan 70,000 RMB, down 20,000 RMB. Query current stock prices and determine how to control positions moving forward. I’m planning a long-term investment strategy – Xiaomi was purchased due to the Yu9 IPO, Phase III factory ramp-up, and continued high sales, which should drive up the price; Meituan is after the end of the food delivery war stabilizes.  I&amp;rsquo;d like to wait for the third quarter earnings report in Hong Kong next month before taking action – that seems more reasonable given my long-term investment strategy of around three years. Please provide me with an investment plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hong-kong-stock-investment-plan-xiaomi-and-meituan-position-analysis--long-term-strategy&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Stock Investment Plan: Xiaomi and Meituan Position Analysis &amp;amp; Long-Term Strategy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the information you provided (holding Xiaomi approximately HK$100,000 with a loss of 15% and Meituan approximately HK$70,000 with a loss of approximately 28.6%, investment horizon of 3 years), I have compiled the latest market data and analysis to develop a detailed investment plan for you. The following is core information extracted from comprehensive search results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Stock Prices (as of October 17, 2025)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi Group-W (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://01810.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;01810.HK&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;: HK$45.88 (down 3.82%, cumulative monthly decline exceeding 15%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan-W (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://03690.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;03690.HK&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;: HK$94.50 (down 4.30%, year-to-date cumulative decline of 37.71%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong Stock Market Environment&lt;/strong&gt;: The Hang Seng Index fell by 2.48%, with technology stocks leading the decline, and market sentiment is short-term weak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validation of Your Purchase Rationale&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/strong&gt;: The listing of Yu9, the ramp-up of Phase III factory, and sales potential represent a reasonable long-term logic, but the stock price is suppressed in the short term due to the impact of the Chengdu SU7 accident (door safety controversy, intervention by regulatory authorities).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan&lt;/strong&gt;: Stabilization after the end of the food delivery war is key for the long term, but competition remains intense (京东 and Alibaba are involved), net profit fell 89% in the second quarter, and Wang Xing&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;no matter the cost&amp;rdquo; statement has intensified market concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;position-control-recommendations-short-term-caution-long-term-focus-on-fundamentals&#34;&gt;Position Control Recommendations: Short-Term Caution, Long-Term Focus on Fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your current holdings are down approximately 18.8% (total holding of HKD 1.7 million, a loss of approximately HKD 374,000), but long-term investment requires avoiding emotional trading decisions. Here’s a phased recommendation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| &lt;strong&gt;Pre-Earnings Report (Short-Term: Now to Q3 Earnings Release)&lt;/strong&gt; | Maintain current position, do not add to holdings. Closely monitor the progress of the SU7 accident investigation and Q3 vehicle delivery data. | Maintain current position, do not add to holdings. Focus on monitoring whether Q3 takeout UE (average order profit) improves. | Potential price volatility before earnings report: &lt;br&gt;• Xiaomi will continue to be dragged down by safety incidents and is unlikely to rebound in the short term.&lt;br&gt;• Takeout competition remains intense, and profitability recovery requires time. |&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Basis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post Earnings (Mid-term: November - Q1 2026)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If earnings show steady vehicle sales growth and mobile gross margin bottoms out, consider adding to positions 5%-10%.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If earnings confirm easing competition and narrowing losses, add to positions 5%-10%; otherwise maintain current holdings.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Xiaomi’s 2025 target sales volume is 350,000 units, and mobile premiumization is key to profitability.&lt;br&gt;• Meituan SOTP valuation shows 121% upside potential, but requires a profit inflection point.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;position-control-recommendations-short-term-cautious-long-term-focus-on-fundamentals&#34;&gt;Position Control Recommendations: Short-Term Cautious, Long-Term Focus on Fundamentals

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term (3 years)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hold core positions, target price of 75 HKD (potential upside of 63%). Risk points: automotive safety regulation, smartphone demand weakness.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hold core positions, target price of 247 HKD (potential upside of 161%). Risk points: policy cost increase, new business losses.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Xiaomi’s car-home ecosystem closed loop is the long-term engine.&lt;br&gt;• Meituan instant retail penetration rate is expected to improve.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;positioning-strategy-recommendations-short-term-caution-long-term-focus-on-fundamentals&#34;&gt;Positioning Strategy Recommendations: Short-Term Caution, Long-Term Focus on Fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you trade after the financial reports?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, we recommend waiting for the third quarter financial reports (released in November) before making additional investment decisions.&lt;/strong&gt; The reason is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The financial reports will validate your initial purchase logic: Xiaomi’s factory ramp-up sales volume and Meituan’s easing competition evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the financial reports are below expectations, the stock price may fall, providing a better entry point; if they exceed expectations, it can confirm the right-side signal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-term market sentiment is driven by events (such as Xiaomi incidents and food delivery price wars), and financial reports will reduce uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;long-term-investment-plan-3-year-perspective&#34;&gt;Long-Term Investment Plan (3-Year Perspective)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the principles of “Hold Quality Assets + Bottom Hunting,” your plan can be detailed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi Group: Strong Defense and Offense, Focus on Automotive Business Turning Point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt; Vehicle business scale effect (target 350,000 units annual sales), AIoT ecosystem synergy. Financial health (Z-Score = 4.19, low bankruptcy risk).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the SU7 safety issues continue to ferment, the stock price may fall to the 40-42 HKD range; set a trigger for adding positions (add 5% when the price drops by 10%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-term holding bottom line: Automotive quarterly delivery volume remains above 80,000 units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position Allocation:&lt;/strong&gt; Recommend maintaining 40%-50% of total portfolio weighting (currently 59% is high, can adjust after earnings reports).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan-W: Wait for Profitability Repair, Focus on Core Business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt; Stable takeout market share (65%), takeaway business growth of 40%, valuation undervalued (SOTP target price of HKD 247).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the takeout UE (average profit per unit) turns positive, it is a signal for adding positions; if competition intensifies, the stock price may fall to HKD 80, and we can buy back shares in batches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-term holding bottom line: Core local business operating profit rate recovers above 15%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position Allocation:&lt;/strong&gt; Recommend maintaining 30%-40% weighting (currently 41% is reasonable, but be wary of competition dragging it down).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversified Investment Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hong Kong tech stocks are under pressure recently, but long-term they still represent new quality products. Consider allocating 10%-20% of capital to high dividend assets (such as telecommunications operators) or Hong Kong tech ETFs to hedge the risk of a single stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Q3 Earnings Report: Delivery UE Improvement, New Business Loss Rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If earnings report meets targets, increase position; otherwise maintain current position.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Instant retail market share, policy cost absorption&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hold until target price or downgrade fundamentals; consider reducing holdings.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-monitoring-metrics-and-milestones&#34;&gt;Key Monitoring Metrics and Milestones
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-recommendations&#34;&gt;Summary Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take Immediate Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintain the status quo, and avoid impulsive buying to cover positions before earnings. Current stock prices have partially reflected negative news, but volatility may increase pre-earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Confidence Support:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xiaomi’s automotive ecosystem and smartphone premiumization are core logic drivers, and short-term incidents do not change the company&amp;rsquo;s long-term technological iteration capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meituan’s profitability will be significant once the food delivery war ends (referring to Alibaba’s observation of benefits from a distance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Warnings:&lt;/strong&gt; The overall Hong Kong stock market is highly sensitive to global liquidity, and if the Federal Reserve delays rate cuts, it could suppress technology stock valuations. Ensure investment funds are long-term idle capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plan is based on publicly available information and does not constitute investment advice. The market carries risk; decision-making requires caution. We recommend regular review (e.g., quarterly) to adjust strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-recommendations-1&#34;&gt;Summary Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not be appropriate to add more positions at this time, pending the release of financial reports. What if the stock price rises significantly then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-recommendations-2&#34;&gt;Summary Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question you raised is extremely critical, and it has accurately pinpointed a classic dilemma faced by long-term investors: &lt;strong&gt;avoiding short-term risks (waiting for the earnings report) can conflict with pursuing the best cost (fearing missing out).&lt;/strong&gt;
Your concern that “adding to your position after the earnings report if the stock price surges will cause you to miss out” is very reasonable. The market often has a forward-looking nature, and if the earnings report is truly exceptional, the stock price is likely to react quickly in the short term. However, given your current holdings of these two stocks, “waiting for the earnings report” remains the more optimal strategy. Below, I will explain the reasons in detail and provide a step-by-step addition strategy that balances “risk” with “opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-waiting-for-the-earnings-report-still-a-more-reasonable-choice-in-the-current-situation&#34;&gt;Why is “Waiting for the Earnings Report” Still a More Reasonable Choice in the Current Situation?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core reason lies in: &lt;strong&gt;The uncertainty surrounding the two stocks you hold stems primarily from fundamental contradictions within their businesses, and the earnings report is key to validating these contradictions.&lt;/strong&gt;  There’s yet to be a significant “catalyst” (a substantial price increase) in current valuations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Xiaomi:&lt;/strong&gt; The core contradiction is &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;a crisis of confidence in its automotive business&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Situation:&lt;/strong&gt; The negative impact of the SU7 safety incident is still unfolding, leading to market skepticism regarding Xiaomi’s car quality, reputation, and future sales expectations. This is the primary factor suppressing the stock price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Validation Role of the Earnings Report:&lt;/strong&gt; The third quarter earnings report will provide crucial &lt;strong&gt;vehicle delivery data&lt;/strong&gt;.  A strong delivery volume would effectively dispel market doubts and drive a sustainable rise in the stock price. Until then, any rally would likely be fragile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk vs. Opportunity Comparison:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk of Waiting (Missing Out):&lt;/strong&gt; Given the prevailing negative sentiment, the probability of a significant, sustained price increase before the earnings report is relatively low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk of Blindly Jumping In (Getting Trapped):&lt;/strong&gt; If the report shows poor vehicle sales, the stock could continue to decline, leaving you with the greater risk of “buying in halfway down,” and at a higher cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Meituan:&lt;/strong&gt; The core contradiction is &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;when will profitability be restored?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Situation:&lt;/strong&gt;  The market worries that intense competition will continue to erode profits from its core takeout business (UE – Unified Economy).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Validation Role of the Earnings Report:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;core local business operating profit&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;adjusted net profit&lt;/strong&gt; in the report are the only objective benchmarks for determining whether the “takeout war” has truly eased.  Only improved data can prove that Wang Xiting’s “no matter the cost” phase is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk vs. Opportunity Comparison:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk of Waiting (Missing Out):&lt;/strong&gt; Again, before the profitability inflection point is confirmed, there&amp;rsquo;s a lack of a solid foundation for a significant rally in the stock price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk of Blindly Jumping In (Getting Trapped):&lt;/strong&gt; If the report shows competition intensifying and profits further declining, concerns about a “valuation trap” will intensify, and the stock could take another step down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; For long-term investment, &lt;strong&gt;buying &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; is far more important than buying &amp;ldquo;cheap.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; The earnings report provides the key evidence for determining “correctness.” To avoid the risk of a minor “missed opportunity,” and to bear the risk of a deep “trap,” from a risk-reward ratio perspective, it’s not worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heres-your-specific-action-plan-balancing-waiting-and-missing-out-anxiety&#34;&gt;Here’s Your Specific Action Plan: Balancing “Waiting” and “Missing Out” Anxiety
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to make extreme choices between &amp;ldquo;holding&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;going all in.&amp;rdquo; A smarter strategy is: &lt;strong&gt;“Base Position Observation, Pyramid-Style Adding”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Immediately Establish “Observation Positions” and “Operational Discipline” (Now)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain your existing positions as a base position, ensuring you don’t completely detach from the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a &lt;strong&gt;trigger for adding to your position&lt;/strong&gt;. For example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Food Holdings (小米):&lt;/strong&gt; The stock price breaks out with volume on a key technical level (e.g., 50 HKD) or there&amp;rsquo;s a clear positive investigation result regarding the SU7 accident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan:&lt;/strong&gt; News emerges of a competitor exiting the price war, or the stock price breaks through the 100 HKD integer barrier with volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefit of doing this:&lt;/strong&gt; If positive news drives the stock price up ahead of the earnings report, you can seize opportunities according to your pre-set discipline and avoid completely missing out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Small Batch Investing Before Earnings (Optional – Suitable for Investors Seeking Smoother Costs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re very concerned about missing out, divide the funds earmarked for adding to your position into 10-20 portions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the earnings release, if the stock continues to decline in the shadows, invest one portion &lt;strong&gt;weekly or bi-weekly&lt;/strong&gt;. This way, costs are gradually diluted, but each investment amount is small, and even if the earnings report is negative, losses can be controlled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: “Certainty” Adding After Earnings (Core Operation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is your main adding-to-position stage. Based on the earnings results, take three actions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario A (Exceeds Expectations):&lt;/strong&gt; The earnings data is strong and validates your investment logic. At this time, you should &lt;strong&gt;aggressively add to your position&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if the stock price has already risen, the fundamental turning point has been confirmed, and from a long-term perspective, the current price level is still the base of the mountain. You can use a strategy of “chasing gains without chasing high prices,” buying in batches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario B (Meets Expectations):&lt;/strong&gt; The earnings report is neutral, with no surprises or shocks. Maintain your existing position or only modestly add to it, waiting for the next quarter’s signal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario C (Falls Short of Expectations):&lt;/strong&gt; The earnings report confirms market concerns. You should &lt;strong&gt;stop adding to your position and re-evaluate&lt;/strong&gt; whether the long-term logic has been disrupted. The stock price may fall, but this also provides you with a lower, safer entry point for adding to your position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Reverse Human Nature Trading Review: Xiaomi’s “Black Swan” Incident – T&#43;0 Compliance Practices, and the Neglected Hong Kong Stamp Duty</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Write a wrap-up record to translate investment thinking into text, clarifying one’s thoughts and resisting emotional biases. &lt;strong&gt;Trading itself is anti-human&lt;/strong&gt;, requiring us to maintain clarity, objectivity, and discipline. Through recording and review, we can systematically examine the decision-making process, avoiding emotional pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, the sharp drop in US equities on Friday last week, and concerns regarding a potential “trade war 2.0,” have now settled as the market opened this Monday – essentially a “false alarm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;index-funds-executing-the-plan&#34;&gt;Index Funds: Executing the Plan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially anticipating a significant downturn, I added positions in the沪深300 (Shanghai-Shenzhen Stock Exchange 300) and恒生科技指数 (Hang Seng TECH ETF) through Alipay. However, most of the declines in the trailing market were recovered. Given the relatively small size of the initial capital allocation, I will not make any additional operations for now. Future index fund replenishment strategies will be more conservative and gradual, primarily utilizing fixed-income plus products for asset allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hong-kong-stocks-rapid-response-and-disciplined-trading-to-black-swans&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Stocks: Rapid Response and Disciplined Trading to “Black Swans”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the current Hong Kong stock positions, if further declines persist, we will need to deploy new funds into trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;xiaomi-event-and-cognitive-correction&#34;&gt;Xiaomi Event and Cognitive Correction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Xiaomi experienced a “black swan” event: a fatal car accident involving one of its electric vehicles. My initial cognition was that the volume of traffic accidents is massive, and given the increasing vehicle fleet size for Xiaomi, isolated incidents are a matter of probability. &lt;strong&gt;As long as subsequent investigations rule out design flaws in the vehicle itself, the long-term impact on the stock price should be manageable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, Xiaomi’s decline was significantly greater than that of other stocks in the Hong Seng Technology sector. I missed the initial reaction due to being busy eating and not switching the Futu App interface to the news section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on technical analysis, I selected a range I considered a dense accumulation zone for potential bottoms, placing an order to buy at the next price differential. My plan was likely to wait for tomorrow’s traffic police notification, but unexpectedly, the investigative results were released in the afternoon – the driver involved was suspected of drunk driving and speeding. This news caused the stock price to rebound sharply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;trading-summary-reinforce-discipline&#34;&gt;Trading Summary: Reinforce Discipline
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disciplined Trading:&lt;/strong&gt; This entry was explicitly defined as &lt;strong&gt;short-term speculation (“gambling”).&lt;/strong&gt; Its core objective was to: &lt;strong&gt;If successful, quickly realize profits and exit with minimal risk to lower the average cost of existing holdings; If unsuccessful, decisively cut losses and exit.&lt;/strong&gt; The original plan was to fulfill it today or tomorrow, ultimately completed within today’s market rebound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at previous trades: Compared to the initial capital planning, the position is now nearing full allocation. Reviewing Meituan and Xiaomi transactions from half a month ago, we found that several previous &lt;strong&gt;short-term purchases followed by declines, failing to timely cut losses and instead irrationally holding onto hopes of recouping losses&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a significant problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;The biggest progress in this trading was: being able to “not greedily chase profits” with short-term positions; strictly adhering to the trading plan, without blindly adding to positions at unsuitable times.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;transaction-fees-for-short-term-trading&#34;&gt;Transaction Fees for Short-Term Trading
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, during the development of brokerage systems, I had extensively researched transaction fees but never carefully considered their impact from a trader’s perspective. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until today, when conducting a standard T+0 turnaround trade, that I deliberately calculated the returns and clearly realized that &lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong stamp duty&lt;/strong&gt; (one-tenth of the transaction amount) is the largest component of trading costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, my career began in developing brokerage systems for Hong Kong and US stocks. I deeply understood the importance of transaction fees within the system, but lacked firsthand experience as a trader regarding whether they were &lt;strong&gt;more or less&lt;/strong&gt;, nor did I ever delve into how the &lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX)&lt;/strong&gt; generated profits as a listed company. When opening HKGS (Hong Kong Gold Shares) at the beginning of the year, my investment goals remained focused on the Hang Seng Tech Index without considering buying shares in HKEX itself. This mindset resembled a stubborn “wherever I fall, I’ll stand up” attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been proven that &lt;strong&gt;limited knowledge framed the initial investment choices.&lt;/strong&gt; Considering that the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, both under the China Securities Regulatory Commission, are not listed companies, I had actually considered similar industries – domestic brokerage firms. Choosing a brokerage firm was primarily guided by the media narrative of “market makers,” but if comparisons were made, &lt;strong&gt;exchanges&lt;/strong&gt; as market infrastructure have inherent scarcity and monopoly characteristics, undoubtedly making them a better choice than brokerages.&lt;/p&gt;
