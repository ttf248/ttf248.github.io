        <title>Cursor AI programming IDE trial</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Another year has gone by. The biggest change at work is the noticeably increased involvement of AI. Previously, switching between different development languages required developers to be familiar with various languages&amp;rsquo; distinct APIs. Now, these basic codes can all be generated through AI, which is a great boon for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chatgpt&#34;&gt;ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2023, I revised two simple introductory articles. Now it&amp;rsquo;s 2025, and honestly, I haven’t perceived any significant progress. It still requires developing your own understanding, being able to reasonably break down tasks, and most importantly, identifying whether there are bugs in the AI-generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-copilot&#34;&gt;Github copilot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I forgot what day it is, but I saw in the documentation that Singapore deployed servers. For domestic use, we no longer need to constantly use a VPN. Of course, you still need a VPN to log in, but this VPN only needs to be used once for login and can then be turned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Github Copilot more often on a daily basis; this plugin can be used directly in VS Code and Visual Studio, without switching between the two programs. Compared to ChatGPT, Github Copilot offers better project support and a friendlier interaction. You can choose parts of local files to &amp;ldquo;train&amp;rdquo; the AI, so the generated code is more aligned with your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cursor-ai&#34;&gt;Cursor AI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently saw a new AI programming IDE, Cursor AI. This IDE is also based on GitHub Copilot, but this IDE is even more intelligent and can help you create files directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried it briefly, and it feels pretty good, but my understanding of the existing project is still not enough. When there are many local project files, large refactoring and optimization adjustments still require &lt;strong&gt;developers to break down tasks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example: Switch to curso’s engineering mode, enter the following content: Create a personal resume webpage that supports switching between multiple different styles. Remember to fill in some personal information for data display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few back-and-forths, you can obtain the following webpage. Of course, this webpage is still relatively simple, but it&amp;rsquo;s quite good for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, registered users can enjoy 150 free trials of the advanced API, while paying users are limited to 5000 calls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
