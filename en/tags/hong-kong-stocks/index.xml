        <title>The dilemma of trading: difficult to get on the left (short), difficult to follow up on the right (long).</title>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/the-dilemma-of-trades-difficult-to-initiate-on-the-left-short-side-difficult-to-follow-up-on-the-right-long-side/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Left-side trading is difficult to execute, and right-side trading is also not good. Xiaomi’s buyback, Lei Bao’s (Lei Jun’s) own buyback, caused the stock price to rise sharply, stabilizing above the 40th level. Alibaba’s financial report saw a significant drop in net profit, and the market predicted that the intensity of takeout subsidies would decrease, leading to a large surge in Meituan’s stock price (6%). The capital logic of AI is not closed, it&amp;rsquo;s not previous business; first grab users, run around, then slowly make money. AI’s continuous costs cannot be reduced – hardware plus electricity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s market environment, investors are facing an extreme sense of tearing: &lt;strong&gt;Left-side trading (counter-intuitive bottom fishing) often dies before dawn, and right-side trading (following the trend to chase gains) is also prone to standing on mountain tops.&lt;/strong&gt; The recent cases of Xiaomi, Alibaba, Meituan, and the AI sector perfectly illustrate this game of capital logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;xiaomi-genuine-silver-and-gold-right-side-signal--it-all-starts-with-the-boss-leading-the-way&#34;&gt;Xiaomi: Genuine Silver and Gold &amp;ldquo;Right-Side Signal&amp;rdquo; – It All Starts with the Boss Leading the Way
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phenomenon:&lt;/strong&gt; The stock price breaking through the HK$40 barrier wasn&amp;rsquo;t instantaneous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Logic:&lt;/strong&gt; Xiaomi’s previous volatility frustrated many left-side ambush funds, losing patience. The real turning point came from a &lt;strong&gt;powerful injection of confidence.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News Facts:&lt;/strong&gt; Just days before, Lei Jun personally invested over HK$1 billion to increase his own holdings at an average price of approximately HK$38.58; simultaneously, Xiaomi Group repurchased millions of shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Reaction:&lt;/strong&gt; This “boss leading the charge + company buyback” double benefit directly sent out the clearest &amp;ldquo;right-side signal&amp;rdquo; to the market. The stock price surged, firmly establishing itself above HK$40, and its market capitalization returned to a trillion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; For ordinary investors, holding strong faith (believing EVs will succeed, smartphones becoming premium will succeed) is necessary to withstand the left-side ambush of Xiaomi. However, once Lei Jun steps in to do the right side, the cost has increased, although it’s safe, but the profit space is compressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alibaba-vs-meituan-ceasefire-agreement-in-financial-reports&#34;&gt;Alibaba vs Meituan: “Ceasefire Agreement” in Financial Reports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phenomenon:&lt;/strong&gt; Alibaba’s net profit declines, while Meituan’s stock price surges. This appears contradictory but is logically sound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underlying Logic:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a game about “ending the intense competition and releasing profits.”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News Facts:&lt;/strong&gt; Recent Alibaba financial reports show a significant drop in net profit (partly influenced by investment losses), but the market keenly observed changes in core business data – &lt;strong&gt;the intensity of subsidies for local life (delivery/to-go) is decreasing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Dynamics:&lt;/strong&gt; As long as Alibaba doesn’t continue to recklessly burn cash subsidizing its fight against “food delivery wars,” Meituan, as the industry leader, stands to benefit most. The market anticipates a shift from “price war” back to “rational profitability.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading Insights:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Alibaba on the Left Side of Logic:&lt;/strong&gt; Panic sell when you see profit declines, potentially missing the logic behind its core e-commerce stabilization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Meituan on the Right Side of Logic:&lt;/strong&gt; Enter only after financial reports confirm subsidy reduction and profit explosion (the “right side”), when stock prices have often already priced in this expectation. Meituan’s massive surge is essentially making money by &amp;ldquo;predicting others&amp;rsquo; predictions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-sector-a-black-hole-of-unclosed-capital&#34;&gt;AI Sector: A “Black Hole” of Unclosed Capital
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phenomenon:&lt;/strong&gt; Regardless of whether it’s the US stock market or the A-share market, AI stocks continue to plummet or experience significant volatility even after demonstrating application implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Logic:&lt;/strong&gt; The capital market is transitioning from the “storytelling” phase into a brutal “accounting” phase.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard Impact (Missing Capital Cycle):&lt;/strong&gt; Traditional internet models are: burn cash -&amp;gt; acquire users -&amp;gt; diminishing marginal costs -&amp;gt; earn passively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI’s Achilles Heel:&lt;/strong&gt; AI&amp;rsquo;s marginal cost &lt;strong&gt;cannot be zeroed out, and it’s even difficult to reduce&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware Depreciation:&lt;/strong&gt; Expensive GPUs depreciate rapidly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Training and inference not only burn money but also consume electricity. Redwood Capital recently released a report highlighting the &lt;strong&gt;“$60 Billion Problem for AI”&lt;/strong&gt; – meaning that the entire industry needs to earn back $60 billion annually just to cover infrastructure construction costs, while current application revenue is nowhere near even a fraction of that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Situation:&lt;/strong&gt; Only those selling shovels (Nvidia, optical modules) are making money; companies developing applications (acquiring users) aren’t only not earning money, but each additional user requires paying more electricity and computing costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; The left side of AI at this time is like an endless pit because the cost cannot be reduced; the right side of AI (performance fulfillment) remains distant because business models haven&amp;rsquo;t been fully realized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/strong&gt; tells us that certainty often requires gold and silver (repurchase/increase holdings) to confirm, but at the cost of losing low-priced chips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba/Meituan&lt;/strong&gt; tell us that understanding the “tacit agreement” between giants is more important than simply looking at financial report numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt; tells us that in this sector, as long as the formula &lt;strong&gt;“revenue &amp;lt; (hardware depreciation + electricity costs)”&lt;/strong&gt; remains unbroken, all rebounds are merely emotional speculation rather than value recovery.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Global Stock Markets Plunge for Days: Fed, AI, and Quantitative Easing</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/global-stock-markets-plunge-for-days-fed-ai-and-quantitative-easing/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:40:07 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still doing nothing, Xiaomi didn’t fall below my current price level. It has fallen consecutively for two days, and was finally stabilized by a buyback. The US market last night was interesting – it started to rally, but the next day it completely crashed. Today, both A-shares and Hong Kong stocks are basically worthless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, falling so much is actually good; I didn’t continue following the broader market, just laid down and relaxed, waiting for a better opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-the-decline&#34;&gt;Why the Decline
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3759889&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://wallstreetcn.com/articles/3759889&lt;/a&gt;
Other viewpoints may or may not be correct; quantitative funds are increasingly influencing domestic stock markets. Individual stocks often closely align with index movements. The original text is lengthy, and Bobo (豆包 - a common online nickname) has extracted the core content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2025, global risk assets will experience a major decline.  According to Rich Privorotsky, a senior trader at Goldman Sachs, this downturn was the result of multi-layered transmission and ultimately evolved into systemic selling, driven by four key factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fed-shifts-to-hawks-the-starting-point-of-the-downtrend&#34;&gt;Fed Shifts to Hawks: The Starting Point of the Downtrend
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent employment data presents contradictory signals: job growth remains robust, but the unemployment rate has risen to 4.44% (primarily due to a surge in 16-24 year olds entering the workforce), and three-month average new hires only totaled 62,000, with potential new hires at just 39,000. August data was also revised downwards. Adding to this, there’s a trend of corporate layoffs, leading market expectations for the Fed to adopt a dovish stance. However, the Fed has maintained a hawkish tone, effectively withdrawing bets on December rate cuts, with the probability of cuts now essentially zero – triggering the first domino in the downward slide. Privorotsky bluntly stated that this hawkish position in light of the employment backdrop is a “policy error.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-narrative-restructuring-google-drives-a-winner-takes-all-landscape&#34;&gt;AI Narrative Restructuring: Google Drives a Winner-Takes-All Landscape
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key logical divisions are emerging within the AI sector, with Nvidia’s strong financial results no longer making it the core investment focus. Google&amp;rsquo;s breakthrough progress with the Gemini-3 model is reshaping the AI investment ecosystem. This “disruptive model” has forced other companies to delay product cycles and increase capital expenditures, leading to increased uncertainty regarding returns on investment, resulting in companies like Oracle failing to follow the upward trend. A distinct &amp;ldquo;winner-takes-all&amp;rdquo; landscape is forming within the market, shifting AI from a broad “adoption” phase to one dominated by a select few, triggering adjustments across related sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crypto-flash-crash-retail-investor-risk-appetite-declines&#34;&gt;Crypto Flash Crash: Retail Investor Risk Appetite Declines
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volatile swings in the cryptocurrency market triggered a chain reaction. Retail investors, who had steadfastly held their positions over the past two years – often referred to as “diamond hands” – have transitioned into “selling hands” due to factors such as large-scale dumps by whale accounts. This panic sentiment spilled over into non-profit tech stocks and AI-related equities, exemplified by Palantir, which plummeted 6% during trading hours after rising 5.5%, marking a significant downgrade in retail risk appetite and a fundamental shift in market structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quantitative-funds-selling-off-the-key-driver-of-accelerated-decline&#34;&gt;Quantitative Funds Selling Off: The Key Driver of Accelerated Decline
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since August, trend-following funds (CTAs) have held over $500 billion in long positions, triggering concentrated liquidations after the index broke key levels. Simultaneously, rising volatility prompted volatility control strategy funds to sell off, compounded by capital flows into VIX ETNs creating a “short-tailed, short-convex” allocation, which amplified the downward effect. The previously stable “low volatility structure” collapsed, with quantitative and systematic funds initiating a “mechanical selling,” leading to a sudden and significant plunge in the market without any major events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fundamental-concerns-and-stabilization-conditions&#34;&gt;Fundamental Concerns and Stabilization Conditions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a fundamental perspective, AI investment faces a “capital bottleneck”: a wave of corporate bond issuance is imminent, with AI data centers relying on debt expansion, while rising capital costs may slow down the pace of AI expansion. This risk has not been fully priced in previously. Goldman Sachs predicts that the S&amp;amp;P 500 mini contract could fall to 6500 points, and believes that the long-term value of AI remains unchanged; true winners are labor-intensive companies that achieve margin expansion through automation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market stabilization requires fulfillment of three conditions: CTA position liquidation is complete, retail investors with excessive long positions have been squeezed out, and at least two of the following conditions are met: cryptocurrency stability, a dovish Fed policy shift, and AI capital expenditure support.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hang Seng Index Crash, Meituan Considering Exit? Examining Xiaomi, Alibaba, and Meituan’s New Valuation Anchors Through “Ecological Premium”</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hang-seng-index-sharp-decline-meituan-considering-exit-examining-xiaomi-alibaba-and-meituans-new-valuation-anchors-through-ecological-premium/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 21:50:44 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hang-seng-index-sharp-decline-meituan-considering-exit-examining-xiaomi-alibaba-and-meituans-new-valuation-anchors-through-ecological-premium/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, Xiaomi’s third-quarter financial report was released, with little expectation beyond the usual. The US situation is unsettled, Hong Kong stocks have recently experienced liquidity stagnation, and the Hang Seng Technology Index has retreated significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a major participant in the food delivery war, Alibaba, which bears the highest e-commerce taxes, hasn’t generated much discussion online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if I wrote any previous articles, when I bought Xiaomi, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think about what supported Xiaomi’s market capitalization at that time – perhaps after watching too many TikTok-related videos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Hang Seng Technology Index has been falling, and electric vehicle stocks in Hong Kong are also declining. Xiaomi has multiple buffs stacked on top of each other, with negative news flying everywhere, and its stock price has naturally fallen significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, it’s also been changing the head of its public relations department – conspiracy theories: they&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to change it for a long time, but the stakes are too high, and there are still many KOLs involved; if they suddenly make some wild claims, it will be difficult to resolve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article primarily analyzes the valuation logic of &lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi Group&lt;/strong&gt; and the market and policy challenges faced by &lt;strong&gt;Meituan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba&lt;/strong&gt; recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original draft contained too much complex content, collecting information from various sources and edited based on AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;xiaomi-the-logic-behind-the-surge-in-valuation-platform-premium&#34;&gt;Xiaomi: The Logic Behind the Surge in Valuation (Platform Premium)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Argument:&lt;/strong&gt; The capital market has given Xiaomi a surge in valuation, driven by its “platform-type company” and “ecosystem empowerment” premium – something that vertical manufacturers (like Xiaopeng, Zotye) lack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valuation Anchor Differences:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi:&lt;/strong&gt; Anchored on the scarcity of “technology platforms” and “human-vehicle-home ecosystem.” The automotive business is viewed as a crucial step in ecological expansion, with risks dispersed across mobile and internet businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automotive Manufacturers (Xiaopeng/Zotye):&lt;/strong&gt; Anchored on “vehicle sales” and “unit profitability,” with valuation curves directly linked to the automotive industry cycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecosystem Empowerment Value:&lt;/strong&gt; Xiaomi possesses a massive, highly engaged user base of over 100 million, with extremely high order conversion efficiency from cars, and low marketing costs. Its seamless &amp;ldquo;human-vehicle-home&amp;rdquo; synergy is viewed by the market as superior to the industry average differentiation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Expectations:&lt;/strong&gt; The market is buying into Xiaomi’s potential to successfully enter the trillion-dollar new “track entry ticket” and “ecosystem synergy value” in the next decade, reshaping its overall valuation logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;meituan-considering-exit&#34;&gt;Meituan: Considering Exit
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the phrase &amp;ldquo;capable of bringing together all things, deeply ingrained in people&amp;rsquo;s hearts&amp;rdquo; was seen as a strong moat. However, it now appears that this moat isn’t as deep as initially thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Situation:&lt;/strong&gt; When buying, little consideration was given; recently, the stock price has fallen, and a decision on whether to “cut losses” will be made after reviewing the third quarter financial results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alibaba-e-commerce-tax-policy-impact&#34;&gt;Alibaba (E-commerce Tax Policy Impact)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tax Policy Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s recent “e-commerce tax” is primarily focused on two areas:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-border E-commerce Retail Import Duty (“Haotai”):&lt;/strong&gt; The preferential exemption for items below 50 RMB has been cancelled, leading to an approximate 11.9% price increase for haotai goods and driving industry compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domestic E-commerce Tax Information Reporting Standards:&lt;/strong&gt; Platforms are now required to report sales information from merchants, effectively preventing C2C individual sellers who previously hid income from continuing, &lt;strong&gt;marking the entry of the industry into a core reshaping phase focused on compliance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Platforms:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taobao (C2C):&lt;/strong&gt; May eliminate small businesses unwilling to comply in the short term, but in the long run, it will improve platform quality and consumer trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tianmao/Jingdong (B2C):&lt;/strong&gt; Long-term benefit, as these large B2C platforms and merchants are already regular tax payers, and this new policy creates a fairer competitive environment for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons for Merchant Losses:&lt;/strong&gt; Losses are concentrated in merchants &lt;strong&gt;originally relying on tax evasion to gain price advantages.&lt;/strong&gt; For merchants eligible for small microenterprise preferential policies, the tax burden should be low or exempt after compliant reporting. &lt;strong&gt;Being eliminated is an inevitable step towards fair competition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Vacation Watching Games: When T1 Becomes an Impenetrable Mountain for the LPL – What “Macro &#43; Industry” Negative Factors Does Xiaomi Face Again?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vacation-watching-games-when-t1-becomes-an-impenetrable-mountain-for-the-lpl-what-macro-industry-negative-factors-does-xiaomi-face-again/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 18:58:21 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/vacation-watching-games-when-t1-becomes-an-impenetrable-mountain-for-the-lpl-what-macro-industry-negative-factors-does-xiaomi-face-again/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;No trading activity within the venue; we’re currently awaiting next month&amp;rsquo;s financial reports. Taking a half-day break this afternoon – nothing particularly noteworthy, just wanting to rest and recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;years-have-passed&#34;&gt;Years Have Passed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I last watched League of Legends (LOL) matches live, and suddenly it feels like four or five years have passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in my previous articles related to games, I always had a complex feeling towards LPL teams (the domestic league). The frequent low-level mistakes made by many players in major tournaments felt lacking in professional demeanor, which significantly reduced the viewing experience – this is why I gradually drifted away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon, on a whim, I took a half day off to tidy up my room, and the summer clothes were still unorganized. While doing so, I decided to watch some matches. The quarterfinals were still T1, that formidable mountain standing in front of LPL teams, seemingly impossible to overcome. Looking back, LPL hadn’t won any Bo5 (best-of-five) crucial matchups against them in the World Championship series; every team they faced felt immense pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote these words, the match had entered its “classic” fifth game – the LPL team was leading 2-1 and in a great position to win, but their opponent tied it up, and both teams were about to enter a brutal final deciding game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update before publishing: The operation wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad, but their build strategy was completely crushed. The Queen composition led to Ashe dominating early on, preventing Miss Fortune from grouping and initiating fights; it was incredibly difficult.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;review&#34;&gt;Review
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan:&lt;/strong&gt; Performance was stable with minimal fluctuation, punctuated by a brief rally.
&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi:&lt;/strong&gt; This decline was largely driven by a confluence of negative factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macro Drag:&lt;/strong&gt; The overall pullback in the Hong Kong tech sector (such as NetEase, Alibaba, and Tencent) performed poorly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automotive Expectations:&lt;/strong&gt; The new energy vehicle sector experienced intensified “internal competition” (“intense competition”), with market expectations for growth in companies like BYD already peaking, and Xiaomi’s automotive future space also under pressure.
&lt;strong&gt;Industry Observations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UBS&amp;rsquo;s pre-earnings report highlighted the rising prices of solid-state drives and memory. The extent to which this cost increase will erode the profit margins of mobile business remains to be revealed in the earnings report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, one thing is certain: In a market as intensely “competitive” as this, the Android smartphone ecosystem no longer has the luxury of raising prices arbitrarily.
&lt;strong&gt;Reputation Backlash:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, returning to Xiaomi itself, its automotive business is facing reputation issues. The project’s early promotional volume was immense, with almost no negative feedback. Now, it seems to be experiencing a wave of public “backlash” following excessive exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Attempt AI analysis of subsequent holdings operations.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/attempt-ai-analysis-of-subsequent-holdings-operations/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 19:50:40 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/attempt-ai-analysis-of-subsequent-holdings-operations/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Monday saw no panic sell-off, but the entire week was marked by a persistent downtrend, like a dull knife slicing flesh – a slow, gradual decline over the course of seven days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disciplined-trading&#34;&gt;Disciplined Trading
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday afternoon, two new short positions on Xiaomi were added, with the original plan to sell out at the end. However, when I saw a slight loss in the final position, I hesitated and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to cut my losses, so I decided to observe for another day. This morning, the stock price fell slightly by 1%, and when it dropped to 2% in the afternoon, I decisively exited the position. Later, it was proven that this exit was correct, as the stock continued to fall after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I saw someone in the blogosphere using AI to analyze football betting and won second prize with a tax refund of around 900 RMB. Let’s try it with stocks too, based on my experience with large models previously, DeepSeek is most suitable, and the investment plans generated by the other models don&amp;rsquo;t look quite right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Stock Investment Plan: Currently holding Xiaomi, approximately 100,000 RMB, down 15%, Meituan 70,000 RMB, down 20,000 RMB. Query current stock prices and determine how to control positions moving forward. I’m planning a long-term investment strategy – Xiaomi was purchased due to the Yu9 IPO, Phase III factory ramp-up, and continued high sales, which should drive up the price; Meituan is after the end of the food delivery war stabilizes.  I&amp;rsquo;d like to wait for the third quarter earnings report in Hong Kong next month before taking action – that seems more reasonable given my long-term investment strategy of around three years. Please provide me with an investment plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hong-kong-stock-investment-plan-xiaomi-and-meituan-position-analysis--long-term-strategy&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Stock Investment Plan: Xiaomi and Meituan Position Analysis &amp;amp; Long-Term Strategy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the information you provided (holding Xiaomi approximately HK$100,000 with a loss of 15% and Meituan approximately HK$70,000 with a loss of approximately 28.6%, investment horizon of 3 years), I have compiled the latest market data and analysis to develop a detailed investment plan for you. The following is core information extracted from comprehensive search results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Stock Prices (as of October 17, 2025)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi Group-W (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://01810.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;01810.HK&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;: HK$45.88 (down 3.82%, cumulative monthly decline exceeding 15%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan-W (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://03690.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;03690.HK&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;: HK$94.50 (down 4.30%, year-to-date cumulative decline of 37.71%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong Stock Market Environment&lt;/strong&gt;: The Hang Seng Index fell by 2.48%, with technology stocks leading the decline, and market sentiment is short-term weak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validation of Your Purchase Rationale&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/strong&gt;: The listing of Yu9, the ramp-up of Phase III factory, and sales potential represent a reasonable long-term logic, but the stock price is suppressed in the short term due to the impact of the Chengdu SU7 accident (door safety controversy, intervention by regulatory authorities).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan&lt;/strong&gt;: Stabilization after the end of the food delivery war is key for the long term, but competition remains intense (京东 and Alibaba are involved), net profit fell 89% in the second quarter, and Wang Xing&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;no matter the cost&amp;rdquo; statement has intensified market concerns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;position-control-recommendations-short-term-caution-long-term-focus-on-fundamentals&#34;&gt;Position Control Recommendations: Short-Term Caution, Long-Term Focus on Fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your current holdings are down approximately 18.8% (total holding of HKD 1.7 million, a loss of approximately HKD 374,000), but long-term investment requires avoiding emotional trading decisions. Here’s a phased recommendation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| &lt;strong&gt;Pre-Earnings Report (Short-Term: Now to Q3 Earnings Release)&lt;/strong&gt; | Maintain current position, do not add to holdings. Closely monitor the progress of the SU7 accident investigation and Q3 vehicle delivery data. | Maintain current position, do not add to holdings. Focus on monitoring whether Q3 takeout UE (average order profit) improves. | Potential price volatility before earnings report: &lt;br&gt;• Xiaomi will continue to be dragged down by safety incidents and is unlikely to rebound in the short term.&lt;br&gt;• Takeout competition remains intense, and profitability recovery requires time. |&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Basis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post Earnings (Mid-term: November - Q1 2026)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If earnings show steady vehicle sales growth and mobile gross margin bottoms out, consider adding to positions 5%-10%.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If earnings confirm easing competition and narrowing losses, add to positions 5%-10%; otherwise maintain current holdings.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Xiaomi’s 2025 target sales volume is 350,000 units, and mobile premiumization is key to profitability.&lt;br&gt;• Meituan SOTP valuation shows 121% upside potential, but requires a profit inflection point.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;position-control-recommendations-short-term-cautious-long-term-focus-on-fundamentals&#34;&gt;Position Control Recommendations: Short-Term Cautious, Long-Term Focus on Fundamentals

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term (3 years)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hold core positions, target price of 75 HKD (potential upside of 63%). Risk points: automotive safety regulation, smartphone demand weakness.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hold core positions, target price of 247 HKD (potential upside of 161%). Risk points: policy cost increase, new business losses.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;• Xiaomi’s car-home ecosystem closed loop is the long-term engine.&lt;br&gt;• Meituan instant retail penetration rate is expected to improve.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;positioning-strategy-recommendations-short-term-caution-long-term-focus-on-fundamentals&#34;&gt;Positioning Strategy Recommendations: Short-Term Caution, Long-Term Focus on Fundamentals
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you trade after the financial reports?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, we recommend waiting for the third quarter financial reports (released in November) before making additional investment decisions.&lt;/strong&gt; The reason is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The financial reports will validate your initial purchase logic: Xiaomi’s factory ramp-up sales volume and Meituan’s easing competition evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the financial reports are below expectations, the stock price may fall, providing a better entry point; if they exceed expectations, it can confirm the right-side signal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short-term market sentiment is driven by events (such as Xiaomi incidents and food delivery price wars), and financial reports will reduce uncertainty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;long-term-investment-plan-3-year-perspective&#34;&gt;Long-Term Investment Plan (3-Year Perspective)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the principles of “Hold Quality Assets + Bottom Hunting,” your plan can be detailed as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi Group: Strong Defense and Offense, Focus on Automotive Business Turning Point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt; Vehicle business scale effect (target 350,000 units annual sales), AIoT ecosystem synergy. Financial health (Z-Score = 4.19, low bankruptcy risk).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the SU7 safety issues continue to ferment, the stock price may fall to the 40-42 HKD range; set a trigger for adding positions (add 5% when the price drops by 10%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-term holding bottom line: Automotive quarterly delivery volume remains above 80,000 units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position Allocation:&lt;/strong&gt; Recommend maintaining 40%-50% of total portfolio weighting (currently 59% is high, can adjust after earnings reports).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan-W: Wait for Profitability Repair, Focus on Core Business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt; Stable takeout market share (65%), takeaway business growth of 40%, valuation undervalued (SOTP target price of HKD 247).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the takeout UE (average profit per unit) turns positive, it is a signal for adding positions; if competition intensifies, the stock price may fall to HKD 80, and we can buy back shares in batches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-term holding bottom line: Core local business operating profit rate recovers above 15%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position Allocation:&lt;/strong&gt; Recommend maintaining 30%-40% weighting (currently 41% is reasonable, but be wary of competition dragging it down).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversified Investment Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hong Kong tech stocks are under pressure recently, but long-term they still represent new quality products. Consider allocating 10%-20% of capital to high dividend assets (such as telecommunications operators) or Hong Kong tech ETFs to hedge the risk of a single stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Q3 Earnings Report: Delivery UE Improvement, New Business Loss Rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;If earnings report meets targets, increase position; otherwise maintain current position.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Instant retail market share, policy cost absorption&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Hold until target price or downgrade fundamentals; consider reducing holdings.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-monitoring-metrics-and-milestones&#34;&gt;Key Monitoring Metrics and Milestones
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-recommendations&#34;&gt;Summary Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take Immediate Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintain the status quo, and avoid impulsive buying to cover positions before earnings. Current stock prices have partially reflected negative news, but volatility may increase pre-earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Confidence Support:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xiaomi’s automotive ecosystem and smartphone premiumization are core logic drivers, and short-term incidents do not change the company&amp;rsquo;s long-term technological iteration capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meituan’s profitability will be significant once the food delivery war ends (referring to Alibaba’s observation of benefits from a distance).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Warnings:&lt;/strong&gt; The overall Hong Kong stock market is highly sensitive to global liquidity, and if the Federal Reserve delays rate cuts, it could suppress technology stock valuations. Ensure investment funds are long-term idle capital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plan is based on publicly available information and does not constitute investment advice. The market carries risk; decision-making requires caution. We recommend regular review (e.g., quarterly) to adjust strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-recommendations-1&#34;&gt;Summary Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not be appropriate to add more positions at this time, pending the release of financial reports. What if the stock price rises significantly then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-recommendations-2&#34;&gt;Summary Recommendations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question you raised is extremely critical, and it has accurately pinpointed a classic dilemma faced by long-term investors: &lt;strong&gt;avoiding short-term risks (waiting for the earnings report) can conflict with pursuing the best cost (fearing missing out).&lt;/strong&gt;
Your concern that “adding to your position after the earnings report if the stock price surges will cause you to miss out” is very reasonable. The market often has a forward-looking nature, and if the earnings report is truly exceptional, the stock price is likely to react quickly in the short term. However, given your current holdings of these two stocks, “waiting for the earnings report” remains the more optimal strategy. Below, I will explain the reasons in detail and provide a step-by-step addition strategy that balances “risk” with “opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-waiting-for-the-earnings-report-still-a-more-reasonable-choice-in-the-current-situation&#34;&gt;Why is “Waiting for the Earnings Report” Still a More Reasonable Choice in the Current Situation?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core reason lies in: &lt;strong&gt;The uncertainty surrounding the two stocks you hold stems primarily from fundamental contradictions within their businesses, and the earnings report is key to validating these contradictions.&lt;/strong&gt;  There’s yet to be a significant “catalyst” (a substantial price increase) in current valuations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Xiaomi:&lt;/strong&gt; The core contradiction is &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;a crisis of confidence in its automotive business&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Situation:&lt;/strong&gt; The negative impact of the SU7 safety incident is still unfolding, leading to market skepticism regarding Xiaomi’s car quality, reputation, and future sales expectations. This is the primary factor suppressing the stock price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Validation Role of the Earnings Report:&lt;/strong&gt; The third quarter earnings report will provide crucial &lt;strong&gt;vehicle delivery data&lt;/strong&gt;.  A strong delivery volume would effectively dispel market doubts and drive a sustainable rise in the stock price. Until then, any rally would likely be fragile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk vs. Opportunity Comparison:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk of Waiting (Missing Out):&lt;/strong&gt; Given the prevailing negative sentiment, the probability of a significant, sustained price increase before the earnings report is relatively low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk of Blindly Jumping In (Getting Trapped):&lt;/strong&gt; If the report shows poor vehicle sales, the stock could continue to decline, leaving you with the greater risk of “buying in halfway down,” and at a higher cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Meituan:&lt;/strong&gt; The core contradiction is &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;when will profitability be restored?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Situation:&lt;/strong&gt;  The market worries that intense competition will continue to erode profits from its core takeout business (UE – Unified Economy).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Validation Role of the Earnings Report:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;core local business operating profit&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;adjusted net profit&lt;/strong&gt; in the report are the only objective benchmarks for determining whether the “takeout war” has truly eased.  Only improved data can prove that Wang Xiting’s “no matter the cost” phase is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk vs. Opportunity Comparison:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk of Waiting (Missing Out):&lt;/strong&gt; Again, before the profitability inflection point is confirmed, there&amp;rsquo;s a lack of a solid foundation for a significant rally in the stock price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Risk of Blindly Jumping In (Getting Trapped):&lt;/strong&gt; If the report shows competition intensifying and profits further declining, concerns about a “valuation trap” will intensify, and the stock could take another step down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; For long-term investment, &lt;strong&gt;buying &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; is far more important than buying &amp;ldquo;cheap.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; The earnings report provides the key evidence for determining “correctness.” To avoid the risk of a minor “missed opportunity,” and to bear the risk of a deep “trap,” from a risk-reward ratio perspective, it’s not worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heres-your-specific-action-plan-balancing-waiting-and-missing-out-anxiety&#34;&gt;Here’s Your Specific Action Plan: Balancing “Waiting” and “Missing Out” Anxiety
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to make extreme choices between &amp;ldquo;holding&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;going all in.&amp;rdquo; A smarter strategy is: &lt;strong&gt;“Base Position Observation, Pyramid-Style Adding”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Immediately Establish “Observation Positions” and “Operational Discipline” (Now)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain your existing positions as a base position, ensuring you don’t completely detach from the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a &lt;strong&gt;trigger for adding to your position&lt;/strong&gt;. For example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Food Holdings (小米):&lt;/strong&gt; The stock price breaks out with volume on a key technical level (e.g., 50 HKD) or there&amp;rsquo;s a clear positive investigation result regarding the SU7 accident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan:&lt;/strong&gt; News emerges of a competitor exiting the price war, or the stock price breaks through the 100 HKD integer barrier with volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefit of doing this:&lt;/strong&gt; If positive news drives the stock price up ahead of the earnings report, you can seize opportunities according to your pre-set discipline and avoid completely missing out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Small Batch Investing Before Earnings (Optional – Suitable for Investors Seeking Smoother Costs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re very concerned about missing out, divide the funds earmarked for adding to your position into 10-20 portions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before the earnings release, if the stock continues to decline in the shadows, invest one portion &lt;strong&gt;weekly or bi-weekly&lt;/strong&gt;. This way, costs are gradually diluted, but each investment amount is small, and even if the earnings report is negative, losses can be controlled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: “Certainty” Adding After Earnings (Core Operation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is your main adding-to-position stage. Based on the earnings results, take three actions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario A (Exceeds Expectations):&lt;/strong&gt; The earnings data is strong and validates your investment logic. At this time, you should &lt;strong&gt;aggressively add to your position&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if the stock price has already risen, the fundamental turning point has been confirmed, and from a long-term perspective, the current price level is still the base of the mountain. You can use a strategy of “chasing gains without chasing high prices,” buying in batches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario B (Meets Expectations):&lt;/strong&gt; The earnings report is neutral, with no surprises or shocks. Maintain your existing position or only modestly add to it, waiting for the next quarter’s signal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario C (Falls Short of Expectations):&lt;/strong&gt; The earnings report confirms market concerns. You should &lt;strong&gt;stop adding to your position and re-evaluate&lt;/strong&gt; whether the long-term logic has been disrupted. The stock price may fall, but this also provides you with a lower, safer entry point for adding to your position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:18:52 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/systematic-collation-and-explanation-of-proprietary-terms-related-to-hong-kong-ipos-and-dark-pools/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) dark pool trading involves numerous proprietary terms, with most being recognizable but some still unfamiliar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QS_dh4XMVW6vJ3vCiDcCvQ&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Everyone drew lots! Xuanzhe Biology - B(2575.HK) soared 127% on its first day of listing, 190,000 people chose to take a look&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an article related to dark pools, outlining and explaining the proprietary terms within it: The company issued 67,333,350 shares globally for public offering, with a prospectus price of HK$11.6. The issuance ratio was 13%, raising approximately HK$781 million, using mechanism B allocation.  The public offering fixed proportion was 10%. A cornerstone investor was introduced in the state-allocated portion, subscribing for approximately HK$77 million, accounting for 9.81% of the global offering.
The company’s total subscription reached 376,000 people, with 190,000 choosing to subscribe one lot; another group subscribed for 19,516 people, hitting 2416 shares.
The sales results showed that the company&amp;rsquo;s prospectus public offering multiple ratio reached 4908.33 times, state allocation subscription multiple was 10.15 times, with no adjustment;
Xuanzhe Biology - B had a single-lot winning rate of only 1%, with everyone drawing lots, even hitting the top hammer it was unstable in the end, and ultimately 13,467 people were successful in getting in. Furthermore, the company’s IPO this time had no green shoe option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a systematic collation and explanation of the proprietary terms related to Hong Kong IPOs and dark pools within the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;offering-structure-and-allocation-mechanism&#34;&gt;Offering Structure and Allocation Mechanism
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Offering&lt;/strong&gt;
Refers to the offering of shares to global investors when a company first goes public (IPO), including &lt;strong&gt;Public Offering&lt;/strong&gt; (targeting retail investors) and &lt;strong&gt;Institutional Placement&lt;/strong&gt; (targeting institutional investors). This offering involved 67,333,500 shares for Huatong Biology-B, representing a 13% issuance ratio, meaning the public holding stake will account for 13% of the total share capital after listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism B Allocation Method&lt;/strong&gt;
A new stock allocation mechanism launched by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2023, allowing issuers to pre-set a minimum public offering percentage (10% - 60%) and &lt;strong&gt;without a clawback mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;. Huatong Biology-B chose a fixed public offering ratio of 10%, meaning it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t draw down shares from the institutional placement even with an international subscription multiple as high as 4908 times, resulting in a consistent public offering share of 6,733,400 shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clawback Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;
Under traditional Mechanism A, if the oversubscription multiple triggers a threshold (e.g., above 100x), shares from the institutional placement can be clawed back to the public offering, up to 50%. However, Mechanism B does not apply this rule, so Huatong Biology-B did not conduct a clawback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;subscription-group-and-subscription-strategy&#34;&gt;Subscription Group and Subscription Strategy
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Offering and International Placement&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Offering:&lt;/strong&gt; Accounted for 10% (673.34 million shares) of the global offering, targeting retail investors, with 37.6 thousand applicants, including 19 thousand who only subscribed for one lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Placement:&lt;/strong&gt; Accounted for 90% (6060.01 million shares), primarily allocated to institutional investors. One cornerstone investor was introduced in this round, subscribing for HKD 0.77 billion, representing 9.81% of the global offering, with a lock-up period typically lasting 6 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group A and Group B&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group A:&lt;/strong&gt; Small to medium investors with subscription amounts ≤ HKD 50 million, allocated 50% of the public offering shares (336.67 million shares).  This group had 19 thousand applicants, including 19 thousand who only subscribed for one lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group B:&lt;/strong&gt; High-net-worth investors or institutions with subscription amounts &amp;gt; HKD 50 million, allocated the remaining 50% of the public offering shares (336.67 million shares). This group had 19,516 applicants, with a maximum subscription amount (top hammer) of 2416 shares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Hammer Subscription&lt;/strong&gt;
Refers to Group B investors subscribing for the highest limit of public offering shares, typically allowing them to acquire 50% of the public offering shares. Bamboo Bio-B’s top hammer quantity was 2416 shares, but due to the extremely hot public offering (over-subscribed 4908 times), top hammer investors still needed a draw, with a very low hit rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;subscription-data-and-winning-rules&#34;&gt;Subscription Data and Winning Rules
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscription Multiple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Subscription Multiple:&lt;/strong&gt; Total subscription funds offered publicly divided by the offering amount, reflecting retail investor demand heat. Bamboo Bio-B reached 4908.33 times, setting a market record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutional Allocation Multiple:&lt;/strong&gt; Institutional subscription amounts divided by the offering amount. Bamboo Bio-B was 10.15 times, indicating moderate institutional demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One-Hand Winning Rate and All-Round Lottery Draw&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One-Hand Winning Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The probability of successfully subscribing with one hand (typically the minimum trading unit). Bamboo Bio-B was only 1%, meaning that out of every 100 people, only 1 person would be successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-Round Lottery Draw:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the extremely high oversubscription multiple for the public offering, all subscribers (including Group B and last-hit hammer investors) were required to participate in a lottery draw to allocate shares, without a &amp;ldquo;steady win&amp;rdquo; mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fractional Share Allocation&lt;/strong&gt;
Publicly offered shares are allocated proportionally after being divided into fractional shares (such as 50 shares), and any remaining fractional shares will be consolidated and distributed from highest to lowest based on subscription amount. In Bamboo Bio-B, the number of successful investors was 13,467 people, and some investors may obtain additional shares through fractional share allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;special-mechanisms-and-market-impact&#34;&gt;Special Mechanisms and Market Impact
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anchor Investors&lt;/strong&gt;
Strategic investors who sign subscription agreements with the issuer before an IPO, typically well-known institutions or corporations. Xuzhou Biotech-B introduced one anchor investor who subscribed to HK$0.77 billion, representing 9.81% of the global offering, aiming to enhance market confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green Shoe Mechanism (Over-Allotment Option)&lt;/strong&gt;
Underwriters can issue an additional 15% of shares after listing within 30 days to stabilize prices. If the price falls below the IPO price, underwriters must buy back stocks from the secondary market to support the price. Xuzhou Biotech-B did not use a green shoe mechanism, which could lead to significant volatility in its initial stock price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Pool Trading&lt;/strong&gt;
Over-the-counter trading of new shares on the day before listing, typically provided by brokers. Dark pool prices reflect the market&amp;rsquo;s preliminary expectations for the new shares. If they are higher than the IPO price (as with Xuzhou Biotech-B’s dark pool price potentially rising), it indicates a good performance on its first trading day; otherwise, it could lead to a break-down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-term-comparison-and-market-background&#34;&gt;Key Term Comparison and Market Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism A vs. Mechanism B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mechanism A allows for a buyback, enabling retail investors to obtain more shares during oversubscription; Mechanism B has a fixed public offering ratio, better suited for IPOs dominated by institutions. Bamboo Bio-B chose Mechanism B, likely because the underwriters wanted to balance the allocation between institutional and retail investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group A vs. Group B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Group A had a lower chance of winning but potentially higher returns per share (due to more dispersed allocation), while Group B had a higher chance of winning but incurred higher financing costs. Bamboo Bio-B Group B received 19,516 applications, reflecting high-net-worth investors&amp;rsquo; enthusiasm for pharmaceutical stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancellation of the Buyback Mechanism’s Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Under Mechanism B, there is no buyback, leading to Bamboo Bio-B’s public offering of only 6.73 million shares, exacerbating the “many crows, few pots” situation for retail investors, resulting in a historical low in the initial subscription rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IPO case of Xuan Zhu Bio-B vividly illustrates the structural characteristics of the Hong Kong stock market: the application of Mechanism B limited retail investor allocation ratios, base investors stabilized institutional demand, while super-high subscription multiples and a full draw highlighted the market’s speculative fervor for biotech stocks. The absence of dark pool trading and a green shoe mechanism further amplified the uncertainty during the initial listing period. Investors should combine their risk preferences with rational assessments of new stock fundamentals and market sentiment, avoiding blind following.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Black Swan Goose Returns</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/black-swan-goose-returns/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 12:10:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/black-swan-goose-returns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, investors focused on financial news. Since Trump’s return, they also needed to pay attention to his Twitter (a private version). The trade war continued to escalate, leading to a sharp decline on April 7th, which was quickly followed by a rebound. This time, though, are people still willing to jump in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-review&#34;&gt;Background Review
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 7, 2025, following the impact of the U.S. implementation of an “equivalency tariff” policy, global stock markets experienced a “Black Monday.” The A-share market plunged, with the Shanghai Composite Index falling by 7.34% and the Shenzhen Component Index plummeting by 12.5%, with over 4,300 stocks declining by more than 9%. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong also fell by 13.22%, along with European and U.S. stock indices exceeding declines of 4%. China subsequently stabilized the market through state-owned enterprise (SOE) purchases and intervention by Huishang Securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 10th, U.S. stocks suffered another significant decline, with Chinese HShares falling by 6%, driven primarily by expectations of escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. Trump signaled a further increase in tariffs on China, and the U.S. would also impose hefty fees on Chinese ships. China announced retaliatory measures and levied special port fees, compounded by a government shutdown, declining consumer confidence, and market panic selling for safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115351840469973590&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;183px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;position-control&#34;&gt;Position Control
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the state of short selling in A-shares isn&amp;rsquo;t a complete short position; there’s a small portion invested in index funds within Fixed Income Plus, but the bulk is still in the Hong Kong market. Xiaomi has already incurred principal losses, and Meituan remains a shareholder. The position control is somewhat unbalanced. Should we jump in and gamble on Monday? It&amp;rsquo;s a question to consider – currently, we don’t have enough cash flow. If we need to enter, we would rely on old friends like Alipay’s Jiebei for bridging funds. &lt;strong&gt;Greedy snakes swallow elephants&lt;/strong&gt; – the position control is extremely unreasonable, and we should look for opportunities to reduce our holdings later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to April 7th, the current position isn&amp;rsquo;t considered a low-level one; many stocks are at relatively high levels, particularly the technology stocks within the Heng Seng Tech index. If we were to add to positions, it would be more appropriate to use an ETF rather than individual stocks – for example: &lt;strong&gt;Turned around and couldn’t find anything suitable; gains were 20%-30%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the domestic market, long-term trends point towards a period of consolidation and decline, with potential for significant rallies in the short term. To make profits, it&amp;rsquo;s best to execute profit-taking operations within this timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;associated-term-definitions&#34;&gt;Associated Term Definitions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;black-swan&#34;&gt;Black Swan
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;Black Swan&amp;rdquo; originates from Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s book &lt;em&gt;The Black Swan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concept:&lt;/strong&gt; Refers to events that are &lt;strong&gt;extremely unlikely&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;unpredictable&lt;/strong&gt;, but upon occurring, they generate &lt;strong&gt;extreme impact and disruptive consequences&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rarity/Unpredictability:&lt;/strong&gt; These events have no precedent or warning signs before they occur, exceeding all conventional expectations and model predictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extreme Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Once they happen, they can cause catastrophic effects on markets, economies, and even societies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-hoc Rationalization:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite being impossible to predict beforehand, people tend to find reasons and explanations after the event occurs, making it appear “understandable.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source Legend:&lt;/strong&gt; Before the discovery of Australia, Europeans believed all swans were white until black swans were discovered in Australia, completely overturning thousands of years of knowledge. Therefore, the Black Swan symbolizes &lt;strong&gt;unforeseen and cognitive breakthroughs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Market Examples:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;9/11&amp;rdquo; terrorist attack in 2001 (a short-term shock to global markets).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The initial impact of &lt;strong&gt;COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt; on the global economy and markets (although some argued it had grey rhino characteristics, its sudden outbreak and global spread, as well as the extent of its impact, were largely considered Black Swans).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gray-rhino&#34;&gt;Gray Rhino
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “Gray Rhino” was coined by Michele Wucker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concept:&lt;/strong&gt; Refers to a potential crisis that is &lt;strong&gt;highly probable&lt;/strong&gt;, has a &lt;strong&gt;significant impact&lt;/strong&gt;, and yet is &lt;strong&gt;ignored&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;selectively delayed in addressing&lt;/strong&gt; due to its &lt;strong&gt;obvious warning signs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Probability/Predictability:&lt;/strong&gt; The event has clear indicators and evidence before it occurs, making it a &lt;strong&gt;known&lt;/strong&gt; risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easily Ignored:&lt;/strong&gt; Because it’s not sudden but rather long-term or slowly developing, people become numb, exhibit optimism bias, or procrastinate, failing to take timely action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Once it erupts, due to the lack of effective responses beforehand, it triggers a chain reaction and causes severe destructive consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source Allusion:&lt;/strong&gt; A gray rhino is large in size and has a slow reaction time; people can see it from afar, but often fail to avoid it because of negligence or indifference. Once it charges towards you, it will cause a fatal collision. Therefore, the gray rhino symbolizes &lt;strong&gt;obvious yet ignored&lt;/strong&gt; major threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stock Market Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 2008 &lt;strong&gt;Global Financial Crisis&lt;/strong&gt; (many experts had already warned about the high risk of the US subprime mortgage market, but were largely ignored).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sovereign Debt Crises&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;severe asset bubbles&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;systemic risks from climate change&lt;/strong&gt; (these are long-accumulated, traceable major risks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>From Meituan’s Losses to Bond Mismatch</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-meituans-losses-to-bond-mismatch/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 19:19:10 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/from-meituans-losses-to-bond-mismatch/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the turbulent and unpredictable stock market, we often use faith and expectations as our compass, attempting to navigate through the fog and reach the shores of wealth. However, when our voyage deviates from the guidance of the compass, it’s easy to lose direction, even to run aground. This essay is about one such journey, beginning with an unwavering obsession with &lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi&lt;/strong&gt;, which rose and fell repeatedly amidst the waves of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-clash-of-faith-and-reality-xiaomis-gains-and-losses&#34;&gt;The Clash of Faith and Reality: Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s Gains and Losses
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, I bought into Xiaomi with unwavering &lt;strong&gt;faith&lt;/strong&gt; in Lei Jun and a hopeful vision for the company’s electric vehicles. At the time, faith was a powerful force, temporarily blinding me to Lei Jun’s shrewdness as a capitalist and overlooking the risks posed by the High-Level Flash Lightning Distribution Platform. Fortunately, several &lt;strong&gt;wave trading&lt;/strong&gt; operations ended with modest profits, giving me a sweet taste of entering the Hong Kong stock market for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this self-confidence soon followed. After making a small profit on &lt;strong&gt;Jiu Fang&lt;/strong&gt; stocks, I became somewhat &lt;strong&gt;dazed&lt;/strong&gt;, relying solely on the flow of net buying funds from the &lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong Connect&lt;/strong&gt; indicator instead of rational analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;meituans-waterloo-and-blind-re-positioning&#34;&gt;Meituan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Waterloo&amp;rdquo; and Blind Re-positioning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guided by the flow of funds, I turned my attention to &lt;strong&gt;Meituan&lt;/strong&gt;. However, this time, I didn’t delve into the company’s &lt;strong&gt;financial data&lt;/strong&gt;, its &lt;strong&gt;historical trends&lt;/strong&gt;, or even realize the raging &lt;strong&gt;food delivery war&lt;/strong&gt; that was unfolding. When the stock price began to fall, I failed to cut my losses in time and instead blindly &lt;strong&gt;added to my position&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares trading at HK$20,000-30,000, limitations on capital prevented me from managing my positions freely, which undoubtedly exacerbated my losses in Meituan. This lesson deeply made me realize that in the Hong Kong stock market, blind re-positioning is like trying to fill a constantly leaking bathtub with more water – it only accelerates the loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stupid-people-are-lucky---an-unexpected-gain&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Stupid People Are Lucky&amp;rdquo; - An Unexpected Gain
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was worrying about Meituan&amp;rsquo;s losses, an unexpected turn of events occurred – I bought &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba&lt;/strong&gt;. Although I didn’t hold onto it, I quickly sold it and used the profit to offset some of Meituan’s losses. This might be what’s meant by “stupid people are lucky,” allowing me to temporarily escape Meituan&amp;rsquo;s predicament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;finance-more-important-fundamentals-than-investing&#34;&gt;Finance: More Important Fundamentals Than Investing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This experience also made me re-examine my &lt;strong&gt;financial management&lt;/strong&gt; approach, aside from the ups and downs of the stock market. At the time, I invested a sum intended for short-term emergency funds into &lt;strong&gt;Chinese bonds&lt;/strong&gt;. This money was meant to be used for payment within two months, but the short-term holding yield on the bonds wasn&amp;rsquo;t high, and it also posed liquidity issues. If I had instead chosen to deposit this money into a &lt;strong&gt;money fund&lt;/strong&gt;, I could have earned more stable returns and readily redeemed it, better meeting my funding needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hong Kong Stock Exchange Brokerage Fee Liberalization and Market Competition</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-stock-exchange-brokerage-fee-liberalization-and-market-competition/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 21:47:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/hong-kong-stock-exchange-brokerage-fee-liberalization-and-market-competition/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The practice of “the same contract code, for transactions in the same direction, commission is only charged once” is commonly referred to as &lt;strong&gt;“Commission Aggregation / Combined Commission”&lt;/strong&gt; within the securities industry. This is not a hard-and-fast regulation by the Hong Kong Exchange or regulatory bodies, but rather a business convention formed through market competition and brokers’ efforts to optimize customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding HK stocks, when the same contract code is used for transactions in the same direction, only one commission is charged – does this have any historical business background?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-historical-turning-points-cancellation-of-the-minimum-commission-rule-in-2003&#34;&gt;Key Historical Turning Points: Cancellation of the Minimum Commission Rule in 2003
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the most important background to understand this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-Reform (Before April 1, 2003):&lt;/strong&gt; The Hong Kong stock market operated under a &lt;strong&gt;Minimum Commission Rule&lt;/strong&gt;. At the time, brokers were required to charge clients a commission of no less than 0.25% of the transaction value. During this period, all brokerage commissions were essentially locked at the same level, and competition primarily focused on research capabilities, client relationships, and service quality; price wars were virtually non-existent. Therefore, there was no incentive to consolidate commissions for clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Reform (After April 1, 2003):&lt;/strong&gt; The Hong Kong Exchange officially &lt;strong&gt;abolished the Minimum Commission Rule&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing brokers and clients to freely negotiate commission rates. This reform instantly ignited competition in the Hong Kong securities industry, particularly commission price wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-product-of-fierce-market-competition&#34;&gt;A Product of Fierce Market Competition
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the removal of minimum commission fees, securities firms (particularly emerging internet brokers) have adopted various innovative pricing strategies to attract customers. “Consolidated Commission” is one such highly attractive initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attracting Active Traders:&lt;/strong&gt; For high-frequency traders or investors who prefer to buy and sell the same stock in batches (such as to avoid large single orders impacting market prices), per-trade fees can significantly increase transaction costs. The “Consolidated Commission” policy perfectly addresses this pain point, allowing investors to flexibly establish or liquidate positions within a day without worrying about multiple commission charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing Customer Transaction Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the most direct objective. By consolidating calculations, customer actual commission expenses are reduced, making the broker’s platform more competitive in terms of cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing Customer Experience and Loyalty:&lt;/strong&gt; This customer-friendly policy greatly enhances the user experience, making customers feel that the broker is looking out for their interests, thereby strengthening customer loyalty and retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;business-logic-and-brokerage-interests&#34;&gt;Business Logic and Brokerage Interests
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although superficially, brokerage revenue appears to be declining, from a holistic business logic perspective, it’s a win-win situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Margin, High Volume:&lt;/strong&gt; Reducing the effective cost of each transaction can stimulate customers to trade more frequently, thereby increasing overall trading volume. While brokers “give away” commissions on individual trades, they can compensate by increasing total transaction volume and earning other fees, such as platform usage fees and financing/margin interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Share Acquisition:&lt;/strong&gt; In a fiercely competitive market, particularly for new internet brokerages, low commission rates and promotional policies are the most effective means of quickly acquiring users and capturing market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-points-to-note&#34;&gt;Key Points to Note
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not All Brokers Offer It:&lt;/strong&gt; While “merged commission” has become mainstream, it’s still a broker&amp;rsquo;s business decision and not a mandatory regulation. Some traditional brokers or banks may still charge per trade for their securities services, so investors need to carefully review the broker’s fee schedule when choosing a broker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only Applies to “Commission”:&lt;/strong&gt; Be sure to note that the calculated merged amount only includes the “commission” charged by the broker. Any “fixed fees” collected by the government or exchanges are calculated per trade and cannot be merged. These include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stamp Duty (印花税):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.1% (Paid by both buyer and seller, rounded up to the nearest dollar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SFC Transaction Levy (交易征费):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.0027% (Collected by the Securities and Futures Commission)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HKEX Trading Fee (交易费):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.00565% (Collected by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRC Transaction Levy (会财局交易征费):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.00015% (Collected by the Financial Regulatory Authority)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary, the “merged commission” policy of Hong Kong brokers is rooted in the abolition of the Minimum Commission System in 2003. It was a significant business strategy adopted by brokers in an environment of market liberalization and intense competition – to reduce customer costs, enhance service experience, attract and retain customers – representing a microcosm of Hong Kong’s financial market transitioning from traditional to modern, from high barriers to accessibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no lock-up period;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They can be bought and sold freely on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange secondary market;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The offering may not be completed, and requires fulfillment of multiple prerequisites (such as market stability, regulatory approval, and the absence of significant adverse events)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is not completed within 14 days, the subscription matter will automatically become invalid.&lt;/li&gt;

Jiu Fang Investment plans to use HK$746 million to invest in digital assets and on-chain finance, potentially transitioning towards Web3 and AI robo-advisor directions in the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-old-then-new-distribution-method-explained&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;First Old, Then New&amp;rdquo; Distribution Method Explained
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimi: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Existing shareholders first old shares then new&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; is a &lt;strong&gt;common Hong Kong distribution method&lt;/strong&gt;, known in English as &lt;strong&gt;Top-up Placement&lt;/strong&gt;, which you can understand as a two-step operation of “&lt;strong&gt;major shareholders sell old shares first and then subscribe to new shares&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-lets-take-an-example-to-understand-it&#34;&gt;✅ Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example to understand it
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking the case of &lt;strong&gt;Jiutian Intelligence Investment&lt;/strong&gt; as an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Major shareholders sell old shares (First Old)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing shareholders (such as Coreworth Investments) sell their existing holdings of &lt;strong&gt;20,000,000 old shares&lt;/strong&gt; to market investors (the underwriter) at a price of HKD 39.25 per share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This results in the &lt;strong&gt;major shareholder reducing their holding&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;total issued capital remains unchanged&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Company issues new shares to major shareholders (Later New)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company then issues an equal number (&lt;strong&gt;20,000,000 shares&lt;/strong&gt;) of new shares to these major shareholders at a price of HKD 39.25.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The major shareholder uses the proceeds from selling old shares to buy back new shares, &lt;strong&gt;restoring their holding quantity to its original state&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the total issued capital increases (from 448 million shares to 468 million shares), &lt;strong&gt;effectively meaning the company has successfully raised capital&lt;/strong&gt;, while the &lt;strong&gt;major shareholder&amp;rsquo;s shareholding ratio is slightly diluted&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-why-are-we-doing-this&#34;&gt;✅ Why are we doing this?

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Fundraising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Avoid the lengthy process of issuing new shares, instead selling old shares first and then supplementing with new shares to quickly raise capital.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The majority shareholders will maintain their voting power, and control won&amp;rsquo;t be significantly diluted.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attract New Investors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Through discounted share sales (private placements), attract institutional or high-net-worth investors to enter the market, optimizing the shareholder structure.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;td&gt;⚠️ Lock-up Period (typically 180 days)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Shares newly issued by the company, given to original shareholders, and typically require a lock-up period.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sell Old, Buy New&amp;rdquo; refers to major shareholders initially selling their existing shares to the market and then purchasing an equal amount of new shares from the company, simultaneously raising capital for the company while maintaining control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hong-kong-stock-connect-issuance-rules-interpretation&#34;&gt;Hong Kong Stock Connect Issuance Rules Interpretation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimi: Your question is very central: &lt;strong&gt;Why do Hong Kong-listed companies seem to be able to “freely” issue shares? Is the Hong Kong market rulebook particularly relaxed?&lt;/strong&gt;
The answer is: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, HKEX offers significantly more flexibility than the Shanghai A-share market&lt;/strong&gt;, but it’s &lt;strong&gt;not “unlimited,”&lt;/strong&gt; rather there&amp;rsquo;s a system of &lt;strong&gt;“relaxed but limited” rules.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it require shareholder meeting approval?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅ The Board of Directors can authorize share issuance not exceeding &lt;strong&gt;20% of the total equity&lt;/strong&gt; annually at the annual general meeting, and no further meetings are required thereafter.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌ Each issuance must be held with a &lt;strong&gt;separate shareholder meeting&lt;/strong&gt; and pass by a 2/3 majority vote.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it require SEC approval?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌ As long as it’s no more than 20% of share capital + offering price is no more than 20%, it can “flash allocation”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅ Must undergo SEC &lt;strong&gt;case-by-case review&lt;/strong&gt;, which takes longer&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-why-does-the-hong-kong-stock-exchange-look-casual&#34;&gt;✅ Why Does the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Look “Casual”?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“General Mandate” Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt;
Once a year, shareholders authorize the board to issue up to 20% new shares at their annual general meeting. Afterwards, &lt;strong&gt;no further shareholder meetings are required&lt;/strong&gt;, and the board can selectively issue shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Flash Placement” Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt;
If the issuance does not exceed 20% of the share capital and the discount is no more than 20%, &lt;strong&gt;the issuance can be completed within 24 hours without approval&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No SEC Case-by-Case Approval:
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange only conducts &lt;strong&gt;formative review&lt;/strong&gt;, without substantive intervention in the use of funds or company quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-lets-take-an-example-why-was-jiufang-zhitou-able-to-do-old-and-new-this-time&#34;&gt;✅ Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example: Why was JiuFang ZhiTou able to &amp;ldquo;do old and new&amp;rdquo; this time?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JiuFang ZhiTou obtained a &lt;strong&gt;general authorization&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;strong&gt;2025 June 20th shareholder meeting&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing for up to a 20% increase in new shares (i.e., up to 89,671,400 shares).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This issuance of 20,000,000 shares represents only &lt;strong&gt;4.46% of the capital&lt;/strong&gt;, far below the 20% limit, and &lt;strong&gt;fully complies with the authorization conditions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;no further shareholder meeting is needed&lt;/strong&gt; nor &lt;strong&gt;is approval from the Securities Regulatory Commission required&lt;/strong&gt;; the board of directors can make the decision to implement it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-summary-in-one-sentence-1&#34;&gt;✅ Summary in one sentence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong stocks allow “board of directors + annual authorization” rapid issuance under a streamlined process, provided it doesn’t exceed 20% of the share capital and the price cap, enabling “flash placement,” while A-shares require shareholder approval plus SEC review, resulting in a longer, more restrictive procedure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-summary-in-one-sentence-2&#34;&gt;✅ Summary in one sentence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Jiu Fang Zhi Tu (Nine Fang Intelligent Investment) is not “arbitrary issuance,” but rather &lt;strong&gt;legally and compliantly utilized the relaxed mechanisms of the Hong Kong stock market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
