        <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t know politics, don’t make comments, record this “carnival” on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;musings&#34;&gt;Musings
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Tangshan Assault Incident&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Primary School Textbook Cultural Invasion Incident&lt;/strong&gt; – I wonder how many people even remember them anymore. These trending news stories have become numbingly commonplace, without much feeling, and I just watch TV as usual after work, observing the spectacle. The economic situation is already dire; a war wouldn’t make things any better.  I don&amp;rsquo;t understand politics or offer commentary, simply recording this internet-fueled “carnival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wiki-overviewhttpszhwikipediaorgwiki2022e5b9b4e58d97e8a5bfc2b7e8a3b4e6b49be8a5bfe8a8aae5958fe58fb0e781a3&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E5%B9%B4%E5%8D%97%E8%A5%BF%C2%B7%E8%A3%B4%E6%B4%9B%E8%A5%BF%E8%A8%AA%E5%95%8F%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Wiki Overview&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nancy Pelosi visit to Taiwan, also known as the Pelosi visit to Taiwan, refers to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s 2022 visit to Asia, specifically her itinerary which included a stop in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the U.S. House Speaker being considered the third-highest official in the United States and plans to visit Taiwan, the date was approaching shortly before the Chinese People&amp;rsquo;s Liberation Army&amp;rsquo;s (PLA) 70th Founding Day on August 1st, and long-term it approached the Communist Party of China’s Twentieth National Congress, the 2022 U.S. elections, and the 2022 Taiwan local elections. The government of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China issued a strong protest, dispatching destroyer task forces to the northeast waters of the Taiwan Strait and mobilizing the Shandong and Liaoning aircraft carrier strike groups, with the Eastern Theater Command and Southern Theater Command conducting large-scale live-fire exercises in the East Sea and South China Sea respectively. On the U.S. side, the Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier strike group arrived around the Taiwan Strait to guard Pelosi’s possible visit itinerary, and multiple waves of reconnaissance aircraft and aerial refueling tankers were deployed on standby at Japan&amp;rsquo;s Camp Hikawa Air Base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden had a video meeting before the visit, which covered the issue of Taiwan. Taiwanese and international media reported that Speaker Pelosi and the House delegation would arrive at Songshan Airport in Taipei on the 2nd, stay overnight, and meet with Taiwan’s Presidential Office level officials including President Tsai Ing-wen on the 3rd. Some analysts believe this visit could potentially lead to a new crisis in the Taiwan Strait, similar to the 1996 Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis, after 26 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;08-11&#34;&gt;08-11
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By today, this has pretty much settled down. During this time, the headlines were dominated by various naval exercises, and Zhihu was putting in a lot of effort to update its trending charts every day, talking about all of this. Let the reporters work hard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
