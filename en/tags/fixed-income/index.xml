        <description>&lt;p&gt;Those of us born in the 90s, we didn’t really feel the impact of the 2008 financial crisis – after all, we were young and hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet started to focus on finance. The roaring bull market of 2015 came with a lot of fanfare, and when it ended, it made quite a stir, ultimately requiring government intervention to stabilize the markets. Simultaneously, this brought the concept of “funds” into the view of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ant-financial-and-alipay&#34;&gt;Ant Financial and Alipay
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alipay, as a natural traffic entry under Ant Financial, was born with the positioning of a payment tool. When purchasing funds, most people chose Alipay like WeChat did. Alipay successfully transformed fund sales into an ordinary shopping experience. Starting in 2019, with the small bull market, fund managers’ “warming up” recruitment, ultimately stemmed from the monetary loosening guided by the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who entered made money, those who didn&amp;rsquo;t enter were envious and rushed to join in. The scale of new funds broke through the hundred billion mark at an increasingly rapid pace, and a trillion-fund market was not far off, even in scenarios where “grandmothers” (older investors) started buying funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Ant Financial’s explosive rise as a code-based internet fund sales platform, ordinary people&amp;rsquo;s contact with fund sales was primarily through depositing money at banks, where the bank manager would enthusiastically introduce various investment products. The packaging of the internet, promotional pages guiding information, and exorbitant advertising fees paid by fund sales institutions completely detached Alipay’s fund advertisements from reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal bank fixed-term investment returns are 4%, P2P investments that were played wildly in recent years reached 8%, credit card repayment interest rates are 12%. Our protagonist, Alipay&amp;rsquo;s promoted funds of 150% and 250% are trending, making insiders happy. The market declines? Alipay is playing with fire.&lt;/strong&gt; The advertised growth figures only show the three-year returns, while traditional fund companies only provide annualized average returns. Why don’t they dare to present the annual average returns separately? It&amp;rsquo;s not because it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to calculate – the answer is no, because unfavorable data doesn’t encourage customers to buy funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fixed-income-investments&#34;&gt;Fixed Income Investments
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;China hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet entered a negative interest rate era, making bank deposits and government bonds the most secure fixed-income products. Pure credit funds are also a good option. You can refer to the data published by local statistical bureaus to find China’s average wage levels. Here’s a simple scenario: with an asset size of 2 million (CNY), a yearly yield of 4% converted, the annual income would exceed most cities&amp;rsquo; average wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is largely based on my personal experiences, and there’s much more to say. If you want to learn more, I recommend reading a variety of economic books yourself – don&amp;rsquo;t blindly follow. For ordinary families, the core of financial planning is preservation, not chasing risky dreams of getting rich quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle often says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right thing at the right time has the greatest value; study diligently when you’re studying, and earning a good degree is better than making pocket money by distributing flyers; work seriously when you first graduate, and your salary increases can bring you substantial returns; and when you start a family, learn to take care of your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those interested can take a look at this speech transcript: “On Time,” you’ll need to read many books to find the answers – the text of the speech is available on our site.&lt;/p&gt;
