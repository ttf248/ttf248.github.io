        <title>Capital Monopoly and the Demise of the Online Education Industry</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent two trading days have seen a significant stock market decline, exposing newcomers to the risks of the market. China is about to enter an aging demographic phase, and birth rates are dismal, with the reduction exceeding the estimates of relevant experts, hindering industries that obstruct declining birth rates; the Party will take decisive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;student-burden-reduction&#34;&gt;Student Burden Reduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of us born in the 1990s didn’t have as many extracurricular classes, tutoring programs, or the freedom to run wild after school. This was primarily due to our families&amp;rsquo; limited resources, and secondarily because tutoring companies hadn’t yet established a strong brand reputation, making it difficult for parents to trust them. Twenty years have passed since then, and starting in 2019, the K12 education capitalization trend emerged, with companies like猿辅导 (Yuancuizou – literally “Monkey Tutoring”) appearing as online tutoring platforms based on code. With the backing of capital, these companies created various high-end tutoring programs by concentrating excellent resources. Despite exorbitant fees, parents’ enthusiasm remained undeterred. &amp;gt; During the urbanization process, many parents have relied on education as a path to escape from humble backgrounds and achieve a social class leap. As wage laborers themselves, they lack sufficient time to care for their children, adding to their own intense competition and reluctance to see their children fall behind peers. Given the difficulty of rising above one&amp;rsquo;s origins (“noble offspring”) in traditional Chinese society, and the limited options for maintaining or advancing one’s social class without a suitable education, ordinary families find it difficult to sustain their current status or make another upward leap. Enrolling children in vocational schools is seen as an unacceptable slide down the social ladder – a perspective largely held by parents within the current societal environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-student-burden&#34;&gt;Reducing Student Burden
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s revisit the reasons behind extracurricular tutoring and why parents seek it out. Textbook knowledge and example questions are straightforward – many students can understand them easily. However, most subjects cover broad concepts superficially without delving deeply into them. The talent selection mechanism requires differentiation, which leads to a contradiction: exam questions based solely on textbook knowledge cannot effectively filter candidates. This necessitates horizontal and vertical expansion of knowledge. These areas are aspects that teachers simply cannot cover in the classroom, creating the fertile ground for extracurricular tutoring to flourish. The document contains a large amount of content, with thirty detailed regulations covering multiple aspects. The document outline summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comprehensively reduce the workload and duration for students, alleviating excessive academic burdens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance the level of after-school services offered by schools to meet diverse student needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain strict governance, comprehensively regulate external training activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significantly improve educational teaching quality to ensure students master and excel in their studies within the school environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen supporting governance and enhance support capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully organize and implement the measures to achieve tangible results. ## Reducing Student Burden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;elite-education&#34;&gt;Elite Education
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a phenomenon in the education sector – the increasing prevalence of powerful private schools. Public schools are struggling to provide sufficient high-quality resources (leading to enclaves/gated communities). Various sized educational groups are attracting excellent teachers with high salaries, establishing quality learning environments, and gradually building their own brands, most notably: &lt;strong&gt;Hen Shuai Model&lt;/strong&gt;. Old Home Company averages over 3000 RMB, powerful private primary schools charge between 9000 and 10000 RMB per year. Educational groups form a virtuous cycle – my tuition is expensive, but the teachers are excellent, students achieve good grades, I raise my tuition fees, and parents will still send their children there. Public school resources (teachers) are gradually being drawn to private schools, ultimately becoming synonymous with substandard education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;algorithmic-optimization&#34;&gt;Algorithmic Optimization
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is data indicating that Meituan’s contracted delivery riders have approached 4 million, with approximately 400,000 active riders. Many people rely on this work to support their families and livelihoods. The relentless algorithmic pressure to minimize delivery times reduces individuals into measurable units, feeding them into algorithms for constant calculation and exploration of the delivery rider&amp;rsquo;s breaking point. Believing themselves clever, &lt;strong&gt;they violate human nature and serve capital&lt;/strong&gt;. The market operates here, allowing everyone to play and enjoy sustainable play, rather than &lt;strong&gt;monopolizing, wielding privileges, capitalist gameplay, and the unrestrained, barbaric growth that will inevitably come to an end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility&#34;&gt;Stock Market Volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 2021, education stocks represented by New Oriental performed a dramatic plunge, followed by Good Future in the pre-market session of the U.S. stock market, with &lt;strong&gt;stock prices halved&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has gradually entered an aging society, and various social phenomena affecting family planning must be rectified; internet companies engaged in monopoly and overtime were fined, and the capital-concentrated education industry was also being scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;stock-market-volatility-1&#34;&gt;Stock Market Volatility
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The education industry is not allowed to be capitalized on; a single vote directly rejected relevant industries from going public for financing, and there was wailing everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
