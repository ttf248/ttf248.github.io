        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Mining&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s undeniable that the surge of big data, coupled with recent news about competitive matches, always prompts me to take a look. Similar videos on TikTok have been proactively dismissed – I don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep receiving homogenous content. I also forgot about an account; unsurprisingly, TES lost decisively, and related topics were trending on Zhihu’s hot list. A highly-voted answer mentioned LPL’s Korean reinforcements and the concept of “all Chinese team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without that year’s IG victory, League of Legends is likely already over. ldl&amp;rsquo;s strategic play, combined with multiple debuffs, contributed to LPL’s performance as a region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing article: Why does LPL, China’s League of Legends regional league, introduce Korean players? From the coaching staff to the players, reinforcements have been introduced, whether this limits the development of domestic players, and then domestically there is still hope for a Chinese all-star team to win, whether this belongs to the obsession of the Chinese people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the “Korean Wave” began flooding the LPL at the end of S4, Korean players and coaches have become an indispensable part of this region. From iG’s (Rookie, TheShy) in S8 and FPX’s (Doinb, GimGoon) in S9, to EDG’s (Scout, Viper) in S11, LPL has three times lifted the global World Championship (S-Series) trophy, with Korean players and coaches playing a crucial role in each victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, simultaneously, a resounding slogan has consistently permeated the LPL’s public opinion – “All Chinese Team.” While audiences celebrate LPL’s championships, they also harbor almost obsessive expectations for a “Chinese team” to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did LPL introduce Korean players? Does this limit the development of domestic players? And what exactly is the origin of the “All Chinese Team” obsession?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-introducing-korean-talent-a-catalyst-from-chase-to-lead&#34;&gt;Why Introducing Korean Talent: A “Catalyst” From Chase to Lead
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LPL’s introduction of Korean talent was initially driven by a purely pragmatic goal: &lt;strong&gt;to win.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the S3 and S4 periods, LCK (South Korea&amp;rsquo;s league) dominated &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; with its impeccable operations and unparalleled individual player abilities. As a challenger, the LPL’s fastest and most direct “copywork” strategy was to bring in “teachers” – top players and coaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Demand for Battle-Ready Talent and Guaranteed Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the disintegration of Samsung White and Samsung Blue in S4, a large number of top Korean players entered the LPL. They brought with them the most advanced game understanding and the highest level of operational skill. The arrival of Rookies, Doinb, Pawn, and Mata quickly elevated the limits of teams like LNG, WE, and EDG. For clubs, this was a necessary commercial choice in pursuit of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Introducing an Advanced “Esports Industrial System”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LPL didn’t just bring in players; it also brought in coaching staff and the underlying training system. Korean esports is renowned for its strict discipline, data-driven approach, and high-intensity training model. The arrival of coaches like Kkoma and DanDy brought LCK management experience and tactical reserves into the LPL, forcing LPL clubs to transition from “internet cafe-style” management to “professionalized” management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &amp;ldquo;Catfish Effect&amp;rdquo;: Activating Internal Competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of top Korean players was like introducing a catfish into a pond. Local players had to grow faster and adapt to higher levels of competition in order to maintain their starting positions. From this perspective, Korean talent (such as TheShy, Rookie) wasn’t just an “overseas player,” but also a “senior sparring partner” and “teammate teacher” for domestic players (such as JackeyLove, Ming, Knight), collectively raising the overall average level of the entire LPL league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-double-edged-sword-has-korean-support-been-a-limitation-or-a-catalyst-for-domestic-development&#34;&gt;A Double-Edged Sword: Has Korean Support Been a “Limitation” or a “Catalyst” for Domestic Development?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of LPL’s most controversial topics in history, and the answer is &lt;strong&gt;“both”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “Restrictive Viewpoint”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupied Survival Space:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the most direct impact. When LPL&amp;rsquo;s top teams habitually reserved key C-positions (mid laner, top laner) for Korean players (like the infamous &amp;ldquo;Mid Laner Must Speak Korean&amp;rdquo; joke), it made it even harder for promising domestic rookies to get playing time. With only one position available per game, Korean players’ priority did, to a certain extent, “suppress” the rise of some domestic talents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication Costs and Tactical Monotony:&lt;/strong&gt; Early &amp;ldquo;3-2&amp;rdquo; patterns (three Chinese players supporting two Korean players) often led to communication breakdowns. Team tactics sometimes became monotonous due to accommodating Korean players&amp;rsquo; habits, lacking the LPL-style &amp;ldquo;dare-to-play-boldly&amp;rdquo; style of domestic players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “Promotional Viewpoint”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevated Domestic Player’s “Lower and Upper Limits”:&lt;/strong&gt; LPL domestic players (like Tian, Ming, Knight) grew up through competing with and learning from players like Rookie, Doinb, Ruler, and Viper. The opponents they faced in the S-Series were often stronger than their daily training game teammates. This intense internal competition was a key reason for the explosive growth of LPL domestic talent (especially support and jungler positions).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LPL’s “Blood Generation” Capability is Now Number One Globally:&lt;/strong&gt; The fact is, LPL currently has the largest and most complete youth system (LDL). LPL doesn&amp;rsquo;t lack &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo;; it lacks the very top &amp;ldquo;towering&amp;rdquo; players. The introduction of Korean players was precisely to fill this final piece of the &amp;ldquo;tower.&amp;rdquo; Furthermore, LPL’s “assimilation” ability is extremely strong; Rookie and Doinb eventually became “LPL domestic players.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, LPL, through introducing Korean players, &lt;strong&gt;traded “space” for “time.”&lt;/strong&gt; It sacrificed some domestic players&amp;rsquo; short-term playing opportunities but gained the rapid elevation of the entire league’s competitive level and three S-Series championships, ultimately feeding back into its own youth system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-chinese-team-a-near-obsessive-national-pride-sentiment&#34;&gt;“All-Chinese Team”: A Near-Obsessive National Pride Sentiment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If introducing Korean reinforcements is a &amp;ldquo;rational&amp;rdquo; competitive choice, then pursuing the “All-Chinese Team” represents an “emotional” national sentiment. Simply labeling this desire as “fanaticism” is incomplete; it has deep cultural and historical roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The Essence of Sports is “Nation/Region Confrontation”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s traditional sports (like the Olympics) or esports, when it rises to the international competition stage, it naturally carries a national/regional honor color. Viewers seeking excitement while watching games are not just looking for competitive thrills; they&amp;rsquo;re also seeking an identity affirmation of “our people” winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Ultimate Proof: &amp;ldquo;We Can Win Ourselves&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LPL has already proven itself capable of winning through a combination of Chinese and Korean players. However, “All-Chinese Team winning” is another dimension of the narrative: it means that the LPL region achieved a &lt;strong&gt;holistic victory&lt;/strong&gt; – from players and coaches to tactics and youth training systems. This represents the ultimate proof of &amp;ldquo;we can stand at the top of the world without external force.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Historical Regrets and RNG’s “Deification”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obsession with the “All-Chinese Team” is deeply intertwined with the narrative of the RNG team (especially during Uzi&amp;rsquo;s time). In S8, that all-Chinese team RNG won MSI, giving countless LPL viewers hope for &amp;ldquo;All-Chinese Team winning a World Championship Series.&amp;rdquo; Although S8 ultimately failed, the regret of “just missing it” further reinforced this obsession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The Catalyst of the Asian Games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2018 Jakarta and 2023 Hangzhou Asian Games both required “All-Chinese Team” lineups for the “League of Legends” project. When esports combined with the traditional sports model of &amp;ldquo;contributing to national glory,&amp;rdquo; the “All-Chinese Team” evolved from a “fan’s expectation” into a “national team standard,” further deepening viewers&amp;rsquo; identification with domestic rosters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-from-borrowing-strength-to-legitimizing&#34;&gt;Conclusion: From &amp;ldquo;Borrowing Strength&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Legitimizing&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of Korean support (韩援) into LPL was a necessary strategy in its early development, driven by the need to quickly catch up and achieve “overtaking” – a strategy that has been definitively proven successful by the championship trophies won by S8, S9, and S11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of Korean support did not &amp;ldquo;restrict&amp;rdquo; the development of LPL; instead, through the “catfish effect” (鲶鱼效应) and “internal teaching,” it &lt;strong&gt;significantly accelerated the growth of LPL’s native talent&lt;/strong&gt;, transforming LPL into the now-recognized number one region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obsession with a “full Chinese team” (全华班) was not narrow xenophobia, but rather &lt;strong&gt;a peak of domestic confidence leading to a desire for “ultimate glory”&lt;/strong&gt; – representing what LPL viewers hoped to see: a perfect closed loop where this region would transition from “reliance on foreign support” to “self-sufficiency and dominance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of LPL is a microcosm of the intersection of globalization and localization. We enjoy the extreme operations brought by Ruler and Scout, and we will also shed tears for RNG in 2018 and the &amp;ldquo;full Chinese team&amp;rdquo; representing China at the 2023 Asian Games. This is not contradictory; it’s simply different pursuits at different stages of a region&amp;rsquo;s journey from “student” to “master.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The End of the Age of Wild Capitalism: The Era of League of Legends Esports Concludes</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-league-of-legends-era/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:19:39 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/end-of-league-of-legends-era/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The esports industry has experienced rapid development over the past decade and a half, becoming an increasingly significant cultural phenomenon worldwide. Particularly MOBA games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; (LoL), which is often abbreviated as LOL, not only provide players with the joy of competition but also inject powerful momentum into capital, driving the flourishing development of various esports platforms and events. However, all of this has entered a phase of gradual decline with the influx of capital and the rise of the entertainment industry. The rise and fall of PandyTV, the competition between DouYu and Huya, marks the end of the “wild capitalism era,” and the favorable conditions – time, place, people, and heaven – for esports seem to be starting to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-injection&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Injection
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1 The Early Days of Electronic Sports: From Grassroots to Professionalization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early esports industry started relatively grassroots, especially in China. Many players participated in competitive games like &lt;em&gt;StarCraft&lt;/em&gt; and Dota, driven by their passion for the games. However, the true rise of esports began with the release and promotion of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Following the official entry of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; into the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche community to part of mainstream culture. Notably starting in 2013, the LPL (China Professional League) was established, and &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; became the cornerstone of China’s esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.2 Capital Frenzy Influx: The Rise of PandaTV and Esports Live Streaming Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 marked a watershed moment for the Chinese esports industry. The influx of capital transformed esports from a purely competitive event into a much larger ecosystem. PandaTV, one of the representatives, became a product of excessive capital. Invested by one of its founders, Wang Sicong, PandaTV quickly rose to prominence with its innovative content and massive investment, attracting a large number of viewers and users. However, this was also a typical example of capital “barbaric” inflow – the relentless pursuit of markets often lacks patience and long-term vision. Although PandaTV’s short-term investments achieved certain results due to management issues and excessive reliance on high fever caused by capital, it ultimately declared bankruptcy in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.3 Live Streaming Platform Competition: The “Capital War” Between DouYu and Huya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demise of PandaTV did not lead to the decline of the esports live streaming industry; instead, it propelled the rise of platforms like Douyu and Huya. Douyu and Huya became leading players in the esports industry, and their competition intensified. Early on, Douyu established itself as a benchmark for esports live streaming through the broadcasting of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; professional competitions and the signing of top streamers. Huya, meanwhile, gradually narrowed the gap with Douyu by increasing its investment in esports events and diversifying its platform layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this process, capital played a huge role again. In 2018, Douyu successfully went public, and Huya also completed its IPO the same year. The rapid flow of capital led to industry consolidation and intensified competition between platforms in terms of streamers and copyrights, forming a “capital war.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-fusion-of-mass-entertainment-and-esports&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Fusion of Mass Entertainment and Esports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1 The Trend Towards Mass Entertainment: Capital Flows into Diversified Entertainment Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As capital has heavily invested in the esports industry, esports platform content is gradually becoming mass-entertained. Esports anchors are no longer limited to match commentary and event live streaming; they have begun to expand into singing, dancing, interactive live streams, and other entertainment forms. The content on platforms is becoming more diverse, gradually forming an ecosystem centered around esports but also incorporating various entertainment elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this mass entertainment trend has also brought problems – the original focus of esports culture has been marginalized, replaced by a trend of entertainment above all else. This trend has caused some fans who originally loved esports culture to feel alienated, and capital has begun to pay more attention to other entertainment fields. The excessive influx of capital and profit-seeking behavior have gradually blurred the essence of the esports industry, and the original value concept centered around competition has been weakened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2 The Rise of Mass Entertainment Industry: Capital Withdrawal and Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and the entertainment industry have risen, capital has gradually shifted funds from esports to a wider range of entertainment content. In this process, giants such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance no longer rely solely on esports projects as sources of revenue, but are increasing their investments in areas such as film, music, and short videos.  In particular, the rise of ByteDance, through the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin (TikTok), has overshadowed the limelight of esports with other entertainment content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-league-of-legends-yellow-not-following-yellow-the-decline-of-the-eras-advantage&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: League of Legends’ “Yellow Not Following Yellow”: The Decline of the Era’s Advantage
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has almost become synonymous with China&amp;rsquo;s esports industry, achieving countless professional players, teams, and events, and also spawning a massive esports ecosystem. However, after more than ten years, as a leading project in Chinese esports, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; has entered a phase of “Yellow Not Following Yellow” – a period of decline. Particularly in recent years, the influence of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; is gradually waning, even exhibiting obvious signs of recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1 The “Fracture” in Player Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most noticeable change is the fragmentation of player groups. Initially, esports’ rapid development relied on the support of a large number of young players, many of whom became professional players or spectators thanks to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. That generation of &amp;ldquo;internet addiction&amp;rdquo; teenagers almost grew up under the “era’s advantage,” immersed in the competitive charm of LOL and thus driving the rapid expansion of the entire industry. However, as time went on, these players gradually matured, entered society, and began to shift towards other life and career paths. At the same time, a new generation of young players are not as enthusiastic about &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; as in its heyday, and the esports audience has exhibited a clear age bias and decline in interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2 The “Weakness” in Game Content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, after multiple updates and revisions, still maintains a certain competitive charm, but the game’s own innovation in content appears somewhat lacking. Each year&amp;rsquo;s version updates, hero balance adjustments, and new gameplay introductions seem unable to fundamentally address players’ demand for freshness. Meanwhile, the MOBA market has become saturated, and other types of games (such as &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Game For Peace&lt;/em&gt;) have rapidly risen, diverting a large number of players who originally belonged to &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. This competitive situation has left &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; unable to escape the role of “follower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-where-does-the-esports-industry-go-from-here&#34;&gt;Conclusion: Where Does the Esports Industry Go From Here?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The esports industry is like a skyscraper that sprung up seemingly overnight, with excessive capital roaming the internet sector, searching for the next big trend – and esports has become one of their targets. Leveraging China’s demographic dividend, the industry achieved tremendous success in a short period, but this success wasn&amp;rsquo;t built on a solid foundation. Excessive capital influx, talent shortages, and weak game content are all hindering the healthy development of the esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to university, I didn’t play many games; Alliance essentially accompanied my growth alongside generations. I watched countless World Finals, and as an outsider, comparing ourselves to Korean and Chinese players, especially Faker, domestic players always felt hesitant during major tournaments. I also know that athletes face immense psychological pressure, but this hasn&amp;rsquo;t been prioritized by teams. Over a decade of development, these mental health issues should be taken seriously, yet they weren’t. Domestic gameplay still relies on the innate talent of the players themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
