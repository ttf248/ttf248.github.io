        <title>Feeling bored and wanting to design a Chinese ink wash style theme.</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve gotten tired of staring at colorful, cluttered homepages and suddenly want to go for a minimalist style, designing a Chinese ink wash theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the current stylesheet is heavily customized, with specific styles configured to override the default theme styles for different elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without refactoring, I tried using AI directly to generate a new theme, and the results were very unstable.  Coincidentally, I also encountered a queue for trae claude large language model switching to vscode agent mode, which resulted in even worse effects – the generated output had no design sense whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that I don’t fully understand front-end development and can&amp;rsquo;t effectively break down tasks and hand them over to AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
