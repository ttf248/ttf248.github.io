        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve grown tired of endlessly tweaking my homepage and suddenly want to embrace a minimalist style, designing a Chinese ink wash theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the stylesheet is heavily customized – specific styles are configured to override the default theme styles for different elements. Without refactoring, I attempted to generate a new theme directly using AI, but the results were incredibly unstable.  Coincidentally, I also encountered a queue for trae claude large model, switching to vscode agent mode, which further degraded the results; the generated output lacked any design sense. Ultimately, it comes down to my own lack of understanding of frontend development, preventing me from effectively breaking down tasks and delegating them to AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
