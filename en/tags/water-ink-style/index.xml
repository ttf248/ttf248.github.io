        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve grown tired of staring at colorful, cluttered homepages and suddenly want to embrace a minimalist style, designing a Chinese ink wash theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the stylesheet is heavily customized – specific styles are configured to override the default theme styles for different elements. Without refactoring, attempting to generate a new theme directly with AI yielded inconsistent results; it was difficult to describe—the output was very unstable.  Adding to this, I encountered a queue for trae claude large model and switched to vscode agent mode, which resulted in even worse outcomes – the generated changes lacked any design sense. Ultimately, it comes down to my own lack of understanding of frontend development, preventing me from effectively breaking down tasks and delegating them to AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
