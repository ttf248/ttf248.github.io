        <description>&lt;p&gt;This site’s main domain is hosted on GitHub Pages, and the blog’s backup subdomain is on Vercel with acceleration. It has been deployed through Cloudflare. The backend management page looks too outdated and unappealing, which is a major deterrent. Initially, it was a quiet, unassuming piece of content; however, constant messages in the blogging circles disrupted this tranquility – opening it up, CF went down, and many friends’ websites couldn&amp;rsquo;t be accessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an internet infrastructure component, such prolonged downtime is unacceptable. The stock price didn’t plummet dramatically, which I hadn’t anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare outage; many well-known websites are inaccessible. Pre-event stock drop, compiling relevant content, outputting articles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 18, 2025 (Tuesday) –&lt;/strong&gt; This morning (November 18th), Cloudflare, a major global internet infrastructure services provider, experienced a widespread network outage before the opening of U.S. markets, causing thousands of well-known websites and applications that rely on its services to become paralyzed or difficult to access worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this incident, Cloudflare’s (NYSE: NET) stock price fell sharply during pre-market trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-outage-affects-global-services-as-popular-platforms-go-down&#34;&gt;🌍 Outage Affects Global Services as Popular Platforms “Go Down”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outage began on Tuesday morning (approximately 7:00 AM Eastern Time, 11:48 GMT) and was reported globally. Users across the world were unable to access a number of popular services including social media platform &lt;strong&gt;X (formerly Twitter)&lt;/strong&gt;, artificial intelligence service &lt;strong&gt;OpenAI (ChatGPT)&lt;/strong&gt;, music streaming service &lt;strong&gt;Spotify&lt;/strong&gt;, game platforms &lt;strong&gt;League of Legends&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Valorant&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as numerous cryptocurrency exchanges (such as BitMEX, DefiLlama), among others.
Users attempting to access these websites generally encountered “500 Internal Server Error” messages. Given Cloudflare’s role as an “intermediary” in the internet, providing content delivery (CDN) and security protection (DDoS) for millions of websites worldwide, any “jitter” within its network immediately triggered a global chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-market-reaction-was-rapid-net-pre-market-stock-drop&#34;&gt;📉 Market Reaction Was Rapid, (NET) Pre-Market Stock Drop
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a key infrastructure component for the internet, Cloudflare’s service stability is of significant interest to investors. Following the release of the outage news, the capital markets reacted quickly. Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s (NYSE: NET) stock experienced heavy selling in pre-market trading on Tuesday. According to financial data, its price fell approximately &lt;strong&gt;3.5% to 4%&lt;/strong&gt;, dropping from a previous day’s close of around $202.25 on November 17th to levels as low as $195.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reflects investors&amp;rsquo; concerns regarding the severity of the service interruption and its potential impact on the company’s reputation and short-term revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-response-issue-identified-and-under-repair&#34;&gt;Official Response: Issue Identified and Under Repair
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s official team quickly confirmed this incident on its System Status page. The company updated the status at 13:09 UTC (November 18th) this afternoon (Beijing time) stating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The issue has been identified and remediation is being implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-official-response-issue-identified-and-under-repair&#34;&gt;🛠️ Official Response: Issue Identified and Under Repair
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cloudflare’s report, this incident has been classified as a “global network experiencing issues” (global network encountering problems) and accompanied by “widespread 500 errors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare stated that they are working to mitigate the issue and have observed service beginning to recover, but cautioned that customers may continue to observe “above normal error rates” during ongoing repair work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, access to some websites has begun to gradually restore, but global network latency and error rates remain high. We will continue to monitor the situation’s further development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>AI overuse can lead to some lingering effects.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-overuse-side-effects/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 19:39:50 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/ai-overuse-side-effects/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since we’ve established “AI Inspiration Collision Forum,” there’s been a lot of random content being created, with people experimenting with AI to record and publish things, but thoughtful reflection is becoming increasingly scarce. Moving forward, it would be beneficial to slightly control the output of this section and consolidate it into a monthly magazine format – releasing one article per month would suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feels like a sort of aftereffect or side effect; efficiency has increased, but the depth and breadth of thought have declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;efficiency-boost-undeniable&#34;&gt;Efficiency Boost: Undeniable
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Seven-Second Fish Sightseeing” column used to be poorly maintained, with only a few hot events covered. Due to laziness, I hadn’t searched the internet for relevant materials or compiled records. Now that various AI tools are available, all it takes is outlining the key points, and AI can automatically search for related events, generate articles as needed, simply format them, and publish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like a blessing for lazy people – efficiency has increased significantly, almost to the point of doubling efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond writing articles, efficiency gains are real when coding. Previously, writing code often required detailed reading of API interface documentation. Now, I can skip this entirely. This is incredibly valuable because familiarizing oneself with APIs is “physical labor,” not “mental labor.” AI handles this part perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spam-content&#34;&gt;Spam Content
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many articles have poor quality content, not to say that there’s nothing there; it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t read well, lacking a sense of reality and what people actually experience. It’s a style I didn’t enjoy before – like chewing wax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From another perspective, AI-generated content really does feel like products of a流水线 (liú shuǐ liàn - assembly line) production, lacking soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Era Internet Spam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forgetting&#34;&gt;Forgetting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of document is entirely AI-generated, and the reader’s context is unclear. However, over time, my own impressions will become blurred, or even forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar issues occur when writing code – without reviewing commit records, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember how I originally thought about it, or why I wrote it that way. This is particularly evident with code generated through repeated communication with AI, where the final code differs significantly from the initial ideas, sometimes drastically so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;search&#34;&gt;Search
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the number of times I’ve opened Google and Baidu has noticeably decreased. Many questions are now being answered by AI for searching and interaction, and the results are much better than traditional search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s mourn the &lt;code&gt;bing ai&lt;/code&gt;, which may no longer be active, a pioneering AI tool from a major company that could connect to the internet and search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using Google less, and the number of times I visit &lt;code&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/code&gt; has decreased as well. Many questions are now simply asked of AI – this website is gradually being phased out by the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My maintained blog, originally with very little traffic, is now even less expected of; it’s primarily a place for self-reflection and recording.&lt;/p&gt;
