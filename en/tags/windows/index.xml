        <description>&lt;p&gt;“I’d gotten used to using zsh on Linux, and when I was writing a blog post the other day, I suddenly realized that PowerShell 7 also supports persistent command-line prediction views, so I tried it out. It turned out to be pretty useful after all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I did to enable this feature, but it just appeared—that’s all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
e&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;powershell-7-a-powerful-tool-across-platforms&#34;&gt;PowerShell 7: A Powerful Tool Across Platforms
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;cross-platform-features&#34;&gt;Cross-Platform Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 breaks down platform limitations, allowing you to perform enterprise-level server management on Windows systems, system administration in Linux environments, or daily development tasks on macOS – all with a unified PowerShell 7 tool. This significantly increases productivity and reduces the learning curve and operational complexity associated with platform differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;powerful-features&#34;&gt;Powerful Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It possesses powerful scripting capabilities, supporting object-oriented programming, functions, modules, and other advanced programming features. Through PowerShell 7, users can easily operate the file system, create, delete, copy, move, and perform other operations on files and folders; it can access and modify the registry to deeply adjust system configurations; it can manage processes and services to effectively monitor and control the system&amp;rsquo;s running status. Furthermore, PowerShell 7 can interact with various Windows and non-Windows technologies, such as user and permission management in Active Directory and resource allocation and management on the Azure cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-source-ecosystem&#34;&gt;Open Source Ecosystem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 is open source, a feature that allows developers and enthusiasts worldwide to actively participate in its development and improvement. A large number of open-source modules and tools are constantly emerging, enriching the functionality and application scenarios of PowerShell 7. Users can find suitable modules within the open-source community to extend the capabilities of PowerShell 7 or contribute their own code to drive the overall development of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compatibility-and-stability&#34;&gt;Compatibility and Stability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell 7 maintains compatibility with older versions of PowerShell while introducing many new features and improvements. These enhancements not only improve performance but also increase stability, allowing users to complete various tasks more smoothly and reducing disruptions caused by software failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enable-command-line-prediction-view&#34;&gt;Enable Command-Line Prediction View
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the many useful features of PowerShell 7, the &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt; command is a practical tool that enhances the user&amp;rsquo;s command-line input experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the command itself isn’t necessary to achieve auto-completion, it only provides in-line completion; once enabled, it allows for prediction view, displaying all possible completion options in a list format. Users can then select the desired option using the up and down arrow keys, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of command input.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;methods-to-make-commands-persistent&#34;&gt;Methods to Make Commands Persistent
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure that the &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt; command takes effect every time PowerShell starts, we can add it to PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s profile. A PowerShell profile is a special script that automatically executes its commands when PowerShell launches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;determine-configuration-file-path&#34;&gt;Determine Configuration File Path
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In PowerShell, we can use the &lt;code&gt;$PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; variable to view the path of the configuration file. If the file does not exist under that path, users can manually create one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34;&gt;echo $PROFILE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-configuration-file&#34;&gt;Open Configuration File
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a text editor, such as the powerful Notepad++ or the lightweight Visual Studio Code, to open the file corresponding to the configuration file path obtained through the &lt;code&gt;$PROFILE&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-command&#34;&gt;Add Command
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the opened configuration file, add the command &lt;code&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView&lt;/code&gt;. Ensure that the command is written accurately to guarantee that the configuration file takes effect correctly when executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;save-configuration&#34;&gt;Save Configuration
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adding the command, save the configuration file and close the text editor. At this point, the configuration file contains the commands we want to execute every time PowerShell starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;verification-settings&#34;&gt;Verification Settings
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the current PowerShell window and restart PowerShell. In the newly launched PowerShell, when entering commands, the command-line input prediction view style should already be displayed in list view according to our settings, indicating that our settings have been successfully applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these steps, we not only gained a deeper understanding of the powerful features and characteristics of PowerShell 7 but also learned how to use the command-line input prediction view style to enhance the user experience, and how to make these settings persistent. We hope this knowledge can help you operate PowerShell 7 more confidently and efficiently complete various system management and automation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Desktop hardware three-in-one, in the previous text we mentioned PCIe adapter for solid state drives, where did the old SSDs go? Of course there was no waste, were any of them broken, disassembled and installed on the newly purchased ‘MechMaker Mini-3765H’ (bought a year ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new machine has powerful hardware specifications: 2.5G dual network interface, PCIe4.0, WiFi6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently moved house and my room doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a dedicated router for networking, all the machines are connected via wireless network; the ASUS motherboard desktop wireless card performance wasn’t great, or perhaps it was the router’s wireless access, which resulted in slow upload speeds between local networks, leading to poor network speeds between the machines. I purchased a 2.5G NIC and installed it on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus, all the slots on the motherboard are now full: graphics card, wireless card, 2.5G NIC, PCIe adapter for solid state drives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;network-instructions&#34;&gt;Network Instructions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both machines connect to the internet using their original wireless network cards, but are directly connected via Ethernet cables between the two, with both ends equipped with 2.5G network cards.  The specifics of how to physically connect the cables aren&amp;rsquo;t detailed here – numerous tutorials are available online; just remember to disable your firewall. You can select either machine as the gateway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ASUS Z490 motherboard has too many disks, resulting in intermittent disk unrecognition.</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/asus-z490-motherboard-disk-recognition-issues/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 00:08:51 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/asus-z490-motherboard-disk-recognition-issues/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the previous text, an issue suddenly arose where the wireless network card was unable to be recognized. Before rebuilding the partitions, I had also researched other solutions online, such as: removing the motherboard battery and disconnecting power for fifteen minutes; upgrading to the latest version of the BOIS driver, but all attempts were unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking there were still tasks to complete, I switched to a limited network by pulling a web across from the living room into the room. However, this is when the problem returned – wired networking was also unable to be recognized. I then resorted to the ultimate solution of reinstalling the system, which resulted in partition loss during the boot process. If the issue had consistently occurred, I wouldn’t have spent so long troubleshooting it; the ASUS disk conflict is intermittent and triggered by unstable system restarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I purchased a new 2TB solid-state drive from长江存储 (Jiangang Chengsu – Yangtze Storage) with an M.2 interface, and the machine never rebooted until yesterday when I shut it down once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reinstalling-the-system&#34;&gt;Reinstalling the System
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost two years since I last reinstalled the system, and my C drive is completely full. Windows keeps throwing old issues, and various software likes to store things on C: Drive. So, I decided to reinstall the system. After reinstalling the system, the network card issue was resolved, and I restored my daily development environment the next day. While preparing to create a system backup, a new problem arose: after restarting the system, the boot partition disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the steps in the previous article, I rebuilt the boot partition; however, it wasn’t stable, and the partition would frequently fail to load upon restart. I started to wonder if the chassis was being tampered with when I realized that the hard drive cable was loose, but after several checks, there were no issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;memory-retrieval&#34;&gt;Memory Retrieval
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, this machine had once been equipped with a solid-state drive; it was like buying a new PCIE converter (plugged into the graphics card slot) instead of directly installing the hard drive onto the motherboard. This time, it’s installed directly on the motherboard, which may be due to an issue with the motherboard.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;motherboard-manual&#34;&gt;Motherboard Manual
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motherboard manual has issues, with the labeled SATA port positions differing from the actual positions. Due to a large number of disks, all ports are populated with hard drives, with older SSDs utilizing SATA ports. According to the manual, there is a conflict between the ports. However, after testing, this conflict was found to be unstable and would trigger, causing the corresponding disk to fail to load – specifically, as it’s the system disk, the bootloader is also located on that disk, resulting in boot loader failure during system startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions&#34;&gt;Solutions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinstall the solid state drive onto a PCIe adapter, at this point, the SATA ports on the motherboard will no longer conflict and the system starts normally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Uncovering the Mysteries of ESP Partitions, GPT Partitions Table, and the Synergy with Windows Operating Systems</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/esp-partitioning-gpt-windows-cooperation/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 23:58:20 +0800</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday after finishing work, I followed the usual routine of booting up my desktop computer. The system started normally but couldn&amp;rsquo;t load the wireless network card. I thought it might be loose, so I disassembled the computer and reinstalled the wireless network card. That’s when things went really wrong – the system simply wouldn’t start, and the bootloader failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a long time since I’d messed around with a desktop computer, and I was a little unfamiliar with partitioning and booting. Using DisGenius, I repartitioned a blank partition (usually partitioned to the beginning of the disk) and allocated it as an ESP partition (defaulting to 300M). I then entered PE system to rebuild the boot, and relevant information could be found online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of computer storage, the ESP partition, GPT partition table, and Windows operating system are closely linked, each playing a unique and crucial role in supporting the stable operation and efficient management of the system. However, before delving into them, we must mention “前辈” – MBR partition table format, which reflects with later technologies, highlighting the evolution of technology. Today, let’s delve into their internal connection and subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-mbr-partition-table--the-foundation-of-traditional-hard-disk-partitioning&#34;&gt;I. MBR Partition Table – The “Foundation” of Traditional Hard Disk Partitioning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;MBR, which stands for Master Boot Record, has existed since the early days of personal computers and has dominated the hard disk partitioning landscape for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-basic-architecture&#34;&gt;1. Basic Architecture
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is located in the first sector of the hard disk, which is sector 0, occupying 512 bytes of space. These 512 bytes are primarily divided into three parts: firstly, the boot program code, responsible for loading the operating system&amp;rsquo;s boot loader during computer startup, typically 446 bytes; secondly, the disk partition table, occupying 64 bytes, which can define up to 4 main partitions, with each partition describing 16 bytes of information, recording the starting head, sector, and cylinder of the partition, as well as key parameters such as partition type and size; and finally, the last 2 bytes are the MBR end marker &amp;ldquo;55 AA&amp;rdquo;, used to identify this sector as a valid MBR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-historical-achievements-and-limitations&#34;&gt;2. Historical Achievements and Limitations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days, MBR partition tables fully met the storage needs of relatively simple personal computers. It allowed operating systems to seamlessly recognize hard disk partitions, enabling orderly data storage and retrieval. However, as times evolved, its limitations became increasingly apparent. Firstly, limited by a 64-byte partition table space, it could only define a maximum of 4 primary partitions; creating more partitions required the use of extended partitions and logical partitions – methods that were somewhat complex and added to the difficulty of disk management. Secondly, its maximum support was only 2TB of hard drives, which seemed inadequate in the face of today’s large-capacity drives routinely measuring several TB or even tens of TB. This became a bottleneck hindering further development of storage technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-esp-partition--the-systems-invisible-boot-key&#34;&gt;II. ESP Partition – The System’s “Invisible Boot Key”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESP, which stands for EFI System Partition, is a special partition required by computers based on the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-functional-features&#34;&gt;1. Functional Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boot Loading:&lt;/strong&gt; When the computer starts up, UEFI firmware first searches for the ESP partition on the hard drive and reads the boot loader (such as Windows Boot Manager) stored within it, thereby launching the operating system. This is like a precise key that opens the door to system startup; without it, the system would be lost and confused during startup, not knowing where to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage Driver:&lt;/strong&gt; The ESP partition also stores some driver programs necessary for the system boot process, ensuring that hardware devices (such as hard disk controllers, graphics cards, etc.) function normally in the early stages of booting, laying a foundation for the smooth takeover of the operating system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-space-requirements-and-formatting&#34;&gt;2. Space Requirements and Formatting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, ESP partition sizes should range from 100MB to 500MB, with an allocation of around 200MB generally sufficient for basic needs. Its file system format must be FAT32, as UEFI firmware can only recognize FAT32 formatting to read boot files, ensuring compatibility and cross-platform support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-gpt-partition-table--the-hard-drives-smart-manager&#34;&gt;Three. GPT Partition Table – The Hard Drive’s “Smart Manager”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT (GUID Partition Table), also known as the Globally Unique Identifier Partition Table, is a new partitioning scheme designed to replace the traditional MBR partition table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-advantages-demonstrated&#34;&gt;1. Advantages Demonstrated
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Capacity Support:&lt;/strong&gt; In today’s era of data explosion, large-capacity hard drives are emerging one after another. GPT partition tables break the MBR&amp;rsquo;s 2TB capacity limit, theoretically enabling support for up to 9.4ZB (zettabytes – 1ZB = 1024 EB, 1EB = 1024 PB, 1PB = 1024 TB) of ultra-large storage space, providing possibilities for storing massive amounts of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numerous Partition Numbers:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike MBR which can only partition a maximum of 4 primary partitions, GPT allows the creation of up to 128 partitions, giving users and system administrators great flexibility whether it’s partitioning multiple system partitions, data partitions, or reserving partitions for special purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Reliability:&lt;/strong&gt; The GPT partition table employs redundancy backup mechanisms, storing information about the partition table in both the head and tail of the hard drive. When one partition table fails, the system can automatically restore from the other backup, greatly reducing the risk of data loss due to partition table failures, ensuring data security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-structural-analysis&#34;&gt;2. Structural Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GPT partition table consists of multiple components, including a protected MBR (maintained as a small portion of the traditional BIOS structure for compatibility with legacy BIOS and not used for actual partition management), a GPT header (storing basic information about the GPT partition table such as partition table version, number of partitions, partition table size, etc.), and a partition entry array (each partition entry details key information such as the starting sector, ending sector, partition type GUID, and unique identifier for each partition). These structures work together to precisely plan and manage disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-windows-operating-system--the-users-digital-interaction-heaven&#34;&gt;Four. Windows Operating System – The User’s “Digital Interaction Heaven”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows, as the world’s most widely used operating system, builds a friendly bridge between people and computer hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-fusion-of-esp-and-gpt-partition-tables&#34;&gt;1. Fusion of ESP and GPT Partition Tables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Windows system installation based on UEFI booting, the installer automatically creates an ESP (Extensible Firmware Interface) partition and deploys boot files to it. Simultaneously, the hard drive is initialized with a GPT (GUID Partition Table) partition scheme, dividing it into system reserved partitions (used for storing critical system files, similar to the system boot file area in traditional BIOS), Windows system partitions (where the core system files are installed), and other user-defined data partitions. The Windows system relies on the GPT partition table to precisely identify each partition, enabling seamless booting through the ESP partition, and ensuring a smooth boot and usage experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-system-management-and-optimization-based-on&#34;&gt;2. System Management and Optimization Based on
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During operation, Windows fully utilizes the advantages of the GPT partition table for disk management. For example, in the Disk Management tool, it can easily identify GPT partitions, allowing users to create, delete, format, and adjust partition sizes – meeting different data storage needs at various stages. Furthermore, processes such as system updates and software installations are closely related to partition layouts.  A rational partition plan helps improve system performance and stability, and reduces issues caused by insufficient disk space or partition confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v-practical-tips-maintenance-and-troubleshooting&#34;&gt;V. Practical Tips: Maintenance and Troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you understand their close relationship, daily maintenance and troubleshooting have a clear path to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-disk-space-management&#34;&gt;1. Disk Space Management
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly check ESP partition space to avoid running out of space due to installing too many startup-related software, which can affect system boot. For data partitions under GPT partitions, plan storage appropriately, promptly clean up unnecessary files, and prevent a single partition from filling up to impact system operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-troubleshooting-startup-failures&#34;&gt;2. Troubleshooting Startup Failures
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you encounter a system that cannot start, first check if the ESP (Extensible Partition Table) partition is damaged or files are missing. You can use the startup repair tool built into the UEFI firmware, or enter the Windows recovery environment using an installation media to rebuild the boot files of the ESP partition. If you suspect a GPT (GUID Partition Table) partition table failure, use a professional disk utility (such as DiskGenius) to check the integrity of the partition table and attempt to repair it by restoring backup partition information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ESP partition, GPT partition table, and Windows operating system are like a precise team working together, each playing its own role to create a stable and efficient computer usage environment for us. Understanding them deeply not only helps us handle system installation and maintenance with confidence, but also allows us to understand the underlying logic of computer operation and explore the digital world. At the same time, reflecting on the rise and fall of the MBR (Master Boot Record) partition table reminds us of the power of technological progress, which has driven storage technology to continuously advance to meet the growing data storage needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Windows Built-in Disk Cleanup Tool: Storage</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-disk-cleanup-storage/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2025 19:29:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-disk-cleanup-storage/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure from what version it started, but in &lt;code&gt;Windows 11&lt;/code&gt;, the Disk Cleanup tool has been significantly improved and become much smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is that it&amp;rsquo;s an official tool, so it won’t accidentally delete files, won’t have ads, won’t have pop-ups, won’t have background processes, or any unnecessary elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access the Disk Cleanup tool in &lt;code&gt;Windows 11&lt;/code&gt; by going to &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Storage &amp;gt; Temporary Files&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ordinary users, simply selecting “Clean up” is sufficient; the system will provide suggestions based on your usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I have many temporary files on my disk, so I choose “Temporary Files,” which contains items like &lt;code&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/code&gt; temporary files and &lt;code&gt;Windows Update&lt;/code&gt; temporary files, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quickly calculate folder size on the Windows platform</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-platform-quick-folder-size-statistics/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 19:54:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/windows-platform-quick-folder-size-statistics/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Linux platform is very simple: &lt;code&gt;du -sh *&lt;/code&gt; – just one line of code solves the problem. What about Windows? With many disks and a desire to clean up, with numerous files, the system’s built-in Resource Manager is too slow to calculate folder sizes, making you want to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;everything&#34;&gt;Everything
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For developers working on the &lt;code&gt;windows&lt;/code&gt; platform, you probably haven&amp;rsquo;t personally used &lt;code&gt;everything&lt;/code&gt;, and should at least have heard of it. Its search speed far exceeds that of the built-in file explorer. Given that system-level support for fast indexing exists, we can certainly find similar tools that build file indexes while also calculating file sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

Use the standard installation method or the green version to unzip and run.
It’s fast, with a wide variety of data display types – the left side features a tree diagram mode, the right side displays file types, and there&amp;rsquo;s also graphical visualization available at the bottom of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operation is very simple – select the corresponding drive letter, and the software will display folder sizes in a graphical way, with larger volumes resulting in larger matrices in the images.  Other operations are easily understood by simply clicking on them. It supports inputting filter conditions for files:&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai GuoAn database incident, which caused a huge stir within the black hacking circles, remains unclear whether it’s true or false. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what we remember in two years and look back on it then. Based on past experience, I updated a batch of local social engineering databases, and I encountered a massive SQL file: 17.9G. A regular text editor couldn&amp;rsquo;t even preview it, let alone open it. Chatting with netizens, someone mentioned EmEditor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Text

    &gt;https://www.emeditor.com/&lt;/a&gt;
I took a look at it over the weekend and found it quite convenient. The design supports editing large files, and when sufficient memory is available, the entire file is loaded into memory, resulting in fast search and editing speeds. It also supports splitting files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
