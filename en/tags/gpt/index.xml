        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday after work, I got home and turned on my desktop as usual. The system booted up normally, but the wireless network card failed to load. I thought the card might have come loose, so I opened the case and reinstalled it. That&amp;rsquo;s when things went wrong – the system wouldn’t boot at all; the bootloader failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I messed with desktop computers, so partitioning is a bit unfamiliar. I used DisGenius to create a new blank partition (usually partitioned towards the front of the disk) and allocated it as an ESP partition (default 300M). Then, I rebuilt the boot in the PE system. You can find relevant information online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create New ESP Partition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can remove MSR partition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of computer storage, ESP partitions, GPT partition tables, and Windows operating systems are closely linked, each playing a unique and crucial role, jointly supporting the stable operation and efficient management of the system. However, before delving into them, it is necessary to mention the &amp;ldquo;predecessor&amp;rdquo; in the long history of computer partitioning—the MBR partition table format. It reflects the evolution of technology by contrasting with later technologies. Today, let&amp;rsquo;s deeply analyze their inherent connections and subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-mbr-partition-table--the-foundation-of-traditional-disk-partitioning&#34;&gt;I. MBR Partition Table – The &amp;ldquo;Foundation&amp;rdquo; of Traditional Disk Partitioning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;MBR, which stands for Master Boot Record, has existed since the early days of personal computers and has dominated the hard drive partitioning field for decades&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;basic-architecture&#34;&gt;Basic architecture
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is located in the first sector of the hard drive, also known as sector 0, and occupies 512 bytes. These 512 bytes are mainly divided into three parts: firstly, the boot program code, which is responsible for loading the operating system&amp;rsquo;s boot loader when the computer starts up, typically occupying 446 bytes; secondly, the disk partition table, occupying 64 bytes, which can define a maximum of 4 primary partition entries, each entry occupying 16 bytes and recording key parameters such as the starting head, sector, cylinder, and type and size of the partition; finally, the last 2 bytes are the MBR termination flag &amp;ldquo;55 AA&amp;rdquo;, used to identify this sector as a valid MBR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;historical-achievements-and-limitations&#34;&gt;Historical achievements and limitations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the MBR partition table fully met the relatively simple storage needs of personal computers. It allowed operating systems to smoothly recognize hard drive partitions and implement orderly data storage and retrieval. However, as times evolved, its limitations became increasingly apparent. On one hand, limited by the 64-byte space of the partition table, it could only support a maximum of four primary partitions. To create more partitions, complex methods such as extended partitions and logical partitions were required, which brought inconvenience to disk management; on the other hand, it supported a maximum hard drive capacity of only 2TB, which seemed inadequate in the face of high-capacity drives that are now often several TB or even tens of TB, becoming a bottleneck restricting further development of storage technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-esp-partition--the-systems-invisible-boot-key&#34;&gt;II. ESP Partition – The System&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Invisible Boot Key&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESP, which stands for EFI System Partition, is a special partition required by computers based on the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) standard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The boot process: When the computer is powered on, the UEFI firmware first searches for the ESP partition on the hard drive and reads the boot loader stored there (such as Windows Boot Manager), then starts the operating system. It&amp;rsquo;s like a precise key that opens the door to system startup; without it, the system will be lost and confused at startup, not knowing where to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The storage drive also stores some drivers essential for the system startup process, ensuring that hardware devices such as hard disk controllers and graphics cards function properly during the early boot phase, laying the foundation for the subsequent smooth takeover by the operating system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;space-requirements-and-format&#34;&gt;Space requirements and format
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, the recommended size for the ESP partition is between 100MB and 500MB, and allocating around 200MB is usually sufficient to meet basic needs. Its file system format must be FAT32 because UEFI firmware can only recognize FAT32 when reading boot files, ensuring compatibility and cross-platform support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-gpt-partition-table--the-smart-manager-of-your-hard-drive&#34;&gt;III. GPT Partition Table – The &amp;ldquo;Smart Manager&amp;rdquo; of Your Hard Drive
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT (GUID Partition Table), also known as a Global Unique Identifier Partition Table, is a new partitioning scheme designed to replace traditional MBR partition tables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advantages-revealed&#34;&gt;Advantages revealed
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Capacity Support:&lt;/strong&gt; In today&amp;rsquo;s era of data explosion, high-capacity hard drives are constantly emerging. The GPT partition table breaks through the 2TB capacity limitation of MBR and theoretically supports up to 9.4ZB (Zettabytes, 1 ZB = 1024 EB, 1 EB = 1024 PB, 1 PB = 1024 TB) of extremely large storage space, making it possible to store massive amounts of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike MBR, which can only have a maximum of four primary partitions, GPT allows for the creation of up to 128 partitions, providing users and system administrators with great flexibility. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s partitioning multiple system partitions, data partitions, or reserving partitions for special purposes, it handles everything smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High reliability: The GPT partition table utilizes a redundant backup mechanism, storing partition information in both the head and tail of the hard drive. When one partition table is damaged, the system can automatically recover from another backup, significantly reducing the risk of data loss due to partition table failures and safeguarding data security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;structural-analysis&#34;&gt;Structural Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GPT partition table consists of several parts, including a protective MBR (retained for compatibility with traditional BIOS as a small portion of the MBR structure but not used for actual partitioning management), a GPT header (which stores basic information about the GPT partition table, such as the partition table version, number of partitions, and partition table size), and an array of partition entries (each partition entry details key information such as the starting sector, ending sector, partition type GUID, and unique partition identifier). These structures work together to precisely plan and manage disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-windows-operating-system--a-digital-interaction-realm-for-users&#34;&gt;Four, Windows Operating System – A “Digital Interaction Realm” for Users
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows, as a globally widely used operating system, builds a friendly bridge between people and computer hardware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;integration-with-esp-partitions-and-gpt-partition-tables&#34;&gt;Integration with ESP partitions and GPT partition tables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Windows installation process on systems booting based on UEFI, the installer automatically creates an ESP (EFI System Partition) and deploys boot files within it. At the same time, the hard drive is initialized with a GPT (GUID Partition Table), partitioning out a system reserved partition (used to store system critical files, similar to the system boot file area in traditional BIOS), a Windows system partition (where the system core files are installed), and other user-defined data partitions. The Windows system relies on the GPT partition table to accurately identify each partition, smoothly booting through the ESP partition, with seamless integration between the three, providing users with a smooth startup and usage experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reliance-on-system-management-and-optimization&#34;&gt;Reliance on system management and optimization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows leverages the advantages of the GPT partition table for disk management during operation. For example, in the Disk Management tool, GPT partitions can be easily recognized, allowing users to conveniently create, delete, format partitions, and adjust their sizes, meeting data storage needs at different stages. Furthermore, system updates, software installations, and other processes are closely related to the partition layout; a reasonable partitioning scheme helps improve system performance and stability, reducing problems caused by insufficient disk space or partition confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;v-practical-tips-maintenance-and-troubleshooting&#34;&gt;V. Practical Tips: Maintenance and Troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding their close relationship makes troubleshooting and maintenance more systematic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disk-space-management&#34;&gt;Disk space management
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly check the ESP partition space to avoid issues caused by insufficient space due to installing too many startup items or related software, which can affect system boot. For data partitions under GPT partitioning, plan storage reasonably and promptly clean up unnecessary files to prevent a single partition from becoming full and affecting system operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;troubleshooting-startup-issues&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting startup issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the system fails to start, first check if the ESP partition is damaged or files are missing. You can use the startup repair tool built into the UEFI firmware, or enter the recovery environment through a Windows installation medium to rebuild the boot files of the ESP partition. If you suspect a GPT partition table failure, use professional disk tools (such as DiskGenius) to check the integrity of the partition table and attempt to repair and restore backup partition information to recover lost partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESP partitions, GPT partition tables, and the Windows operating system are like a precise team working together, each playing their part to create a stable and efficient computing environment for us. A deep understanding of them not only helps us feel confident during system installation and maintenance but also allows us to understand the underlying logic of computer operation and freely explore the digital world. At the same time, reflecting on the rise and fall of the MBR partition table further reminds us of the power of technological progress, which drives storage technology forward to adapt to the ever-increasing demand for data storage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
