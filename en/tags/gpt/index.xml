        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, after work, I got home and turned on my desktop. The system booted normally, but the wireless network card failed to load. Thinking the card might be loose, I opened the case and reinstalled it. This made things much worse; now the system won&amp;rsquo;t boot at all, and the bootloader has failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I worked with desktop computers, so partitioning feels a bit unfamiliar. I used DisGenius to create a new blank partition (usually at the beginning of the disk) and allocated it as an ESP partition (defaulting to 300M). Then, I rebuilt the boot from within the PE system. Relevant information can be found online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of computer storage, ESP partitions, GPT partition tables, and Windows operating systems are closely linked, each playing a unique and crucial role in supporting stable system operation and efficient management. Before delving into them, however, it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to mention the &amp;ldquo;pioneer&amp;rdquo; in the history of computer partitioning – the MBR partition table format. It reflects the evolution of technology by contrasting with later innovations. Today, let’s explore their intrinsic connections and intricacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mbr-partition-table--the-foundation-of-traditional-disk-partitioning&#34;&gt;MBR Partition Table – The &amp;ldquo;Foundation&amp;rdquo; of Traditional Disk Partitioning
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;MBR, short for Master Boot Record, has existed since the early days of personal computers and dominated the hard drive partitioning field for decades&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;basic-architecture&#34;&gt;Basic architecture
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is located in the first sector of the hard drive, also known as sector 0, and occupies 512 bytes. These 512 bytes are primarily divided into three parts: firstly, the boot program code, responsible for loading the operating system&amp;rsquo;s boot loader during computer startup, typically 446 bytes; secondly, the disk partition table, occupying 64 bytes, which can define up to 4 primary partition entries, each entry using 16 bytes to record parameters such as starting head, sector, cylinder, and partition type and size; finally, the last 2 bytes are the MBR termination flag &amp;ldquo;55 AA&amp;rdquo;, used to identify this sector as a valid MBR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;historical-achievements-and-limitations&#34;&gt;Historical achievements and limitations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the MBR partition table adequately met the relatively simple storage needs of personal computers. It allowed operating systems to smoothly recognize hard drive partitions for orderly data storage and retrieval. However, as technology evolved, its limitations became increasingly apparent. On one hand, constrained by a 64-byte partition table space, it could only support a maximum of four primary partitions; creating more required the use of extended and logical partitions, adding complexity to disk management. On the other hand, with a maximum capacity of only 2TB, it struggled to keep pace with today&amp;rsquo;s high-capacity drives—often several terabytes or even dozens—becoming a bottleneck for further storage technology development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;esp-partition--the-systems-invisible-boot-key&#34;&gt;ESP Partition – The System&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Invisible Boot Key&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESP, short for EFI System Partition, is a special partition required on computers using the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) standard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a computer powers on, the UEFI firmware first locates the ESP partition on the hard drive and reads the boot loader stored there (such as Windows Boot Manager), thereby initiating the operating system. It&amp;rsquo;s like a precise key that unlocks the gateway to system startup; without it, the system would be lost and confused at boot time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ESP partition also stores essential drivers needed during system startup, ensuring that hardware devices (such as disk controllers and graphics cards) function correctly in the early boot phase, laying the foundation for the subsequent operating system to take over smoothly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;space-requirements-and-format&#34;&gt;Space requirements and format
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, the ESP partition is recommended to be between 100MB and 500MB; allocating around 200MB usually suffices for basic needs. Its file system format must be FAT32 because UEFI firmware can only recognize this format for reading boot files, ensuring compatibility and cross-platform support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gpt-partition-table--the-smart-manager-of-your-hard-drive&#34;&gt;GPT Partition Table – The &amp;ldquo;Smart Manager&amp;rdquo; of Your Hard Drive
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT (GUID Partition Table), or Global Unique Identifier Partition Table, is a new partitioning scheme designed to replace traditional MBR partition tables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advantages-revealed&#34;&gt;Advantages revealed
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s era of data explosion, high-capacity hard drives are constantly emerging. The GPT partition table overcomes the 2TB capacity limitation of MBR and theoretically supports up to 9.4 ZB (Zettabytes) – an extremely large storage space enabling massive data storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike MBR, which limits partitioning to a maximum of four primary partitions, GPT allows for up to 128 partitions, providing users and system administrators with great flexibility—whether it&amp;rsquo;s dividing multiple system or data partitions, or reserving partitions for specific purposes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GPT partition table utilizes a redundant backup mechanism, storing partition information in both the hard drive header and tail. This allows the system to automatically recover from another backup if one partition table is damaged, significantly reducing the risk of data loss due to partition table failure and ensuring data security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;structural-analysis&#34;&gt;Structural Analysis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GPT partition table consists of several parts, including a protective MBR (retained for BIOS compatibility but not used for actual partitioning), a GPT header (storing basic information about the partition table, such as version, number of partitions, and table size), and an array of partition entries (each entry detailing key information like start/end sectors, GUID type, and unique identifier). These structures work together to precisely plan and manage disk space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;windows-operating-system--a-digital-interaction-space-for-users&#34;&gt;Windows Operating System – A &amp;ldquo;Digital Interaction Space&amp;rdquo; for Users
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows, a widely used operating system worldwide, builds a user-friendly bridge between people and computer hardware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;integration-with-esp-partitions-and-gpt-partition-tables&#34;&gt;Integration with ESP partitions and GPT partition tables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Windows installation process on UEFI-based systems, the installer automatically creates an EFI System Partition (ESP) and deploys boot files to it. The hard drive is initialized with a GPT partition table, creating a system reserved partition (similar to the system boot file area in traditional BIOS), a Windows system partition (where core system files are installed), and other user-defined data partitions. Windows relies on the GPT partition table to accurately identify each partition, enabling smooth startup through the ESP, ensuring seamless integration for a fluid user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;system-management-and-optimization-foundation&#34;&gt;System management and optimization foundation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows leverages the advantages of GPT partition tables for disk management during operation. For example, the Disk Management tool can easily identify GPT partitions, allowing users to conveniently create, delete, format, and resize them – meeting diverse data storage needs at different stages. System updates, software installations, and other processes are also closely related to the partition layout; a well-planned partitioning scheme helps improve system performance and stability, reducing issues caused by insufficient disk space or partition confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practical-tips-maintenance-and-troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Practical Tips: Maintenance and Troubleshooting
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding their close relationship makes daily maintenance and troubleshooting much more systematic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disk-space-management&#34;&gt;Disk space management
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly check the ESP partition space to avoid issues caused by insufficient space due to excessive startup items or software installations, which can affect system boot. For data partitions under GPT, plan storage effectively and promptly clear unnecessary files to prevent full partitions from impacting system operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;troubleshoot-startup-issues&#34;&gt;Troubleshoot startup issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the system fails to boot, first check the ESP partition for corruption or missing files. You can use the UEFI firmware&amp;rsquo;s built-in startup repair tool or enter a Windows recovery environment using the installation media to rebuild the ESP partition’s boot files. If you suspect a GPT partition table failure, use professional disk tools (such as DiskGenius) to check the integrity of the partition table and attempt to repair/restore backup partition information to recover lost partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESP partitions, GPT partition tables, and the Windows operating system work like a precise team, each playing their part to create a stable and efficient computing environment. Understanding them not only helps us confidently install and maintain systems but also allows us to grasp the underlying logic of computers and navigate the digital world with ease. Reflecting on the rise and fall of the MBR partition table further highlights the power of technological progress, which drives storage technology forward to meet ever-increasing data storage demands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
