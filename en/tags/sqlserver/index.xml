        <description>&lt;p&gt;The company adjusted its security policies. Ultimately, ‘Mechanical Mini’ was relocated back home as a backup server, along with a full system reinstallation. Ubuntu switched to Windows Server; due to an irregular activation method – used at home – it seemed like it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be activated, and that was fine. An unconventional activation triggered Microsoft’s detection (running normally for half a month), the server would automatically shut down after running for one hour. After reviewing the system logs, it was discovered that this was due to using a pirated version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t much else to do, so the system was reinstalled again, and SQL Server also needed to be reinstalled – it&amp;rsquo;s always a bit frustrating. File permission management is strict, making it impossible to attach databases normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;error-message&#34;&gt;Error Message
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the system reinstallation, &lt;code&gt;SqlServer&lt;/code&gt; may encounter error 5120, an operating system access denied error, when attaching a database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;processing-script&#34;&gt;Processing Script
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous link: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ttf248.life/en/p/bulk-update-local-git-repository-and-legacy-permission-issues/&#34; &gt;Batch Update Local Git Repository&lt;/a&gt;, it’s that familiar script all over again – let&amp;rsquo;s modify it to iterate through folders while also changing file permissions, currently using full editing privileges.
Most online tutorials instruct you to manually modify files; they only need to change a few files each time? I have batches of files to process, and manually handling them would drive me crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
