        <title>The End of the Era of Wild Capitalism: The League of Legends Esports Era Concludes</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The esports industry has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, becoming a significant cultural phenomenon worldwide. Games like League of Legends (LOL) have not only provided players with competitive entertainment but also fueled capital investment, driving the development of various esports platforms and events. However, this trajectory is now entering a gradual decline alongside the influx of capital and the rise of the pan-entertainment industry. The rise and fall of Panda TV, as well as the competition between Douyu and Huya, mark the end of an era of &amp;ldquo;wild capitalism,&amp;rdquo; suggesting shifts in the favorable conditions for the esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-esports-and-capital-investment&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Esports and Capital Investment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early esports industry had humble beginnings, particularly in China. Many players participated in competitions for games like StarCraft and Dota fueled by their passion. However, esports truly began to rise with the release and promotion of League of Legends. After League of Legends officially entered the Chinese market in 2011, esports gradually evolved from a niche community into part of mainstream culture. Especially starting in 2013, the LPL (Chinese professional league) steadily developed, making League of Legends the cornerstone of China&amp;rsquo;s esports industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 marked a turning point for the esports industry in China. The influx of capital transformed esports from simple competitions into a much larger ecosystem. Panda TV, as one example, became a product of excess capital. Founded with investment from Wang Sicong, Panda TV rapidly gained popularity by attracting viewers and users with its innovative content and substantial investments. However, this also exemplified the &amp;ldquo;barbaric&amp;rdquo; influx of capital – a relentless pursuit that often lacks patience and long-term vision. While significant short-term achievements were made through considerable financial and human resources, Panda TV ultimately declared bankruptcy in 2019 due to management issues and overreliance on capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fall of Panda TV did not lead to a decline in the esports streaming industry, but rather spurred the rise of platforms like Douyu and Huya. These two giants quickly became leaders in the esports sector, with increasingly fierce competition between them. Douyu initially gained prominence through livestreaming League of Legends professional matches and signing top streamers, setting a benchmark for esports broadcasting. Huya, by increasing investment in esports events and diversifying its platform, gradually narrowed the gap with Douyu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital played a significant role in this process. Bilibili successfully went public in 2018, and Huya also conducted an IPO that same year. The rapid flow of capital led to high industry concentration and intense competition between platforms for streamers and copyrights, resulting in a &amp;ldquo;capital war.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-convergence-of-pan-entertainment-and-esports&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Convergence of Pan-Entertainment and Esports
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With increased investment in the esports industry, esports platforms are gradually diversifying their content. Esports hosts are expanding beyond game commentary and event streaming to include various entertainment formats such as singing, dancing, and interactive live streams. This has resulted in a richer content ecosystem centered around esports but incorporating diverse entertainment elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the trend towards broad entertainment has brought problems—the originally focused gaming culture of esports is gradually being marginalized, replaced by a trend prioritizing entertainment above all else. This shift has caused some viewers who were deeply passionate about esports culture to feel alienated, and capital is increasingly turning its attention to other entertainment sectors. Excessive investment and profit-seeking are blurring the essence of the esports industry, weakening the core value proposition centered on competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rise of short video platforms, live streaming platforms, and other pan-entertainment industries, capital has gradually shifted funds from esports to broader entertainment content. Consequently, giants like Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance are no longer solely reliant on esports projects for profit but have increased investment in areas such as film, music, and short videos. Notably, ByteDance&amp;rsquo;s rise, fueled by the explosive growth of platforms like Douyin, has overshadowed esports’ prominence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-3-league-of-legends-generational-shift-the-fading-era-of-dividends&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: League of Legends&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Generational Shift&amp;rdquo;: The Fading Era of Dividends
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since League of Legends entered the Chinese market in 2011, it has become synonymous with the esports industry, fostering countless professional players, teams, and events, and driving a massive esports ecosystem. However, over a decade later, as a leading project in Chinese esports, League of Legends is entering a stage of generational transition. Notably, its influence has been gradually declining in recent years, even showing signs of significant decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
The most noticeable change is a generational shift in the player base. Initially, esports&amp;rsquo; rapid growth was fueled by a large cohort of young players, many of whom became professional players or viewers thanks to League of Legends. This generation grew up during a period of &amp;ldquo;demographic dividend,&amp;rdquo; immersed in the game’s competitive appeal and driving industry expansion. However, as time passed, these players matured, entered society, and shifted their focus towards other aspects of life and careers. Simultaneously, younger generations show less enthusiasm for League of Legends, resulting in an evident age gap and declining interest within the esports audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!
Despite numerous updates and revisions, League of Legends&amp;rsquo; content innovation is struggling to keep pace. Annual version updates, hero balance adjustments, and the introduction of new gameplay features have failed to fundamentally address players’ need for novelty. Simultaneously, the MOBA market is becoming saturated, and other game genres like Honor of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite have rapidly gained popularity, diverting a significant number of players away from League of Legends. This competitive landscape has left League of Legends perpetually in a “chaser” role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-what-is-the-future-of-the-esports-industry&#34;&gt;Conclusion: What is the future of the esports industry?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The esports industry is like a skyscraper that seemingly sprung up overnight. Excessive capital wanders within the internet sector, seeking the next opportunity, and esports has become one of their targets. Leveraging China&amp;rsquo;s demographic dividend, the industry achieved rapid success, but this success lacks a solid foundation. Over-investment in capital, talent shortages, and weak game content are all hindering healthy development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before college, I didn&amp;rsquo;t play many games. League of Legends accompanied a generation’s growth; I watched so many finals. As an outsider, comparing Chinese and Korean players—especially Faker—Chinese players always felt hesitant during major tournaments. I understand the psychological pressure on players, but after more than ten years of development in this industry, mental health should be prioritized by teams. However, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been, and gameplay still relies on players’ innate talent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>From Games to Family: Why We Gradually Drift Away from Virtual Worlds as We Grow Up</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 07:11:05 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/from-games-to-family-why-we-drift-away-from-virtual-worlds/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What were the happiest times playing games – sneaking to play Tank Battle, Super Mario, and Contra on our family&amp;rsquo;s TV as a child, or secretly playing Age of Empires on our family’s computer with my cousin, or later in college, playing Devil May Cry and League of Legends with my roommates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Childhood had no worries, and when you played, you were completely absorbed in it – a level of immersion that&amp;rsquo;s impossible to find again as an adult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As times change and society progresses, we who were once active in virtual worlds are gradually realizing that the game platform filled with joy and competition seems to be drifting away from our lives. The disconnection of game social links, accompanied by players&amp;rsquo; gradual departure, is not only due to technological advancements and the replacement of games themselves, but also because of a shift in our life’s focus. As we grow older, we become busy with marriage and having children, and the main thread of life gradually shifts from personal entertainment to family responsibilities. Today, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss the underlying reasons behind this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-disappearance-of-gaming-socialization-a-tug-of-war-between-virtual-and-real-worlds&#34;&gt;The Disappearance of Gaming Socialization: A Tug-of-War Between Virtual and Real Worlds
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many, games weren&amp;rsquo;t just entertainment during their youth; they were a social outlet. Popular online multiplayer games offered challenges and competition while connecting players worldwide, creating virtual communities. Playing dungeons and team battles with friends was part of life back then, as were late-night voice chats and sharing daily experiences – memories we cherish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with time, more and more players have found that this virtual social experience lacks lasting appeal. As games are updated and new platforms emerge, players increasingly find more interactive ways to socialize outside of gaming. In-game friendships gradually fade from view, and many previously active social connections within the game eventually dissolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;games-and-responsibility-a-shift-in-lifes-focus-after-adulthood&#34;&gt;Games and Responsibility: A Shift in Life&amp;rsquo;s Focus After Adulthood
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entering adulthood, responsibilities gradually increase. Many young people once invested significant time in games, but with the start of their careers or shared living/family formation, these previously essential leisure activities are squeezed by life&amp;rsquo;s obligations. Marriage, having children, and even caring for parents – these major responsibilities require choices regarding energy and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaming has become a thing of the past, replaced by the prioritization of family life. Many young people who once &amp;ldquo;struggled&amp;rdquo; in games are gradually realizing that real-life is the most important matter. Especially after having children, the focus of their lives shifts completely to family, and gaming is pushed to the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-games-to-family-how-changes-in-life-affect-our-entertainment-choices&#34;&gt;From Games to Family: How Changes in Life Affect Our Entertainment Choices
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our life experiences, family is one of the most important components. Once entering family life, time and energy become more specific and limited. To care for children and spend time with their partners, many young parents find they no longer have enough time to focus on games they once loved. Sometimes, they even lose interest in game updates and new releases. Gradually, social media platforms and offline interactions with friends and family become the preferred way for many people to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we’ve completely abandoned entertainment, but rather chosen ways more suitable for our current life stage. Many friends who used to connect through games may now maintain contact via other means—family gatherings, meals together, or short trips—due to diverging life paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;farewell-to-the-virtual-world-how-do-we-view-this-shift&#34;&gt;Farewell to the virtual world: How do we view this shift?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many who once immersed themselves in gaming, saying goodbye to game-related social connections isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. That virtual world, which brought us joy and a sense of accomplishment, has become part of our memories. However, farewell doesn’t mean severing ties completely; it means making different choices as life changes, balancing our roles in the real world. As we mature from youthful boys to responsible adults, while games still hold value, they can no longer be the main theme of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, this shift reflects a facet of human adaptability—our ability to adjust our focus and lifestyle according to different stages. When responsibilities and family become central to life, gaming socialization is no longer a priority but rather an occasional pastime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-games-may-usher-in-another-wave-of-sense-of-belonging&#34;&gt;Future games: may usher in another wave of &amp;ldquo;sense of belonging.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, with social development and technological advancements, the forms and content of games are constantly evolving. For example, modern online multiplayer games are increasingly moving towards more relaxed and flexible approaches, and some even prioritize family interaction and parent-child relationships. In the future, we may see more game formats that better integrate into family life and provide players with healthier, more balanced social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as many people still feel nostalgia and passion when talking about &amp;ldquo;childhood games,&amp;rdquo; perhaps we, in the future, will also unexpectedly revisit those past games, bringing new understanding and experience, and re-enter that virtual world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-is-changing-but-love-remains&#34;&gt;Life is changing, but love remains
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s games or family, life’s changes consistently accompany our growth. We gradually realize that while virtual worlds offer endless joy and excitement, we ultimately return to reality, to the warmest place – home. There’s no need to regret leaving games, as each stage of life has its own unique meaning. These changes are what make us more complete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The multifaceted nature of games: A convergence of psychological development and social entertainment</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2024 15:07:45 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/games-multidimensionality-psychological-development-social-entertainment-intersection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, gaming has evolved beyond a simple form of entertainment and become an integral part of daily life. From a psychological perspective, games play different roles in the mental development of people across various age groups and are closely linked to social interaction and recreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-state&#34;&gt;Mental state
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people are in a stage of exploring themselves and establishing their identity, therefore games can allow them to try on different roles and lives, satisfying curiosity and the desire for exploration. As they age, personal interests and values gradually stabilize, and games may no longer align with their life goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes&#34;&gt;Social attributes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, gaming has become a social activity, especially for young people. They make friends and build social networks through games, which serve as a bridge for socializing. However, as people age, their social circles stabilize and social needs may be met through more mature means, diminishing the role of gaming in socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-a-girl-out&#34;&gt;Taking a girl out
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, due to a lack of relationship education, children are pressured to focus solely on academics by their parents, then immediately pushed into relationships upon graduation—a very common phenomenon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lacking stable emotional relationships due to busy schedules, work commitments, or a lack of social skills can lead to feelings of loneliness and a desire for attention. &lt;strong&gt;However&lt;/strong&gt;, by helping and protecting female players, they experience a sense of being needed and valued, achieving emotional fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the game&amp;rsquo;s clear interaction rules and controllable environment offer certainty and a sense of security compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real life, reducing fears about unpredictable social interactions. However, prolonged reliance on virtual gratification within games may negatively impact their ability to form and maintain healthy emotional relationships in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reality-pressure&#34;&gt;Reality pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games offer a virtual world where players can temporarily escape the pressures, challenges, or unpleasant emotions of reality. This is particularly true for young people facing academic stress, family issues, or relationship difficulties, for whom games may be a way to seek comfort and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are often designed to provide players with a sense of accomplishment and recognition for completing tasks, leveling up, or defeating opponents. Young people may become addicted to games because they offer a feeling of being appreciated and acknowledged, which they may lack in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-getting-older-they-dont-like-playing-anymore&#34;&gt;After getting older, they don&amp;rsquo;t like playing anymore
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young, individuals face fewer social responsibilities and pressures, allowing more time and energy for gaming. As they enter the workforce and start families, increased responsibilities make time and energy more valuable, potentially leading to gaming being seen as a time sink rather than a preferred leisure activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, their cognitive abilities and interests evolve. What might appeal to someone in their youth—fast-paced, visually impressive games—may later give way to a preference for strategic, story-driven, or more complex experiences. If the market fails to meet these changing needs, interest will naturally decline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Game Psychology: Competitive Games</title>
        <link>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-esports/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 10:26:22 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://blog.ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-esports/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pay-to-win games are not discussed here. Within the gaming community, they&amp;rsquo;re commonly called &amp;ldquo;money warriors.&amp;rdquo; It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require understanding game mechanics, just a thick wallet. Their enjoyment comes from being surrounded by sycophants and the thrill of dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular competitive games like League of Legends, Dota 2, Honor of Kings, and PlayerUnknown&amp;rsquo;s Battlegrounds have established complete world-building and thriving esports ecosystems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In game design, psychology is a crucial field, and social psychology particularly so. Understanding people&amp;rsquo;s behavior, needs, and motivations can help create more engaging game experiences. Regarding the relationship between &amp;ldquo;showing off&amp;rdquo; (装逼) and social psychology, we can consider it from several perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often seek a sense of belonging within social groups. In games, if the design allows players to feel exceptional in some way and attract attention from others, it can enhance their social identity. This may manifest as showing off skills or displaying earned rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some games incorporate social competition elements, encouraging players to showcase their achievements on social networks. This can be achieved through leaderboards, achievement systems, or multiplayer battles. Such designs stimulate a competitive spirit among players and may lead some to perform exceptionally well for social recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some games allow players to express themselves through customized characters and virtual items. This self-expression is not just about showing off; it can also be a way to communicate individuality and socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some games emphasize teamwork, achieving game objectives through social interaction. In these contexts, showing off is often discouraged, with a focus on collaboration and mutual support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game design can incorporate psychological reward systems to encourage players&amp;rsquo; positive social behavior. For example, offering rewards or privileges to incentivize active participation in social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, social psychology in game design can be used to shape player interactions and social experiences. While &amp;ldquo;showing off&amp;rdquo; behavior may exist in certain situations, game designers typically strive to balance it to ensure a positive and engaging experience for all players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing as I think of things, without a complete outline—a bit messy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author frequently plays League of Legends, a game that represents the shared memories of our generation. Most parents disapprove of their children playing, often due to a lack of understanding and experience with this type of game – partly attributable to the game&amp;rsquo;s design, which offers a fresh start each match. For many children, it’s a self-directed exploration without excessive thought. Success or failure in this mode largely depends on the child&amp;rsquo;s innate gaming talent. Based on my own observations, a significant portion of players fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost isn&amp;rsquo;t money, it&amp;rsquo;s time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game also features an entertainment mode to cater to casual players&amp;rsquo; needs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, League of Legends is more about fulfilling a long-held wish and experiencing the joy of comebacks. There are also many &amp;ldquo;armchair gamers&amp;rdquo; who don&amp;rsquo;t play the game anymore but still watch the World Championship every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unavoidable to mention &lt;strong&gt;。指的不是单局游戏的时间，而是你上号的时间，周末的下午、每天工作日的晚上七点到晚上十点之间，你会发现和队友大部分情况都能正常沟通，你发出去的信号，队友能理解，能收到回应。换到其他时间，比如说通宵游戏，你碰到的更多就是&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;，顺风的情况，无事发生，逆风的情况下，他们能问候你的全家，隔着屏幕你都能感受到那股子&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in the IT industry, I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to and played a lot of games across various genres. When it comes to competitive gaming, I’ve always relied on strategy rather than raw reflexes; my natural aptitude is there. Compared to professionals or younger players, my reaction time is slower. My preference is to lead teams—taking control and directing the game. I started playing back in school, when we were guided by the older members of our guild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gaming environment now is quite restless, lacking the purity of before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After advancing to a higher grade, playing high-level matches is truly exhausting. It requires constant intense focus, analyzing your opponent&amp;rsquo;s strategies and figuring out how to counter their traps – it’s the kind of experience where you don’t want to play another game afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being truly good at gaming isn&amp;rsquo;t impactful for life’s trajectory unless you pursue it professionally. It can serve as a social tool, but won&amp;rsquo;t provide a livelihood or allow you to establish yourself in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-player games and online games are two distinct types of games with significant differences in gameplay, experience, and technology. Here are some key aspects to understand the distinctions between them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This game is played locally on your device and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require an internet connection. Players can enjoy the experience without a network connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These games typically require an internet connection as players interact with each other in real-time. Online games can be cooperative or competitive, involving online socializing and competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players primarily interact with in-game AI, preset missions, or adversarial elements. The gaming experience is typically more personalized and influenced by the game&amp;rsquo;s design and narrative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Players can interact with other real players from around the world. This may include cooperating on tasks, competing against or alongside each other, and social elements like chat and guild systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game design emphasizes providing a complete, self-contained narrative and game experience. Game content is typically pre-designed, with players exploring, solving puzzles, or engaging in combat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game design must consider real-time interaction and competition or collaboration among players. Game content may be more dynamic, including regular updates, online events, and social interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It typically runs offline and has relatively low requirements for device performance and internet connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires a strong internet connection and high demands on server and network performance to ensure smooth real-time interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typically employs a one-time purchase or download commercial model, allowing players to fully play the game on their local device after purchasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game may adopt various commercial models such as free play, advertising, in-app purchases, or subscriptions to maintain server operations and continuously update game content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these distinctions helps players clarify their preferences when choosing a game, and enables game designers to better meet player expectations&lt;/p&gt;</description>
