&lt;li&gt;Abolish mortgage rate caps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting tomorrow, the housing fund interest rate will be lowered by 0.25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Down payment ratio reduced to 15%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$30 billion affordable housing refinancing loans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abolish-interest-rate-caps-on-first-time-and-second-home-mortgages-for-commercial-banks-nationwide&#34;&gt;Abolish interest rate caps on first-time and second home mortgages for commercial banks nationwide
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China (Shanghai Headquarters), branches in each province, autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government, and separately planned cities; all state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and all joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, adapt to the new changes in housing supply and demand and people&amp;rsquo;s expectations for quality housing, and promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, we hereby notify you of the following regarding adjustments to commercial personal housing loan interest rate policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliminate interest rate caps on first-time and second-home mortgages for commercial banks nationwide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of Chinaâ€™s provincial branches, following a city-specific approach, are guiding local lending rate self-discipline mechanisms. They will independently determine whether to set lower limits on interest rates for commercial personal housing loans in each city within their jurisdictions, based on the real estate market conditions and local government regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking and financial institutions should determine the specific interest rate for each loan, considering factors such as their own operational status, customer risk profiles, and any applicable lower interest rate limits set by provincial market rate pricing self-discipline mechanisms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-housing-provident-fund-loan-interest-rates-have-been-reduced-by-025-percentage-points&#34;&gt;Personal housing provident fund loan interest rates have been reduced by 0.25 percentage points
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Shanghai Head Office, branches in each province, autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government, and separately planned cities; policy-oriented banks, state-owned commercial banks, Postal Savings Bank of China, and various joint-stock commercial banks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China has decided to lower the interest rates for individual housing provident fund loans starting May 18, 2024. Rates for first-time home buyers will be adjusted to 2.35% and 2.85% for loans with terms of 5 years or less (including 5 years) and over 5 years respectively. Second-time home buyer rates will be no lower than 2.775% and 3.325% for the same loan durations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;down-payment-ratio-adjusted-to-no-less-than-15&#34;&gt;Down payment ratio adjusted to no less than 15%
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China (Shanghai Headquarters), branches in each province, autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government, and separately planned cities; all regulatory bureaus of the National Financial Regulatory Administration; state-owned commercial banks; Postal Savings Bank of China; and joint-stock commercial banks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To implement the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, adapt to the new changes in housing supply and demand and people&amp;rsquo;s expectations for quality homes, and promote the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, please note the following regarding personal mortgage policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For residential families purchasing a first home through loans, the minimum down payment for commercial personal housing loans is adjusted to no less than 15%. For second homes, it&amp;rsquo;s adjusted to no less than 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this foundation, each provincial branch of the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China and each sub-branch of the National Financial Regulatory Administration will independently determine the minimum down payment ratio for first-time and second-home commercial personal housing loans in their respective jurisdictions, in accordance with local government regulatory requirements and the principle of city-specific policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-central-bank-will-establish-a-rmb-300-billion-affordable-housing-refinancing-program&#34;&gt;The central bank will establish a RMB 300 billion affordable housing refinancing program
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 4 p.m., representatives from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Ministry of Natural Resources, the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, and the National Financial Regulatory Administration convened at a regular policy briefing held by the State Council to introduce supporting policies related to ensuring housing delivery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, Vice Governor of the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China Yao Ling announced that the central bank will establish a RMB 300 billion affordable housing refinancing facility to support local state-owned enterprises in acquiring completed but unsold commercial properties at reasonable prices for use as rental or share ownership affordable housing, which is expected to stimulate RMB 500 billion in bank loans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the central bank, affordable housing lending has a one-year term with up to four extensions and an interest rate of 1.75%. It is directed towards 21 nationwide banks, encouraging them to provide loans to local state-owned enterprises selected by cities to acquire completed but unsold commercial properties for use as affordable housing. These acquisitions are strictly limited to existing, unsold commercial properties from real estate developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China will soon release a notice regarding establishing affordable housing refinancing loans&lt;/p&gt;</description>
