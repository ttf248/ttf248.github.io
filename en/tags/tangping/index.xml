        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently, the popular &amp;ldquo;Da Bing&amp;rdquo; (Big Ice) on Douyin (TikTok) has been frequently seen with short video accounts extracted from her live streams. A listener who joined a live call asked: “Da Bing, I want to sell my house in Xi&amp;rsquo;an and return home to settle down.” Da Bing responded: “At your age, you’re in your early thirties; you can’t settle down. Your parents are on the path of aging, your children haven’t started a family or established themselves, and if you return home, you’ll still need to deal with the ‘parameshik’ (婆罗门) in the small county.”
Let&amp;rsquo;s put aside whether the viewpoint is right or wrong, what does the term “parameshik” (婆罗门) mean?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;township-brahmins-the-big-shots-of-small-places&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Township Brahmins: The “Big Shots” of Small Places&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many small county towns, people often talk about so-called &amp;ldquo;township brahmins&amp;rdquo;—the existence of these individuals seems to be a symbol of local society. They are not necessarily genuine religious figures and do not possess “high-level” titles; rather, they are seemingly ordinary but nonetheless influential people. They represent “power, status, and influence” within that county town, symbolizing a particular class or stratum in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-xiancheng-babao&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an “Xiancheng Babao?”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand that “Babao” originally referred to the highest caste in Indian society, representing wisdom, authority, and spiritual supremacy. In China’s county towns, the term “Xiancheng Babao” doesn&amp;rsquo;t have such a complex religious background; it’s more of a metaphor for a social phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, an “Xiancheng Babao” can be understood as some “cultural authorities” within the county town – such as teachers, doctors, well-known merchants, and officials, etc. Although their positions may seem ordinary, in this relatively closed environment, they possessed a comparatively higher social status, or their opinions and actions had influence that could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-the-county-town-brahmin&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is the &amp;ldquo;County Town Brahmin&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a county town, there are almost always these “Brahmins” – individuals who hold influence in virtually every industry. They might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educators:&lt;/strong&gt; Particularly teachers with decades of experience locally, who may not have graduated from prestigious universities but understand how to establish credibility through knowledge and are widely respected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local Government Officials:&lt;/strong&gt; Deputy county magistrates, section chiefs, etc., who control certain resources and power, even if their positions aren&amp;rsquo;t high-ranking; their limited scope of authority can make them local “Brahmins.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local &amp;ldquo;Entrepreneurs&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/strong&gt; Some business owners in county towns, although not large in scale, hold a certain amount of wealth and have a voice in the region. They might operate one or two well-known local small businesses and wield considerable influence within the county town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-status-of-county-town-brahmins--how-does-it-impact-society&#34;&gt;The Status of “County Town Brahmins” – How Does it Impact Society?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly understand the significance of “county town brahmins,” we must consider the unique environment of the county town. Here, information flow is slower than in large cities, and social mobility is relatively fixed. These “brahmins” often accumulated prestige, knowledge, and connections through long-term dedication to the local area. They influence various aspects of local politics, economics, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; In small places, especially where education systems may not be as developed and people have limited choices, local &amp;ldquo;brahmins&amp;rdquo; subtly shape the cultural atmosphere through knowledge transmission in classrooms, explanations in media, and even moral guidance in social settings. &lt;strong&gt;Concentration of Social Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the limited population and resources in county-level cities, these “Brahman” figures were often one of the primary controllers of local resources. Whether it was social welfare, policy implementation, or the approval of certain projects, they invariably exerted influence. Their power of speech and decision-making allowed them to hold a significant position within the local society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Networked Structure of Interpersonal Relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; In a relatively closed small community, interpersonal relationships are often crucial. These “county Brahman” figures established powerful social networks to control information flow and resource allocation, thereby playing a decisive role at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-metaphor-of-the-county-sharma&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Metaphor of the “County Sharma”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the “county sharma” (often translated as &amp;ldquo;town Brahmin&amp;rdquo;) is frequently regarded with respect and admiration, this position of elevated status isn’t without its issues. In modern society, it&amp;rsquo;s not difficult to observe that many county-level “sharmas” lack genuine ability and innovative spirit; instead, they maintain their positions through hereditary relationships and resource monopolies. With the development of informatization, these “sharmas’” power is gradually being broken down, and new social mobility is beginning to influence the appearance of small counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the “county sharma” is a fascinating social phenomenon that reflects the power and cultural structures within local societies. Although their “power” may not directly threaten national governance, they are undoubtedly key figures within the locality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this would have happened if we hadn’t started with curiosity about what a ‘purohito’ was, then tossed it to ‘kimi’. The result was surprisingly funny – I could see the web interface already pulling up search results, but instantly they were blocked from displaying related content. Then I wondered, did this word hold some special significance? So I passed it on to ‘ChatGPT’, and that&amp;rsquo;s how this article came about.&lt;/p&gt;
