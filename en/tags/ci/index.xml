        <description>&lt;p&gt;Use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your Hugo blog to GitHub Pages and Gitee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;background-introduction&#34;&gt;Background Introduction
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday while updating the blog, I discovered that the travis service was unavailable. Upon checking the travis webpage, I noticed the progress was stuck during source code retrieval, and a flash of inspiration hit me – I thought about GitHub’s previously launched action service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was quite busy, and also needed to apply to use action. Now that it has officially gone live, I have some free time over the weekend and wanted to try out a new toy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official documentation can be found by entering the website yourself; this article will not do much more copying and pasting. If you’ve used Kubernetes before, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that the action YAML file configuration is very similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding introductory tutorials or Chinese introduction materials, I recommend searching for &lt;strong&gt;阮一峰’s blog&lt;/strong&gt;. There are two articles – the first introduces the basic syntax, and the second provides a practical case study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;#### Content

Knowledge Points Needed
- GitHub Secrets
- Action Syntax
The core job uses existing components to complete the task, and pushing to the domestic Gitee is implemented using commands. This command approach is quite brute force, as it performs forceful pushes, inheriting the logic used with Travis.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the actions provided by the official market, currently there are quite a few supported playstyles. After building a Docker image, it’s no longer dependent on services offered by Docker Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the Hugo issues, using GitHub Actions to automatically deploy Git Pages results in the final published website needing to be on the master branch. If deployed from another branch, the settings interface will prompt an error indicating that the deployed webpage has syntax problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is simply because Hugo’s source files are located on the master branch, and GitHub treats it as the Jelly blog&amp;rsquo;s source code for detection, unable to check and resolve any errors resulting in the error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is straightforward: move Hugo source files to another branch and publish static files to the master branch.&lt;/p&gt;
