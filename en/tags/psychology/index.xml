        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s digital age, games have evolved far beyond a simple form of entertainment and have become an indispensable part of people&amp;rsquo;s daily lives. From a psychological perspective, games play different roles in the mental development of individuals across various age groups, while also being closely intertwined with social and recreational activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-state&#34;&gt;Mental State
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people are in the stage of self-exploration and identity formation. &lt;strong&gt;Games provide them with a low-cost environment to try and explore.&lt;/strong&gt; Through games, they can experiment with different roles and lifestyles, satisfying their curiosity and desire for exploration. As they grow older, individuals’ interests and values gradually stabilize, and games may no longer align with their life goals and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes&#34;&gt;Social Attributes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the game has also become a part of social activities, particularly for young people. They make friends and build social networks through games, making games a bridge for socialization. However, as people age, their social circles gradually stabilize, and social needs may be met through more mature ways, leading to a relative reduction in the role of games in socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-attributes-bringing-a-sister-with-a-female-player&#34;&gt;Social Attributes: Bringing a Sister (with a female player)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within China, due to a lack of adequate dating education, parents often simply expect you to study well and then immediately want you to start a relationship after graduation. This phenomenon is very common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of busy studies, work, or a lack of social skills, individuals haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to establish stable emotional relationships in real life, leading to feelings of loneliness and a desire for attention. &lt;strong&gt;The “bringing a sister” behavior within games provides an outlet to release this craving.&lt;/strong&gt; By helping and protecting female players, they can experience being needed and valued, gaining emotional satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the interactive rules within games are clearly defined, and the environment is controllable, offering a sense of certainty and security compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real-life interactions, reducing fear of the uncertainties in real-world relationships. ## Social Attributes: Bringing a Sister (with a female player)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the interactive rules within games are clearly defined, and the environment is controllable, offering a sense of certainty and security compared to the complexity and uncertainty of real-life interactions, reducing fears associated with the unpredictability of real relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-world-pressure&#34;&gt;Real-World Pressure
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games provide a virtual world where players can temporarily escape the pressures, challenges, or unpleasant emotions of real life. Particularly for young people facing academic pressure, family issues, or interpersonal relationship challenges, games may become a way to seek comfort and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games are typically designed to give players a sense of accomplishment and recognition when completing tasks, leveling up, or defeating opponents. Young people may become addicted to games because they can experience a feeling of being appreciated and recognized within them – a feeling that may be lacking in their real lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dislike-playing-after-getting-older&#34;&gt;Dislike Playing After Getting Older
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young, individuals face relatively fewer social responsibilities and pressures, allowing them more time and energy to invest in gaming. As they enter the workforce, start families, and take on other societal responsibilities, time and energy become increasingly valuable, and games may be seen as a drain rather than a preferred leisure activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people age, their cognitive abilities and interests also change. They might have been interested in fast-paced, visually stunning games when younger, but with increased experience, they may prefer strategy games, those with strong storylines, or games with greater depth. If the market doesn’t meet these changing needs, interest naturally diminishes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game Psychology: Competitive Gaming</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/game-psychology-competitive-gaming/</link>

        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay-to-Win games, which we won’t discuss here; within the gaming community, this is commonly referred to as “Renminbi Warriors” – requiring a wealthy wallet rather than an understanding of game settings. Their enjoyment lies in the entourage of smaller players and the thrill of “raid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitive games with large audiences, such as League of Legends, DOTA, Honor of Kings, and PUBG, have complete worldviews and well-established, positive competitive cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychology is a key area in game design, particularly social psychology. Understanding people’s behavior, needs, and motivations can help create more engaging gaming experiences. Regarding the relationship between “showing off” (装逼) and social psychology, we can examine it from several angles:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Validation:&lt;/strong&gt; People often seek to establish a sense of belonging within social groups. In games, designing elements that allow players to feel accomplished and noticed by other players can increase their social validation. This may manifest as boasting skills or showcasing earned rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Competition:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games employ social competition elements, encouraging players to showcase their achievements within a social network. This can be achieved through leaderboards, achievement systems, or multiplayer battles. Such designs stimulate competitive psychology among players, potentially leading some players to perform more exceptionally in order to gain social recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Expression:&lt;/strong&gt; Some games allow players to express themselves through customization options like character avatars and virtual items. This self-expression isn’t just about showing off; it can also be a way to express personality and engage in social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teamwork:&lt;/strong&gt; Certain games emphasize teamwork, achieving game objectives through social interaction. In these scenarios, boasting behavior may not be encouraged but rather emphasizes collaboration and mutual support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological Reward Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design can utilize psychological reward systems to incentivize positive social behaviors. For example, rewarding players or granting them privileges to encourage active participation in social interactions.
Overall, the application of social psychology in game design can be used to shape player interaction and social experiences. Fluffing (or showing off) behavior can sometimes occur in certain contexts, but game designers typically strive to balance this behavior to ensure the gaming experience is positive and enjoyable for all players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to get sidetracked when thinking about things; without a complete outline, it does tend to become a little disorganized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author’s frequently played League of Legends is considered one of our generation&amp;rsquo;s cherished childhood memories. Most parents don’t like their children playing games, as they haven’t deeply understood or experienced this type of game, and naturally, it has to do with the game’s setting. Each match is a fresh start, and for many kids, when playing, they don’t bring much thought into it, opting for a self-exploration style of gameplay. Under this mode, the outcome of the game often depends more on the player&amp;rsquo;s inherent gaming talent. Based on my personal experience, a significant portion of players fall into this category; for them&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost isn’t money, but time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s also a casual mode within the game, designed to meet the needs of entertainment players.
League of Legends, this competitive game, for me, was more about realizing a “Three Kingdoms dream.” Starting with an empty purse, relying on my own understanding, I farmed, supplemented, spent money, controlled vision, set traps for the enemy team, and it was primarily a game played with my mind – without exceptional gaming talent, I could still have a lot of fun. The feeling of controlling the overall situation and the joy of turning a disadvantage into a victory. And there are also many viewers who often mention “cloud players” – they no longer play the game but still watch the matches during major world championship events.
Here, we must also talk about “game time.” “I’m not talking about the time of a single game, but rather the time you log in. This includes weekend afternoons and evenings between 7 PM and 10 PM during weekdays – at this time, you&amp;rsquo;ll generally find that you can communicate normally with your teammates, receiving their signals and getting responses in return. However, if you switch to times like late-night gaming sessions, you’re more likely to encounter ‘gaming addicts,’ favorable wind conditions (where nothing happens), and opponents who will greet your entire family through the screen, accompanied by a palpable sense of ‘hostility’ even across the distance.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As someone working in the IT industry and having played many different types of games, I&amp;rsquo;ve always preferred to play competitive games using my brain rather than relying on reaction speed or innate talent. Compared to younger players or professionals, my response time is slower; I’m accustomed to grouping up with teammates and taking command as a team leader.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, how would you describe the current game environment? It’s quite frantic and lacks the pure essence of what it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduating, playing high-level ranked games was really exhausting – it required complete focus throughout the entire match, thinking about the opponent’s plans and how to counter their setups. It&amp;rsquo;s that state where you don&amp;rsquo;t want to continue playing after finishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you say you play very well, without professional competition, it wouldn’t have much impact on one’s life trajectory. While it can be a social tool, it cannot provide a livelihood or establish oneself in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-player and online games are two different types of games with significant differences in gameplay, experience, and technology. Here are some key aspects to understand the distinction between single-player and online games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connection Method:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-player Games (Offline/Single-player):&lt;/strong&gt; These games are played on a local device independently, without requiring an internet connection. Players can enjoy the game experience even without network connectivity. - &lt;strong&gt;Online/Multiplayer Games:&lt;/strong&gt; These games typically require an internet connection because players need to interact in real-time with other players. Online games can be cooperative or competitive, involving online social interaction and esports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player Interaction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players primarily interact with in-game artificial intelligence, pre-set tasks, or hostile elements. The gaming experience is typically more personalized and influenced by the game’s design and storyline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiplayer Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Players can interact with other real players from around the world. This may include collaborating on missions, competing against each other, participating in esports, and social elements such as chat, guild systems, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Design and Content:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design focuses more on providing a complete and independent storyline and gaming experience. Game content is typically pre-designed, and players explore, solve puzzles, or engage in combat within the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiplayer Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Game design needs to consider real-time interaction and player competition or collaboration. Game content may be more dynamic, including regular updates, online events, and social interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Typically can run offline with relatively low requirements for device performance and internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Require a strong internet connection and have high demands on server and network performance to ensure smooth real-time interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Model:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Player Games:&lt;/strong&gt; Typically employ a one-time purchase or download model, where players buy the game to play it fully on their local devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Games:&lt;/strong&gt; May utilize various business models such as free-to-play, advertising, item purchases, or subscriptions to maintain server operations and continuously update game content.
Understanding these distinctions helps players clarify their preferences when choosing games and enables game designers to better meet player expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
