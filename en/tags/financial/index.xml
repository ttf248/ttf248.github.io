        <title>Zhejiang Jin Securities Financial Crisis – A Poor Scam and Out-of-Control Zhejiang Jin</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Personal Note: Layered investment products, underlying assets that ordinary investors can’t understand; those behind it know they won&amp;rsquo;t cheat the poor, but will relentlessly exploit the poor, and are likely to accept cheating the middle class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s December 2025, and a large number of investors in Zhejiang Province are still blocking doors to seek redress due to investment losses – this event has been particularly hot in the financial investment field, and we can find several keywords: state-owned background, low yields, civil servant/teacher as investment subjects (minimum purchase of 200,000 RMB, KYC of 400,000 RMB), etc. This proves that no matter how sophisticated a financial tool is or how strong its backing, which groups are buying it has evolved into an “othering” risk. If you only see these keywords, it means your understanding of the full picture is still too shallow. There’s a lot to dig into regarding this actual loss – it&amp;rsquo;s worth investigating deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;borrowing-from-yourself-and-securing-financing-with-receivables&#34;&gt;Borrowing from Yourself and Securing Financing with Receivables
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financing, collateralized, and issuing platforms are interconnected entities within the “Xiangyuan” system – a group of companies that can be understood as essentially borrowing money from oneself. Subsequently, through controlled state-owned financial platforms, receivables are used as collateral to access market financing, further increasing leverage—and it’s all self-dealing. The sole objective is to inject fresh blood from the outside. As the saying goes, “If all witnesses, circumstantial evidence, and sponsoring/cooperating entities are my people, how can I argue with them?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the AA+ credit rating presented to investors, it appears more impressive than some sovereign debt ratings of entire economies, a solid investment-grade financial rating. However, when compared closely, it’s no match for the credibility of Evergrande and Greentown Property before their defaults; even AAA ratings carry significant weight. Furthermore, like Wanke, which survived after the cessation of support from Sino-Iron Group, continues to maintain an AAA credit rating despite ongoing assessments by domestic rating agencies in China, demonstrates a blatant disregard for personal credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a shockingly flawed product was able to successfully issue to investors, with seamless access at every stage and a high credit rating. Are the issuing institutions fools? Not really; this involves the second distribution of profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;extremely-high-intermediation-costs&#34;&gt;Extremely High Intermediation Costs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any bizarre operations occur in the financial sector, the true interest allocation relationships are often hidden behind empty rhetoric. Investors only receive 4% returns, while the issuer’s overall financing costs reach 8-9%, and the 4-5% commission in between is a share of profits across various stages of issuance – extremely exaggerated. This is a fundamental characteristic of instability within the financial system: interests take precedence over business capabilities, and everyone shares in investor money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why investors see low interest rates as a source and, considering risk-free returns of around 2.5% in 2023 and 2024, the risk premium is only 1.5%, compounded by state-owned enterprise (SOE) backing – it’s not really considered a high-risk asset unless you study the underlying assets and equity structures. Instead, this low return has become the primary reason for being exploited, as 6%, 8%, or 10% returns are difficult to achieve given the risks seen in concentrated defaults in previous years, which has led investors to be wary of high-yield investments. Now, low returns aren’t low risk; it&amp;rsquo;s simply due to excessively high intermediary commissions. For the actual enterprise end, willing to offer 8-9% as financing costs isn’t a generous act – it’s purely for investor principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This risk is incomprehensible to outsiders, but does SOE shareholders not understand it? Don’t underestimate the ability of these people to seek profit and avoid loss. What happens if there&amp;rsquo;s a default? Of course, they quietly exit before the default occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;state-owned-enterprise-shell-game&#34;&gt;State-Owned Enterprise Shell Game
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the third magical aspect. Equity changes were quietly executed, and there was no sufficient risk disclosure or notification provided to investors. When buying, it was backed by state ownership; when maturity arrived, it turned out to be a private enterprise. The result was that everyone saw clarifying statements, vehement denials of any connection, and investors were left bewildered. Aside from the nearly empty shell, there was hardly anyone in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously known as the Zhejiang Financial Asset Trading Center, a place with clear gold exchange characteristics, after the one-page document canceled the Zhejiang Jin center’s financial license last November, it was renamed Zhejiang Zhijin Asset Operation Co., Ltd. this year and truly implemented a normal investment institution without official backing. Although it cannot issue new wealth management products, it must bear absolute redemption obligations for the preceding products, and it has early-planned exits – essentially playing a clever “golden cicada shedding its skin.” Only investors were caught in the trap of state ownership backing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-estate-downturn-cycle-and-risk-spillover&#34;&gt;Real Estate Downturn Cycle and Risk Spillover
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding whether it’s finance or the risk spillover from real estate, China&amp;rsquo;s financial system, including banks, has benefited too much from profits in real estate over the past decade. It was easy to make money with a 10% funding cost – as long as you could secure projects and quickly turn over sales, property developers didn’t care about costs. However, during a real estate downturn cycle, property developers go bankrupt one after another, and the true risk spillover is that you simply don&amp;rsquo;t know how much of the underlying assets in the financial products you hold are related to real estate investments. It’s like patching up one wall with another, ultimately leading to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, direct defaults by homebuyers, defaults by high-net-worth group trusts, and even financial products issued directly by these property developers – whenever the underlying assets are related to real estate investment, they either default outright or evolve into a “parasite” situation, relying on debt to sustain themselves until their liquidity runs out, at which point they inevitably collapse. It’s simply a matter of who is the last link in the chain of drumming – for example, ZJCC Securities&amp;rsquo; main products are almost entirely based on Shaanxi Xiangyuan Group’s real estate projects, with this proportion reaching over 90% after 2023. Or, it involves debt transactions between related companies. The core issue is that houses aren’t selling, and there isn’t new blood coming in. These assets weren&amp;rsquo;t the first to collapse, and they certainly won’t be the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-state-owned-assets-fall-into-the-trap&#34;&gt;Why Did State-Owned Assets Fall into the Trap?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dig deeper – why did the wealth management products behind Zhejiang Jinrong Center still meticulously select specific wealth size groups, namely only open to members, and idle funds were also above 200k-400k? This demographic perfectly overlaps with local civil servants and teachers – a truly ridiculous spectacle backed by state-owned assets, deceiving both locals and Chinese people. What allowed a regional gold exchange center to become a financing tool for Xiangyuan Group, akin to the absurdity of Evergrande and Shengjing Bank, requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us back to the 2018 breach by Huaxin Group, which itself is a much larger financial story involving defaulted products exceeding one trillion yuan. While our financial system lags behind, we certainly aren&amp;rsquo;t lacking in this ability to innovate financially and make money. Of course, we’re focusing solely on the 3.7 billion defaulted products related to Zhejiang Jinrong Center – a pot that can’t be easily discarded; it was almost entirely state-owned. And precisely because of this risk loss, Zhejiang Jinrong Center urgently sought high-yield assets and capital supplementation, leading to important connections with Xiangyuan Group, after all, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t rely on the current real estate market fervor to disprove the fact that Zhejiang Jinrong Center’s decision-makers, at the time, were eager to invest in highly sought-after property giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Shunfu Steel Group’s 6 billion investment in Vanke – others could only get on this line by investing money; in 2018, real estate was still at its peak. Zhejiang Jinrong Center didn&amp;rsquo;t spend any money and, instead, injected 120 million yuan into the stockholding enterprise in 2019, engaging in transactions with demons, laying the groundwork for future loss of control. When you encounter a small problem and want to put a larger lid on it, that’s often the first step towards losing control – because of the 3.7 billion default, introducing property giants and pursuing seemingly high-yield projects, Zhejiang Jinrong Center was gradually led into the abyss. It&amp;rsquo;s also worth admiring the level of the referee; they already successfully shed their skin. Regarding the banner of Zhejiang Jinrong Center being canceled in November last year – it has no bearing now, forming a perfect closed loop with the opening of the article. As for pursuing legal recourse, wait and see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concluding Remarks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market returns themselves are not constant. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use past average returns as a reference for current risk; for example, the risk-free yield suggestions for the previous few years’ columns were around 3% for large savings bonds, while now it can only provide 1.5%. And future judgments will be more complex – low yields don’t necessarily mean low risk, just like the packaging of these defaulted products. The combination of “ordinary people + investment” in this cyclical environment is better to focus on risk and principal rather than returns; absolutely do not blindly gamble. Pay attention to underlying assets, genuine credit backing, diversify investments, even if you think you have earlier information and stable redemption guarantees within the system – don’t forget to prioritize basic living expenses and future fixed-cost savings in low-yield, low-risk or almost risk-free places; losing is better than winning. Tiered allocation and diversified allocation are the only choices for ordinary people in this environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;risk-disclaimer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The offering may not be completed, and requires fulfillment of multiple prerequisites (such as market stability, regulatory approval, and the absence of significant adverse events)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is not completed within 14 days, the subscription matter will automatically become invalid.&lt;/li&gt;

Jiu Fang Investment plans to use HK$746 million to invest in digital assets and on-chain finance, potentially transitioning towards Web3 and AI robo-advisor directions in the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-old-then-new-distribution-method-explained&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;First Old, Then New&amp;rdquo; Distribution Method Explained
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimi: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Existing shareholders first old shares then new&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; is a &lt;strong&gt;common Hong Kong distribution method&lt;/strong&gt;, known in English as &lt;strong&gt;Top-up Placement&lt;/strong&gt;, which you can understand as a two-step operation of “&lt;strong&gt;major shareholders sell old shares first and then subscribe to new shares&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-lets-take-an-example-to-understand-it&#34;&gt;✅ Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example to understand it
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking the case of &lt;strong&gt;Jiutian Intelligence Investment&lt;/strong&gt; as an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Major shareholders sell old shares (First Old)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing shareholders (such as Coreworth Investments) sell their existing holdings of &lt;strong&gt;20,000,000 old shares&lt;/strong&gt; to market investors (the underwriter) at a price of HKD 39.25 per share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This results in the &lt;strong&gt;major shareholder reducing their holding&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;total issued capital remains unchanged&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Company issues new shares to major shareholders (Later New)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company then issues an equal number (&lt;strong&gt;20,000,000 shares&lt;/strong&gt;) of new shares to these major shareholders at a price of HKD 39.25.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The major shareholder uses the proceeds from selling old shares to buy back new shares, &lt;strong&gt;restoring their holding quantity to its original state&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the total issued capital increases (from 448 million shares to 468 million shares), &lt;strong&gt;effectively meaning the company has successfully raised capital&lt;/strong&gt;, while the &lt;strong&gt;major shareholder&amp;rsquo;s shareholding ratio is slightly diluted&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Fundraising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Avoid the lengthy process of issuing new shares, instead selling old shares first and then supplementing with new shares to quickly raise capital.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The majority shareholders will maintain their voting power, and control won&amp;rsquo;t be significantly diluted.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attract New Investors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;❌ Not newly issued&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅ Can be immediately traded&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;These are existing shares on the market, which can be directly circulated after being sold to new investors.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimi: Your question is very central: &lt;strong&gt;Why do Hong Kong-listed companies seem to be able to “freely” issue shares? Is the Hong Kong market rulebook particularly relaxed?&lt;/strong&gt;
The answer is: &lt;strong&gt;Yes, HKEX offers significantly more flexibility than the Shanghai A-share market&lt;/strong&gt;, but it’s &lt;strong&gt;not “unlimited,”&lt;/strong&gt; rather there&amp;rsquo;s a system of &lt;strong&gt;“relaxed but limited” rules.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it require shareholder meeting approval?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;❌ Each issuance must be held with a &lt;strong&gt;separate shareholder meeting&lt;/strong&gt; and pass by a 2/3 majority vote.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it require SEC approval?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;❌ As long as it’s no more than 20% of share capital + offering price is no more than 20%, it can “flash allocation”&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;✅ Must undergo SEC &lt;strong&gt;case-by-case review&lt;/strong&gt;, which takes longer&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;-why-does-the-hong-kong-stock-exchange-look-casual&#34;&gt;✅ Why Does the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Look “Casual”?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“General Mandate” Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt;
Once a year, shareholders authorize the board to issue up to 20% new shares at their annual general meeting. Afterwards, &lt;strong&gt;no further shareholder meetings are required&lt;/strong&gt;, and the board can selectively issue shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Flash Placement” Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt;
If the issuance does not exceed 20% of the share capital and the discount is no more than 20%, &lt;strong&gt;the issuance can be completed within 24 hours without approval&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No SEC Case-by-Case Approval:
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange only conducts &lt;strong&gt;formative review&lt;/strong&gt;, without substantive intervention in the use of funds or company quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-lets-take-an-example-why-was-jiufang-zhitou-able-to-do-old-and-new-this-time&#34;&gt;✅ Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example: Why was JiuFang ZhiTou able to &amp;ldquo;do old and new&amp;rdquo; this time?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JiuFang ZhiTou obtained a &lt;strong&gt;general authorization&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;strong&gt;2025 June 20th shareholder meeting&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing for up to a 20% increase in new shares (i.e., up to 89,671,400 shares).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This issuance of 20,000,000 shares represents only &lt;strong&gt;4.46% of the capital&lt;/strong&gt;, far below the 20% limit, and &lt;strong&gt;fully complies with the authorization conditions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;no further shareholder meeting is needed&lt;/strong&gt; nor &lt;strong&gt;is approval from the Securities Regulatory Commission required&lt;/strong&gt;; the board of directors can make the decision to implement it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-summary-in-one-sentence-1&#34;&gt;✅ Summary in one sentence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong stocks allow “board of directors + annual authorization” rapid issuance under a streamlined process, provided it doesn’t exceed 20% of the share capital and the price cap, enabling “flash placement,” while A-shares require shareholder approval plus SEC review, resulting in a longer, more restrictive procedure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-summary-in-one-sentence-2&#34;&gt;✅ Summary in one sentence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Jiu Fang Zhi Tu (Nine Fang Intelligent Investment) is not “arbitrary issuance,” but rather &lt;strong&gt;legally and compliantly utilized the relaxed mechanisms of the Hong Kong stock market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/the-zhejiang-financial-circle-collapsed-and-the-anti-corruption-efforts-over-the-past-two-years-have-not-been-limited-to-government-departments/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw a report on Douyin about an anti-corruption investigation in the Zhejiang financial sector. I had written about the prelude to financial corruption once before, but didn&amp;rsquo;t follow up on related reports afterward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still check financial news every day, and previously I rarely saw any reports about financial corruption. However, there have been increasing reports of financial corruption over the past two years, with more and more senior executives from banks, securities firms, and other financial institutions being investigated.
&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;p/financial-anti-corruption-curtain-rise/&#34; &gt;Financial Anti-Corruption Curtain Rise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent systemic anti-corruption storm in the Zhejiang financial sector is one of the most iconic events in China’s financial field in recent years. This anti-corruption campaign, which began in 2023, centered around the collective downfall of the former presidents of Zhejiang branches of four major state-owned banks, exposing long-standing issues of power abuse and collusion between government and businesses within local financial systems. The following outlines the event timeline, core problems, underlying causes, and subsequent impacts from four dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-event-timeline-from-the-zhu-xiaoyu-case-to-the-collapse-of-the-gang-leaders-of-the-four-major-banks&#34;&gt;I. Event Timeline: From the Zhu Xiaoyu Case to the Collapse of the “Gang Leaders” of the Four Major Banks
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Spark: The Zhu Xiaoyu Case Unearths a Rotten Financial System Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In May 2023, Zhejiang Provincial Vice Governor Zhu Xiaoyu was investigated, and his corrupt pattern of &amp;ldquo;eating off finance&amp;rdquo; became a breakthrough point. During his tenure, he obtained massive profits through interfering in corporate IPOs and loans, and formed an alliance of interests with financial institution executives. In November 2023, Zhu Xiaoyu was expelled from the Communist Party and public office, and the numerous clues provided during the investigation directly triggered subsequent seismic events within the financial system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Corruption Storm Intensifies: Original Heads of Zhejiang Branches of the Four Major Banks Fall&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; Guo XinGang, the former Chairman of the China Bank’s Zhejiang Branch, was investigated. After retiring, he made money through low-priced property purchases and equity premiums, abusing his authority in mineral loan approvals, resulting in significant losses of state assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; Gao Qiang, the former Chairman of the Construction Bank’s Zhejiang Branch, was investigated. During his tenure, he illegally approved loans leading to multiple projects going bankrupt and receiving “consulting fees” exceeding tens of millions of yuan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; Feng Jianlong, the former Chairman of the Agricultural Bank’s Zhejiang Branch, voluntarily confessed, and during his tenure, he transformed the Zhejiang branch of the Agricultural Bank into a &amp;ldquo;family industrial business,&amp;rdquo; with relatives holding illegal positions and serious misconduct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 30, 2025:&lt;/strong&gt; Shen Rongqin, the former Chairman of ICBC’s Zhejiang Branch, was investigated. After retiring, he controlled institutions such as Changtang River Jinran Academy through “political rotation,” forming a network of interests with eight private enterprises.  Within 15 months, all the original heads of the four major banks&amp;rsquo; Zhejiang branches fell, creating a closed-loop anti-corruption effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory System Also Shakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In January 2025, Pan Guang’en, former Deputy Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee’s Financial Bureau, voluntarily confessed, using his privileged position to facilitate corporate equity reforms and investments, illegally receiving massive amounts of money. This marked a shift in the anti-corruption campaign from financial institutions to regulatory departments, revealing the deep entanglement of the “regulatory-financial institution-private enterprise” three-party interest chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-core-issues-credit-corruption-and-rotating-door-interest-chains&#34;&gt;II. Core Issues: Credit Corruption and Rotating Door Interest Chains
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misappropriation of Lending Power: The Core Tool of Corruption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All four former heads of the major banks utilized their lending power to transfer interests: Guo XinGang violated regulations by issuing mineral loans, Gao Qiang manipulated credit through “consulting fees,” Feng Jianlong’s family-style lending led to bad debts, and Shen Rongqin used the Golden Research Institute platform to channel funds to related enterprises. Data shows that 68% of individuals investigated within the banking system in 2024 were involved in illegal lending or loan approvals, highlighting a deeply concerning loss of control over lending power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotational Corruption: Retirement is Not a Safe Deposit Box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All four individuals continued to wield power through “identity transformation” after retirement: Guo XinGang served as the president of an industry association to intervene in credit lending, Gao Qiang transitioned to a securities dealer director to manipulate capital, and Shen Rongqin established a “financial-academic-research” platform to connect with private enterprises. This “retire and continue” model allowed retired executives to evade regulation and form hidden interest chains. The 2024 Financial Anti-Corruption White Paper revealed that 68% of cases involved retired executives, with the Zhejiang case serving as a typical example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurred Boundaries Between Government and Business: Interest Transfer from Banks to Private Enterprises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Changtang River Golden Research Institute, led by Shen Rongqin, was established with investments from eight private enterprises including Zhentai and Chuanhua, ostensibly an academic institution but in reality a political-economic nexus. Through this platform, Shen Rongqin directed banking resources towards related enterprises, forming a “banking institution – private enterprise think tank” binding model. Similar models were also evident in the cases of Guo XinGang and Gao Qiang, exposing the deep distortion of political-economic relations within local financial ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;three-root-causes-institutional-loopholes-and-regulatory-failures&#34;&gt;Three. Root Causes: Institutional Loopholes and Regulatory Failures
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Absence of Local Financial Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a major province for private economy, Zhejiang has been active in financial innovation, but the regulatory system hasn’t kept pace. Officials such as Zhu from Ju and Pan Guang&amp;rsquo;en have long dominated local financial policies, acting as both “athletes” and “referees,” leading to ineffective regulation. For example, during his tenure at the Financial Bureau, Pan Guang&amp;rsquo;en illegally interfered in corporate financing and share reform, but was not effectively restrained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure of Internal Controls within Financial Institutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internal supervision mechanisms of the four major banks’ Zhejiang branches were essentially empty. When Feng Jianlong served as the chairman of Zhejiang Branch of Agricultural Bank, his relatives quickly rose through the system, and the “one-voice” credit approval phenomenon was prominent. Shen Rongqin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Employee Care Plan&amp;rdquo; ostensibly provided welfare, but actually consolidated power by controlling frontline employees to cover up corrupt behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak External Supervision Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The enabling of cross-provincial investigations (such as the Shen Rongqin case being handled by the Liaoning Provincial Supervisory Commission) demonstrated that local protectionism had severely hindered anti-corruption progress. Furthermore, the complex equity relationships between financial institutions and private enterprises (such as half of the top ten loan customers of Zhejiang Merchants Bank were real estate companies) made risk transmission hidden, making traditional regulatory measures difficult to penetrate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;four-subsequent-impacts-regulatory-upgrading-and-industry-restructuring&#34;&gt;Four. Subsequent Impacts: Regulatory Upgrading and Industry Restructuring
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normalization of Anti-Corruption and Systemic Plugging of Leaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Provincial Supervision and Penetrating Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;: The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection adopted remote case handling to cut through local protection networks, and extended the scope of scrutiny from on-duty behavior to interest chains after retirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological Anti-Corruption Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;: Zhejiang piloted AI risk control models for credit approval, automatically identifying “people-based loans” and “political-business loans,” effectively curbing corruption at its source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restrictions on Departing Executives&lt;/strong&gt;: Zhejiang Province is drafting the &amp;ldquo;List of Financial Executive Post-Employment Restrictions,&amp;rdquo; stipulating that bank chairpersons are prohibited from serving affiliated companies within three years after retirement, cutting off chains of power options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restructuring of the Financial Ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systemic Risk Clearance in Banks&lt;/strong&gt;: Institutions such as Zhejiang Business Bank and Hangzhou Bank were initiated internal restructuring due to the downfall of senior executives, and high real estate loan ratios (such as Zhejiang Business Bank’s real estate non-performing asset rate reaching 2.48%) forced business transformation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimization of Financing Environment for Private Enterprises&lt;/strong&gt;: Following anti-corruption actions, Zhejiang Province launched policies such as “Zheke Loan,” providing 450 billion yuan in loans to 32,000 technology SMEs in 2024, driving finance back to its original purpose of serving the real economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Warning Effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The collective downfall of former branch managers of the four major banks in Zhejiang shattered the illusion of “safety after retirement,” conveying a signal of “zero tolerance and no blind spots” in financial anti-corruption. This event also provides a mirror for the entire Chinese financial system: only by strengthening power constraints and improving regulatory systems can we safeguard financial security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the Zhejiang financial circle was fundamentally a concentrated outburst of long-term loss of control over local financial power. This storm not only cleared out a number of “financial pests,” but also drove profound changes in regulatory models, institutional design, and industry ecosystems. In the future, how to balance financial innovation with risk management, and how to build “clean” government-business relationships will continue to be subjects of ongoing exploration for Zhejiang and even the entire Chinese financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Opening of Financial Anti-Corruption</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: will intensify anti-corruption efforts in state-owned enterprises and the financial sector, and thoroughly rectify “the four prevailing tendencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;communist-party-of-china-central-politburo&#34;&gt;Communist Party of China Central Politburo
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on September 27, reviewing the Comprehensive Report on the First Round Supervision of the First Session of the Twentieth Party Congress. Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, chaired the meeting. The meeting emphasized that the supervision and oversight work should be used as an opportunity to further strengthen the leadership of the Communist Party in all aspects, urging supervised party organizations to raise their political stance, conscientiously fulfill the responsibilities and missions assigned by the Central Committee, continuously enhance the core functions and competitiveness of state-owned enterprises, consolidate the important material and political foundations of socialism with Chinese characteristics, intensify financial institutions&amp;rsquo; service to the real economy and national strategies, and promote high-quality development. It was stressed to coordinate development and security, firmly establish bottom-line and limit thinking, adopt effective measures to prevent and mitigate major risks, and safeguard the safety line.  It was also necessary to advance comprehensive Party self-discipline to greater depths, consolidate the responsibility of the secretary of the党委 (party committee) as the first person, strengthen the responsibilities of leadership committees members “dual duties in one position,” and enhance the supervision responsibilities of disciplinary and supervisory organizations, highlight strengthening supervision of all levels’ “one leader”, intensify anti-corruption efforts in state-owned enterprises and financial sectors, deeply rectify “four prevailing styles,” deepen reform, improve systems, promote source governance, and facilitate treatment of problems comprehensively. (Xinhua)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating Major Financial Risks! Liu Liange, former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Merchants Bank, has been expelled from the Communist Party.
