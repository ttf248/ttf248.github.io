        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rare, but eventually you&amp;rsquo;ll encounter it given enough time. Associated stock code: Berkshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-body&#34;&gt;Main body
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When submitting stock codes with names containing certain formatting, adjustments to the code name are required for Interactive Brokers (IB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRK/B -&amp;gt; BRK B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Interactive Brokers, it can be analyzed to determine that the conversion rules are fixed and can be implemented through coding. When the rules are not fixed, the system generally needs to store corresponding mappings, which business operation personnel update periodically.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A trade disruption refers to when a trade has been executed and IB has received execution information from the exchange. Then, the exchange realizes that an error has occurred (such as pricing, electronic processing issues, obvious errors, etc.) and decides to disrupt (cancel) the trade. This process is entirely determined and controlled by the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A busted traderefers to a situation where an execution occurs and IB receives the execution messagefrom the exchange. The exchange then realizes some type of error (Pricing,electronic, obvious error, etc) and rules to bust (cancel) the trade. Theexchange makes these rulings entirely on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a trading perspective, it is equivalent to trade cancellation and trade correction on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange&lt;/p&gt;</description>
