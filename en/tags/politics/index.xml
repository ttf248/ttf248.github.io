        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I went to enjoy the atmosphere during the Spring Festival season, and this time I watched two movies, feeling it was somewhat different&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explores the new developments in the 2025 Spring Festival movie season, focusing on &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Guardian of the Galaxy: The Magic Child.&amp;rdquo; The former uses the backdrop of San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown in 1900 to depict the discrimination and oppression faced by Chinese people, reflecting the social and political environment. The latter, as an animated film, employs rich metaphorical elements to satirize the current international political landscape, such as the Yuxu Palace resembling the Pentagon, alluding to the American political system; dollar signs on the Tianyuan Ding symbolizing US dollar hegemony; the Immortal Jade Tablet akin to a green card suggesting hierarchical status; and the Soul-Destroying Pill similar to biological weapons hinting at malicious actions. Both films bring a new viewing experience and prompt reflection on the relationship between film art and political expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;innovation-in-the-style-of-spring-festival-season-films&#34;&gt;Innovation in the style of Spring Festival season films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, films released during the Spring Festival season have been lighthearted and family-friendly, aiming to help audiences relax and unwind during the holiday. However, the 2025 Spring Festival season broke with convention as &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha: Ayakoya&amp;rdquo; incorporated rich political elements, sparking widespread discussion among viewers and ushering in a new era for Spring Festival films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-vivid-reflection-of-the-eras-politics&#34;&gt;A Vivid Reflection of the Era&amp;rsquo;s Politics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;《Mystery of Tangram》is set in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Chinatown in 1900, a time when Chinese people overseas faced severe racial discrimination and oppression. As the protagonists investigate the case, they must not only solve the mystery but also confront discrimination and unfair treatment from all sides of society. The film’s portrayal of racial discrimination and power struggles realistically reflects the social and political environment of the time, allowing us to see the arduous struggle that Chinese immigrants made for survival and dignity during that turbulent era. The underlying political issues are worthy of in-depth reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such historical background inevitably brings to mind the current difficulties faced by overseas Chinese in the business sector, such as the TikTok and Zhou Shuzhong incident&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 6, 2024, local time, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected TikTok’s request and upheld the constitutionality of a law mandating its sale on national security grounds. In a memo to employees, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew wrote that the next step will be “to seek an injunction and await review by the U.S. Supreme Court.” The event originated from the passage of the &amp;ldquo;Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act&amp;rdquo; in the United States, which stipulates that ByteDance must divest its U.S. TikTok business within 270 days of the bill&amp;rsquo;s passage, with a final deadline for the forced sale of January 19, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Shou Zi Chew also faced numerous challenges at various hearings. On January 31, 2024, local time, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on &amp;ldquo;Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis.&amp;rdquo; Prominent anti-China lawmaker Tom Cotton questioned Shou Zi Chew with a series of 8 questions about nationality, including asking his country of origin, whether he had applied for Chinese or American citizenship, and even questioning the nationalities of his wife and children. Although the hearing&amp;rsquo;s theme was &amp;ldquo;online child sexual exploitation,&amp;rdquo; the senator shifted the topic to TikTok being owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, forcing Shou Zi Chew to answer questions unrelated to the subject matter. Just like the discrimination faced by Chinese people overseas in &amp;ldquo;Detective Chinatown 1900,&amp;rdquo; Shou Zi Chew is experiencing unfair treatment and questioning due to TikTok&amp;rsquo;s background in the business realm. This series of events reflects that overseas Chinese have always faced numerous obstacles from external forces when pursuing their own development and protecting their rights, whether it was racial discrimination a century ago or today’s political manipulation in commerce—all of which deserve our deep reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-analysis-of-the-political-metaphor-behind-ne-zha-the-demon-child&#34;&gt;An Analysis of the Political Metaphor Behind &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha: The Demon Child&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ne Zha&amp;rsquo;s Revenge, while appearing to be an ordinary animated film, is filled with political metaphors in its various settings and plot points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping of the Power System&lt;/strong&gt;: The Biying Palace is portrayed as the supreme power center of the realm of immortals, with an architectural style similar to the Pentagon in the United States. Its interior is predominantly white, symbolizing Western hegemonic powers pushing their agenda under the guise of &amp;ldquo;universal values.&amp;rdquo; The “Demon Extermination Squad” led by Wuliang Immortal, and its subordinates, Lunu and He Nü, are believed to correspond to the US alliance system, specifically Japan and South Korea. The “online meeting” scene in Biying Palace, where the Twelve Golden Immortals sit and discuss the &amp;ldquo;War of the Conferred Gods,&amp;rdquo; is likened to NATO meetings led by the United States, which suppress other countries under the banner of &amp;ldquo;maintaining order.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The suggestion of economic hegemony: The Tianyuan Cauldron, used for alchemy in Yuxu Palace, has a dollar sign at the entrance, metaphorically representing how the United States &amp;ldquo;alchemizes&amp;rdquo; resources from other countries through economic hegemony. In the film, Wuliang Xianweng throws the dragon clan into the cauldron to be refined under the guise of “acting on behalf of heaven,” similar to how certain countries seek benefits by exploiting &amp;ldquo;international rules.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The metaphor of identity and hierarchy: The jade pendant representing the divine status that Nezha receives is highly similar to a US green card in color and design, symbolizing the exclusion and hierarchical division of immortals towards &amp;ldquo;outsiders,&amp;rdquo; hinting at the differences in identity and unequal treatment between different countries and groups in reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The allusion to malicious acts: The Oblivion Pill forced on Nezha by the Immortal Wonderman, resembling a bioweapon, subtly mocks certain countries that, under the guise of &amp;ldquo;saving the world,&amp;rdquo; engage in destruction and ruin of other nations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbol of Resources and Development&lt;/strong&gt;: As a key element in reshaping the bodies of Nezha and Ao Bing, Qise Baolian (Seven-Colored Lotus) symbolizes the energy and technological lifelines monopolized by powerful nations. The acquisition of its “essence and elixir” requires passing the “immortality examination” of Yuxu Palace, reflecting the dependence of developing countries on core resources and the &amp;ldquo;rule-based predation&amp;rdquo; they face under a hegemonic system. The lotus’s temporary failure and recovery conditions allude to the survival challenges faced by small nations amidst energy crises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-deep-reflection-on-film-art-and-political-expression&#34;&gt;A deep reflection on film art and political expression
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two films incorporated political elements into the nationwide movie-going frenzy during the Spring Festival season, bringing audiences a new viewing experience. They are no longer just purely entertaining works but more like mirrors reflecting political issues in history and reality. This has sparked deep reflection on the relationship between cinematic art and political expression. Will directors increasingly convey their views on society and politics through film in future creations? Can cinema, as a powerful cultural medium, take on greater attention to and contemplation of social realities while maintaining artistic expression? These questions are worth exploring when appreciating films, and we also look forward to the film industry bringing more exciting integration of art and reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Doutao large language model isn&amp;rsquo;t very reliable today; it froze several times, and the article got stuck halfway through without allowing me to continue. I had to start a new session.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The two major political parties in the United States—the Democratic Party and the Republican Party</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:40:04 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-two-major-parties-democrats-republicans/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Democratic and Republican parties have significant differences in their political ideologies, policy proposals, and social values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;political-ideology-and-policy-propositions&#34;&gt;Political ideology and policy propositions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Party: leans liberal, advocates for an active role of government in economic and social affairs, supports social welfare, environmental protection, and multiculturalism. On tax policy, the Democratic Party supports tax cuts for middle- and low-income groups while raising taxes on high earners and corporations. On social issues, the Democratic Party supports abortion rights, same-sex marriage, and advocates for strict gun control. In foreign policy, the Democratic Party emphasizes multilateralism and diplomatic means, tending to resolve global issues through international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Republican Party: leans conservative, advocates for limited government intervention, and emphasizes individual freedom and market economy. On tax policy, the Republican Party supports tax cuts, believing that they should apply to everyone regardless of income level. On social issues, the Republican Party opposes abortion and same-sex marriage, and supports the right to bear arms. In foreign policy, the Republican Party tends to take a hard line and supports using military means to protect national interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-significance-of-trump-coming-to-power&#34;&gt;The significance of Trump coming to power
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s re-election as US President in 2024 marks the Republican Party’s dominance in American politics. Trump’s policy stances include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic policy: Trump advocates for stimulating economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation, particularly supporting the development of traditional manufacturing and energy industries. He also tends to adopt protectionist trade policies, renegotiating or withdrawing from existing trade agreements to protect American economic interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immigration policy: Trump plans to strengthen border security, restrict illegal immigration, and impose stricter scrutiny and restrictions on legal immigrants. He also supports limiting refugee and asylum applications in order to protect national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign policy: Trump tends to adopt unilateralism, emphasizing &amp;ldquo;America First,&amp;rdquo; reducing reliance on international organizations, reassessing relations with allies, and taking tougher diplomatic measures when necessary. He also plans to expand the production and use of fossil fuels and relax restrictions on environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second term for Trump could lead to significant adjustments in US domestic policy and have a profound impact on global politics and economics. His policies are likely to draw attention and reactions from the international community, particularly in areas such as trade, environment, and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
