        <description>&lt;p&gt;Driven by the tide of technological innovation, RWA (Real World Assets) and Web3 have become hot topics in the financial industry. Traditional financial institutions – once regarded as conservative and stable giants – are now actively embracing these emerging concepts, vigorously promoting the development of RWA and DeFi (Decentralized Finance). However, behind this technology-driven transformation lies a core question worth pondering: Are these dazzling new concepts truly disruptive innovation, or simply giving traditional financial businesses a “new look”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rwa-and-web3-decoding-core-concepts&#34;&gt;RWA and Web3: Decoding Core Concepts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RWA (Real World Assets), referring to real-world assets,&lt;/strong&gt; are tangible or intangible assets from the physical world that are issued and traded as digital assets on a blockchain through “tokenization” technology. These assets can encompass real estate, bonds, private credit, artwork, carbon credits, and more. Its core value lies in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing Liquidity:&lt;/strong&gt; Dividing illiquid assets (such as real estate) into smaller shares, reducing investment barriers, and enabling them to be traded easily on secondary markets like stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving Transparency and Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; Utilizing blockchain’s immutability and traceability to simplify asset issuance, trading, and settlement processes, reduce intermediaries and human error, ultimately lowering costs and improving efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding Financing Channels:&lt;/strong&gt; Providing asset owners with a globalized, more efficient financing platform, breaking down geographical and traditional financial intermediary restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web3, often referred to as “the next generation internet,”&lt;/strong&gt; has core principles of building a decentralized, user-owned and controlled internet ecosystem. Unlike the Web2 era dominated by a few tech giants, Web3 is based on blockchain technology, aiming to return data ownership and control to users. Its key features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralization:&lt;/strong&gt; Information and applications are no longer stored on single company servers but distributed across numerous nodes in the network, reducing the risk of single points of failure and censorship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Sovereignty:&lt;/strong&gt; Users have greater control over their personal data, choosing with whom to share it and how it is used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permissionless and Censorship-Resistant:&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone can participate in the network, publish applications or use services without needing approval from centralized authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-are-traditional-financial-institutions-embracing-rwa-and-defi&#34;&gt;Why Are Traditional Financial Institutions Embracing RWA and DeFi?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional financial institutions are actively pushing for RWA and DeFi primarily due to the following strategic considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency Gains &amp;amp; Cost Reduction:&lt;/strong&gt; The traditional financial system is characterized by significant manual auditing, complex clearing and settlement processes, and burdensome compliance steps, leading to inefficiency and high costs. Through smart contracts and blockchain technology, DeFi and RWA can automate many of these processes, significantly reducing operational costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating New Revenue Streams &amp;amp; Markets:&lt;/strong&gt; The emergence of RWA has opened up new asset classes and business models for financial institutions. For example, providing tokenized services for real estate or private credit projects, underwriting, and trading can generate new fees and consulting revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responding to Competition &amp;amp; Maintaining Leadership:&lt;/strong&gt; Competition from fintech companies and crypto native enterprises is intensifying. By proactively positioning themselves in RWA and DeFi, traditional financial institutions can demonstrate their innovative capabilities, attract a new generation of clients, and secure a favorable position in the future financial landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing Transparency &amp;amp; Risk Management:&lt;/strong&gt; The transparency offered by blockchain helps improve the visibility of underlying asset information, allowing investors to better assess risks.  Furthermore, standardized token protocols and automated compliance checks can also enhance risk management efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;business-essence-new-wine-in-an-old-bottle&#34;&gt;Business Essence: New Wine in an Old Bottle?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite RWA and DeFi bringing innovation in technology and models, from a core business logic perspective, the current RWA-related businesses undertaken by traditional financial institutions are largely extensions and digital upgrades of their &lt;strong&gt;traditional businesses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking &lt;strong&gt;RWA&lt;/strong&gt; as an example, its core is to tokenize traditional assets. This process bears a striking resemblance to traditional &lt;strong&gt;Asset Securitization (ABS)&lt;/strong&gt;. ABS involves transforming illiquid assets with predictable cash flows into tradable securities in financial markets through packaging and layering. RWA simply shifts the carrier of securitization from traditional electronic certificates to blockchain-based tokens. Its essence remains &lt;strong&gt;credit intermediation and asset management&lt;/strong&gt; – selecting high-quality assets, structuring them, and selling them to investors. For example, packaging the future rental income rights of a commercial property into tokens is no different than issuing Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in terms of its core financial nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in the &lt;strong&gt;DeFi&lt;/strong&gt; sector, although its “decentralized” concept aims to disrupt traditional financial intermediaries, the way current institutions are participating is primarily to &lt;strong&gt;utilize their technological advantages to optimize existing businesses&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, using smart contracts to simplify loan approval and disbursement processes or conducting more efficient cross-border payments and settlements through decentralized exchanges. Its core business of &lt;strong&gt;lending, trading, and payment&lt;/strong&gt; remains the cornerstone of the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can be said that traditional financial institutions driving RWA and DeFi is more like a “self-revolution,” namely, without changing its core financial functions, using new technologies to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and expand markets.&lt;/strong&gt; They are not trying to completely overthrow themselves but rather hope to consolidate and expand their industry position through technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, RWA and Web3 have undoubtedly brought profound changes to the financial industry. They have solved many pain points in traditional finance through technology. However, for traditional financial institutions at this stage, embracing these technologies is more like a cautious and pragmatic strategic choice. Its core business logic has not fundamentally changed, still revolving around assets, credit, and transactions – these ancient financial themes.  As technology matures and regulation improves, we may see more disruptive financial innovations; however, given the current situation, “new wine in an old bottle” is perhaps the most accurate description.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Digital Currency Fundamentals</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/digital-currency-fundamentals/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 19:30:00 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/digital-currency-fundamentals/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We use an easy-to-understand analogy to explain the relationship between digital currency “mining” and “accounting,” as well as why Bitcoin and Ethereum have different supply caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s use an easy-to-understand analogy to explain the relationship between digital currency “mining” and “accounting,” as well as why Bitcoin and Ethereum have different supply caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mining-and-accounting-a-public-participation-ledger-competition&#34;&gt;Mining and Accounting: A Public Participation Ledger Competition
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine the entire Bitcoin network as a massive, public, and transparent electronic ledger. Every Bitcoin transaction (such as Zhang San sending a Bitcoin to Li Si) that occurs anywhere in the world needs to be recorded onto this large ledger for the transaction to be considered successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who records these transactions? If anyone could just write them down arbitrarily, it would become chaotic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, the Bitcoin system has designed an ongoing “accounting competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounting (Bookkeeping)&lt;/strong&gt;: This involves bundling all transactions that have occurred in the past approximately 10 minutes into a &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo; (which can be understood as a page of the ledger). This block not only includes transaction records but also contains a link to the previous &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo; (the previous page of the ledger), linking one page after another to form an immutable chain, which is called “blockchain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mining&lt;/strong&gt;: The core issue is: who has the right to record this page? The answer is: whoever first solves an extremely complex mathematical problem gets the accounting rights for that time. This solving process is形象地称为“mining”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it called &amp;ldquo;Mining&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/strong&gt; Because this process requires a large amount of computing resources (mining machines) and energy (power), just like real-world mining requires equipment and labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the purpose of solving the problem?&lt;/strong&gt; This mathematical problem itself has no practical meaning; its sole purpose is to increase the difficulty of accounting, ensuring that an average person (or a mining pool) can solve it approximately every 10 minutes. This guarantees stable ledger update speed and ensures system security. Anyone who wants to tamper with the ledger must have twice the computing power of the entire network, which is practically impossible economically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, the relationship between mining and accounting can be summarized as:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Mining” is the process of competing for “accounting rights,” while “Accounting” is the reward and responsibility after successfully “mining.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mining-and-accounting-a-public-participation-ledger-competition-1&#34;&gt;Mining and Accounting: A Public Participation Ledger Competition
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful “miners” who successfully mine a block will perform two tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Package the latest transactions into a new block and connect it to the blockchain (completing the accounting).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receive rewards granted by the system.&lt;/strong&gt; This reward consists of two parts:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block Reward:&lt;/strong&gt; The system automatically generates a batch of newly created Bitcoins as a reward. This is the only way that new Bitcoin is created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transaction Fees:&lt;/strong&gt; The fees paid by the payers of all transactions within the block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-does-bitcoin-have-a-cap-while-ethereum-doesnt&#34;&gt;Why Does Bitcoin Have a Cap, While Ethereum Doesn&amp;rsquo;t?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This involves fundamental differences in the design philosophy and objectives of these two cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bitcoin-digital-gold-limited-supply&#34;&gt;Bitcoin: Digital Gold, Limited Supply
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin was designed from the outset to be a &lt;strong&gt;value storage&lt;/strong&gt; tool like gold. Gold is valuable for one key reason: its scarcity – the amount on Earth is finite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To mimic this scarcity, Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, established two immutable rules during design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited Supply:&lt;/strong&gt; The total supply of Bitcoin is permanently limited to &lt;strong&gt;21 million coins&lt;/strong&gt;. Not a fraction more, not a fraction less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Halving Production:&lt;/strong&gt; Approximately every four years (or with every 210,000 blocks mined), the block reward earned by miners will be reduced in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2009 began at 50 BTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2012 halving to 25 BTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2016 halving to 12.5 BTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2020 halving to 6.25 BTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2024 halving to 3.125 BTC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…and so on, until approximately 2140, when the new reward will approach zero indefinitely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design gives Bitcoin &lt;strong&gt;deflationary&lt;/strong&gt; characteristics. Over time, the output of new coins decreases, and if demand remains constant or increases, its value theoretically rises. This reinforces its positioning as “digital gold.” Once all bitcoins have been mined, miners’ income will depend entirely on transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ethereum-decentralized-application-platform-more-flexible-supply-strategy&#34;&gt;Ethereum: Decentralized Application Platform, More Flexible Supply Strategy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethereum’s goals differ from Bitcoin. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a digital currency; it’s a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;world computer,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; a platform designed to run smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can imagine Ethereum as a decentralized “app store” and “operating system.” Within this system, you need to pay “gas fees” to run your programs or make transactions, and this gas is Ether (ETH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maintain this vast and complex system, Ethereum continuously incentivizes miners (now validators) to protect the network’s security. If a hard cap were set like Bitcoin’s, with no new coins being mined after it&amp;rsquo;s finished, whether transaction fees alone would be sufficient to guarantee the network’s long-term security is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Ethereum chose a &lt;strong&gt;no-hard-cap&lt;/strong&gt; strategy. However, this doesn’t mean it will experience unlimited inflation. Ethereum’s monetary policy has undergone several significant adjustments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early (Proof-of-Work PoW)&lt;/strong&gt;: Similar to Bitcoin, new coins were generated through mining, but there was no fixed total limit or set halving cycle. This resulted in a relatively high inflation rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;London Upgrade (EIP-1559)&lt;/strong&gt;: Introduced an “burn fee” mechanism. A portion of the base fees paid by users for transactions would be directly “burned” (permanently removed from circulation) instead of going to miners. This meant that when the network was active with transactions, the amount of ETH burned could exceed the newly issued amount, leading to &lt;strong&gt;deflation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Merge (The Merge)&lt;/strong&gt;: Ethereum transitioned from “mining” (Proof-of-Work PoW) to “staking” (Proof-of-Stake PoS). No longer do miners expend electricity solving problems; instead, “validators” earn accounting rights and rewards by staking their own ETH. This shift &lt;strong&gt;significantly reduced the issuance rate of new ETH&lt;/strong&gt; (over 90%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary, here are Ethereum’s key characteristics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Hard Cap&lt;/strong&gt;: Provides flexibility for the network&amp;rsquo;s long-term security and development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Supply&lt;/strong&gt;: Through “burn mechanisms” and “staking rewards,” its total supply can be mildly inflationary or experience deflation during periods of high transaction activity. Its goal isn’t absolute scarcity, but rather to &lt;strong&gt;maintain sufficient security while ensuring ETH remains available as “fuel.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>What is a Stablecoin?</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/what-is-a-stablecoin/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 23:43:19 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/what-is-a-stablecoin/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins have already gained legal status in the United States and Hong Kong. This allows for more efficient capital flows globally, and gray areas are bound to exist if not regulated – similar to how the US manages opioid addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins are crypto assets pegged to fiat currencies (such as the US dollar or Hong Kong dollar) or precious metals, designed to maintain their value stability. They are primarily divided into three categories: fiat-backed (such as USDT, USDC), commodity-backed (like stablecoins backed by gold reserves), and algorithmic (which do not rely on physical reserves but instead use algorithms to maintain their peg)([zh.wikipedia.org][1])&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-why-should-legislation-support-stablecoins&#34;&gt;🛠️ Why Should Legislation Support Stablecoins?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-enhance-payment-efficiency-and-reduce-costs&#34;&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Enhance Payment Efficiency and Reduce Costs&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins can provide instant, low-cost cross-border payment services, particularly in areas where banks are not covered. Their settlement speed is fast, fees are low, and they offer significant value for international trade and remittances ([ft.com][2]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-strengthening-the-internationalization-of-the-us-dollar--currency&#34;&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Strengthening the Internationalization of the US Dollar / Currency&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an American perspective, the rise of stablecoins can increase demand for short-term assets like U.S. Treasuries, thereby solidifying the dollar’s position and simultaneously driving financial innovation. The EU is also taking advantage of this opportunity to accelerate the launch of a digital euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-addressing-regulatory-gaps-and-mitigating-risks&#34;&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Addressing Regulatory Gaps and Mitigating Risks&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, stablecoins have largely operated in the “shadow financial” system, lacking transparency and plagued by market irregularities, even involving risks such as money laundering and fraud. The U.S. proposed STABLE Act and GENIUS Act require clear regulation, disclosure of reserves, and capital/liquidation rules to ensure financial security and investor protection ([morganlewis.com][3]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong, meanwhile, has begun implementing the “Stablecoins Ordinance” from August 2025, requiring stablecoin issuers to obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and meet standards for reserves, redemptions, and anti-money laundering (AML/CFT), as well as prohibiting unlicensed institutions from advertising promotions ([morganlewis.com][4]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-stablecoin-companies-make-money&#34;&gt;How Do Stablecoin Companies Make Money?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest Income on Reserve Assets&lt;/strong&gt;
For example, Circle’s USDC reserves are largely held in short-term US Treasury bonds, benefiting from current interest rates. In 2023, profits increased significantly, and approximately $5 billion in profit was projected for 2025 (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.ft.com/content/eb588992-ece3-4254-b2ea-721a20bf1180?utm_source=chatgpt.com&#34;  title=&#34;Lessons from a stablecoin IPO: tech turns on a dime&#34;
     target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;ft.com&lt;/a&gt;) . Tether’s report showed earnings of $5.2 billion in the first half of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transaction Fees and Developer Tool Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;
In addition to minting/redemption fees, stablecoin platforms generate stable revenue by providing APIs, SDKs, settlement tools, etc., for DeFi, wallets, and corporate clients (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stablecoin-supply-is-growing-fast-heres-how-it-compares-to-cash-66f12bc1?utm_source=chatgpt.com&#34;  title=&#34;Stablecoin supply is growing fast. Here&amp;#39;s how it compares to cash.&#34;
     target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;marketwatch.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Expansion Services&lt;/strong&gt;
Some stablecoin issuers profit through additional products (such as interest redemption, investment features, corporate settlements, etc.), but this may lead to regulatory restrictions on “interest-bearing stablecoins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-summary&#34;&gt;✅ Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stablecoins&lt;/strong&gt; are payment tools designed to mitigate the volatility of cryptocurrencies, maintaining value through reserves or algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory legislation&lt;/strong&gt; aims to promote compliance, protect consumers, maintain financial stability, and foster innovation and international competitiveness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue models&lt;/strong&gt; primarily derive from interest on reserve assets, fees, and value-added services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, if regulated effectively, stablecoins could play a significant role in global payment systems and compete with Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).&lt;/p&gt;
