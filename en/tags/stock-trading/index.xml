        <title>Wide Base Exponential Fixed Investment (also known as “Bullet Strategy”): Brokerage ETF, Heng Seng Tech Index</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/broad-based-index-etf-investing/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve always wanted to do things, like buying a suitable blue-chip stock and just letting it sit, waiting for it to drop so I could assess the situation before adding more, and selling when it rose. The result was that I never managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding an appropriate blue-chip stock is troublesome; instead, choosing a broad market index ETF would suffice. My current plan is: a brokerage ETF and the Hong Kong Tech Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of trading strategy described above has a professional term: “bottom fishing” (buying back when the price is falling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what’s next, my plan is to choose a broad market index to thoroughly practice it – achieving an annualized return that outperforms regular savings account interest rates would be the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brokerage-etfs&#34;&gt;Brokerage ETFs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brokerage ETF is an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) whose primary investment target is Chinese securities companies. It primarily invests in the listed stocks of Chinese securities companies in the stock market. Brokerage ETFs typically track a specific brokerage company index, such as the China Securities Brokerage Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I previously bought one, but it was at a peak and ultimately resulted in losses, so I liquidated my position. In the Chinese market, whenever there’s a bull run, brokerage companies are bound to rise – and by how much, depends on investor sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-tech-index&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Tech Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index is an equity index launched by the Hong Kong Exchange, designed to reflect the overall performance of the technology industry in Hong Kong markets. The index includes major technology companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, covering areas such as internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 20, 2025, the top ten constituent stocks of the Hang Seng Tech Index (code: 800700) and their weightings are listed below (data sourced from multiple authoritative sources):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xiaomi Group-W&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://01810.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;01810.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 8.82%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tencent Holdings&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://00700.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;00700.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 8.14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alibaba-W&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09988.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09988.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 7.72%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JD Group-SW&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09618.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09618.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 7.60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meituan-W&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://03690.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;03690.HK&lt;/a&gt;): approximately 7.35%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kuaishou-W&lt;/strong&gt; ([01024.HK](http://01024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-tech-index-1&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Tech Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASML Holding&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://00981.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;00981.HK&lt;/a&gt;): Approx. 5.70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NetEase-S&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09999.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09999.HK&lt;/a&gt;): Approx. 4.59%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ctrip Group-S&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://09961.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;09961.HK&lt;/a&gt;): Approx. 4.48%
&lt;strong&gt;Total Percentage:&lt;/strong&gt; Approx. 66.6% (Note: Some sources show the top ten combined percentage between 68%-69%, due to differences in statistical timing.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-notes&#34;&gt;Key Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight Cap Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;: The Hang Seng Tech Index sets an 8% weight limit for individual stocks. For example, before the adjustment on March 2025, SMIC’s weighting exceeded 8%, but was subsequently passively reduced to comply with the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constituent Stock Adjustments&lt;/strong&gt;: On May 16, 2025, the Hang Seng Index Company announced that BYD ( &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://01211.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;01211.HK&lt;/a&gt; ) will be included in the index and Shun Hing Assets ( &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://00772.HK&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;00772.HK&lt;/a&gt; ) will be excluded. The adjustment will take effect on June 6th. Therefore, as of today (May 20th), the constituent stocks are based on the pre-adjustment list, and BYD has not yet been included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry Distribution&lt;/strong&gt;: Among the top ten constituent stocks, internet technology companies (such as Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan) dominate, with new energy vehicles (Xiaomi, Ideal) and semiconductors (SMIC) having significant weights, reflecting the index’s coverage of technology and the new economy. &lt;strong&gt;Data Timeliness:&lt;/strong&gt; The primary differences in data from various sources stem from differing statistical time points. For example, data from March 2025 showed a combined top ten share of approximately 69.4%, while data from May 14th indicated 68.82%, reflecting the dynamic impact of market fluctuations on the weighting distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;short-put-cover&#34;&gt;Short Put Cover
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Short Put Cover” strategy is an investment approach where investors, anticipating a stock price approaching its bottom as it continues to decline, actively buy in batches to reduce their cost basis and wait for future price recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method falls under the category of “short trading,” which involves counter-trend operations before the market has clearly found its bottom. Specifically, investors typically employ a “pyramidal” layering strategy – gradually increasing the purchase quantity as the stock price declines, thereby reducing the average cost basis of their holdings. For example, initially buying a certain number of shares, if the price continues to fall, the investor increases the purchase volume at a lower price, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce Cost Basis:&lt;/strong&gt; By purchasing in batches during the decline, you reduce the average cost basis of your holdings, creating conditions for future profits. - &lt;strong&gt;Strategic Positioning (Early Layout):&lt;/strong&gt; Establishing positions before the market reverses, aiming to realize greater profits when the market rebounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; If stock prices continue to fall, it could lead to larger losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital Tie-up:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires sufficient funds to continuously add to positions and may face a situation where capital is long-term blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively speaking, “right-side trading” involves buying after the market trend becomes clear and there are definite signs of an upward movement in stock prices, which carries lower risk but could miss out on some initial gains during a rebound. Therefore, investors should choose a strategy suitable for their risk tolerance, capital situation, and market judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory&#34;&gt;Valuation Theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuation theory is a core concept in finance that aims to assess the intrinsic value of assets or companies, providing a basis for investment decisions. Through valuation, investors can determine whether the current market price of an asset is reasonable and develop appropriate investment strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Valuation Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by an asset over its future period and discounts these cash flows to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The DCF method emphasizes intrinsic value and is suitable for evaluating companies with stable and predictable earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative Valuation Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method assesses a company’s relative value by comparing valuation metrics such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, and Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio with those of other companies in the same industry. - Relative Valuation Method is straightforward to operate, widely used for rapid assessment and comparison within the same industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asset Basis Method:&lt;/strong&gt; This method determines a company’s value by evaluating its net assets – total assets minus liabilities. The Asset Basis Method is suitable for asset-driven companies such as real estate firms or capital-intensive businesses.
&lt;strong&gt;Application of Valuation Theories:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Decisions:&lt;/strong&gt; Through valuation, investors can identify undervalued or overvalued assets and develop buy or sell strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate Mergers &amp;amp; Acquisitions:&lt;/strong&gt; In M&amp;amp;A transactions, valuation is key to determining the transaction price and influences the success or failure of the deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory-1&#34;&gt;Valuation Theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Reporting:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies need to assess the fair value of their assets and liabilities to ensure the accuracy and transparency of financial statements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that valuation results are influenced by various factors, including market conditions, company operations, macroeconomic indicators, etc. Therefore, when conducting a valuation, it is necessary to consider all factors comprehensively and combine qualitative and quantitative analysis to obtain a more accurate assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>“Making an investment and making money isn’t urgent, and even if you’re anxious, it won’t help.”</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:30:24 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on years of stock trading experiences, although I didn’t make a fortune, I also didn&amp;rsquo;t lose too much. The biggest issue was an unreasonable allocation of funds and an unstable mindset. Currently, my primary source of income is work, earning a fixed salary each day through part-time jobs. My ability to withstand financial fluctuations remains at the level of bonds and bank deposits. However, people are inherently greedy; if you buy too little, even when prices rise, you won’t make money; if you buy too much, you will lose money. At this point, maintaining a stable mindset is particularly important, as it can help us keep our wealth afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt: Write an article: Addressing the mental issues in stock trading finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-loss-cases&#34;&gt;Historical Loss Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the initial entry into the market, I’ve encountered small-cap and near-new stocks. Later, my investments focused primarily on blue-chip large-cap stocks: Industrial Bank, China Unicom, HK Electronics, ZTESC, and various large index funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Expecting an annualized return while hearing bullish calls about matching a bank&amp;rsquo;s three-year fixed deposit,” in reality, it was driven by greed wanting more, leading to hasty increases in positions followed by depletion of cash flow. Purchases of insurance, real estate, and weddings represented significant capital outflows, and overall, there wasn’t enough liquidity allocated for these investments, resulting in insufficient funds later on. Buying blue chips is like aligning with “old money”—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Evergrande ran into trouble, bank stocks plummeted dramatically, successfully capitalizing on the opportunity to clear out positions. This reflects a lack of understanding regarding the impact on the broader economy. The real estate sector’s dominance within China&amp;rsquo;s economic landscape necessitates avoiding a hard landing; consequently, continued stock market declines affected red-chip stocks like &lt;strong&gt;Industrial Bank&lt;/strong&gt;, which rose for about two years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the initial stages of the trade war, &lt;strong&gt;Zhongxing&lt;/strong&gt; was severely impacted, and its share price also fell sharply. It has since gradually recovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HSPE (Hubei Hongyu Electronic)&lt;/strong&gt; is a legacy company; after Ant Group’s departure, its stock price also plummeted significantly. However, this stock benefits from market manipulation by a major shareholder, which allows it to surge several times per year. With reasonable position control, losses can be minimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;greed-the-monster-devouring-reason&#34;&gt;Greed: The “Monster” Devouring Reason
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greed is the most common problem in a stock trading mindset.&lt;/strong&gt; When stock prices rise steadily, and investors’ account profits continuously increase, greed quietly takes root. Many people still fantasize about continued upward movement of stocks even when they are already at high levels, craving more gains, and refusing to cut their profits. They are blinded by greed, forgetting the existence of market rules and risks. For example, during the hype of certain hot-topic stocks, some investors see a doubling or even several times increase in prices over a short period, and become trapped, constantly adding to their positions, hoping to be the last winner. However, the market will not always go crazy; when the bubble bursts and stock prices plummet sharply, these investors driven by greed often suffer heavy losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-the-chains-that-restrict&#34;&gt;Fear: The “Chains” That Restrict
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is the counterpart to greed. It possesses a powerful destructive force in the stock market as well. When market conditions suddenly reverse and stock prices plummet dramatically, investors are prone to panic. This fear erodes their confidence in the market, even when the fundamentals of their holdings are sound, leading them to hastily sell off their shares out of a fear of further losses. For example, during periods of global financial crises, even high-quality blue-chip stocks saw significant declines alongside the broader market. Some investors were consumed by fear and failed to recognize the long-term value of these companies, selling their stock at extremely low prices and missing out on the substantial returns that came with subsequent market rebounds and company performance growth. Fear not only causes short-term losses for investors but can also create a lasting psychological shadow over the stock market, making them hesitant to re-enter investments and thus losing out on investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blind-following-losing-direction-in-the-fog&#34;&gt;Blind Following: Losing Direction in the &amp;ldquo;Fog&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stock trading and wealth management, blindly following trends is another psychological pitfall that investors easily fall into. In an era of information overload, various investment suggestions, market rumors, and hot topics are rampant. Many investors lack independent thinking and judgment abilities, blindly following others&amp;rsquo; operations. When they see their peers making money by buying a particular stock, they immediately follow suit without further thought; when they hear so-called &amp;ldquo;insider news,&amp;rdquo; they readily share it. This blind following behavior ignores the research and analysis of the underlying stocks, causing investors to be like lost ships in the fog, losing their own direction. For example, some momentum stocks can generate short-term gains for followers during the initial market hype. However, as the hype fades and stock prices plummet, those investors who lack understanding and blindly follow become “pickup operators.” They fail to realize that each investor’s risk tolerance, investment objectives, and investment horizon are different; an investment strategy suitable for one person may not be suitable for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overconfidence-the-hidden-rocks&#34;&gt;Overconfidence: The Hidden “Rocks”
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence is also a significant issue in the investment and financial mindset. Some investors, after achieving several successful investments, begin to inflate their egos, believing they have mastered market patterns and can accurately predict stock movements. They ignore the complexity and uncertainty of the market, engage in excessive trading, blindly expand their investment scale, and even use high leverage for speculation. However, the market is ever-changing, and overconfident investors often suffer severe setbacks in a single unexpected market fluctuation. For example, some investors with limited experience who achieved an initial victory believe they possess professional investment capabilities and begin to frequently buy and sell stocks, continuously increasing their investment amount. When systemic risks or sudden negative news about individual stocks emerge, they fail to cut their losses promptly due to overconfidence, leading to a significant reduction in their principal amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-for-stable-investing&#34;&gt;How to Adjust Your Mindset for Stable Investing
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish the Right Investment Philosophy: Investors should clearly understand that stock investing and wealth management are aimed at achieving long-term, stable asset appreciation, not overnight riches. By learning investment knowledge, understanding market rules, adopting value investing and long-term investment philosophies, and avoiding being swayed by short-term profits and market sentiment, you can make informed decisions. For example, thoroughly research a company’s fundamentals, paying attention to its profitability, industry position, management team, and other relevant factors, choosing stocks with long-term investment potential rather than blindly chasing short-term trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a Reasonable Investment Plan: Based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals, create a scientific and reasonable investment plan. Clearly define key elements such as the amount to invest, the investment timeframe, expected returns, and stop-loss points, and strictly execute according to the plan. This can help avoid impulsive decisions made due to emotional fluctuations during investment. For example, set the investment proportion of each stock to no more than a certain percentage of total assets, and promptly take profits when the price rises to reach the expected return, and decisively cut losses when it falls to the stop-loss point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control emotions and remain calm: When facing market volatility, you need to learn to control your own emotions, maintain calmness and rationality. You can relieve investment pressure by diverting attention, engaging in physical exercise, or communicating with others, avoiding negative impacts of emotion on investment decisions. When the market experiences a significant fluctuation, first calmly analyze the reasons, combine them with your investment strategy and stock fundamentals, and make rational judgments instead of blindly following trends or panic selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-for-steady-wealth-management&#34;&gt;How to Adjust Your Mindset for Steady Wealth Management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous Learning and Reflection: The stock market is constantly evolving, and investors need to continuously learn new investment knowledge and skills, paying attention to macroeconomic trends, industry dynamics, and company information, and constantly improving their investment level. At the same time, it’s important to regularly reflect on your investment behavior, summarize experiences and lessons learned, identify problems in your mindset and decision-making, and promptly adjust and improve them. For example, after each investment, review the entire process, analyze the reasons for success and failure, and think about how to avoid similar mistakes in future investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in stocks and wealth management is a long and challenging journey, and mindset plays a crucial role. Only by maintaining a rational, calm, humble, and independent-thinking mindset can you steadily progress through the stock market’s fluctuations and achieve the preservation and appreciation of your wealth. ## How to Adjust Your Mindset for Steady Financial Planning&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>“Increased scrutiny of third-party advisor regulation, and the beneficiaries behind the ‘Douyin (TikTok) stock trading’ phenomenon face a crackdown?”</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/third-party-wealth-managers-scrutiny-tiktok-stock-winners-crackdown/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:59:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/third-party-wealth-managers-scrutiny-tiktok-stock-winners-crackdown/</guid>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hammer is falling.
Following the wind of short videos, investment advisory services are reportedly entering a fast lane.
In late September this year, after a period of intense activity in the A-share market, recommendations on Douyin (TikTok) have attracted attention from various parties.
Several financial commentators have risen to prominence on Douyin, indirectly causing some volatility in the capital markets.
However, the rapid rise of these commentators is not to be ignored – it’s largely driven by third-party investment advisory firms.
It&amp;rsquo;s understood that many third-party investment advisory firms operate multiple accounts on short video platforms, using content distribution (投流) to attract users to watch investment teaching videos and boost enthusiasm for purchasing corresponding advisory products.
There are even rumors that one third-party investment advisory firm generated 10 billion yuan in revenue in October alone, exceeding its first-half earnings this year.
But “good times” are facing more uncertainties. Since November, multiple departments have successively issued notices requiring securities service institutions to strengthen the compliant management of their self-media accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of November 15th, Tianhong Securities (300033.SZ) announced that its subsidiary was penalized by the China Securities Regulatory Commission for engaging in behavior such as hinting at recommending stocks through livestreaming operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be signaling to the market a stricter regulatory approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expansion prospects of third-party investment advisory service institutions, such as JiuFang Zhitu (9636.HK), are also likely to face greater pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tight-regulation-monitoring&#34;&gt;Tight Regulation Monitoring
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of short video platforms like Douyin (TikTok) has amplified emotional voices and indirectly impacted trading behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Giant League of Finance’s monitoring, from September 27th to October 8th, when transaction volumes hit record highs, the Douyin A-share keyword search index soared from 4.2384 million to 12.7786 million, expanding by more than twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under such circumstances, the “pushing and pulling” behavior of third-party investment advisory firms is attracting the attention of regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice of investment advisors recommending individual stocks through various methods during live broadcasts is a high-frequency violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 8th, the Guangdong Securities Regulatory Bureau took regulatory measures to suspend new clients for a company that was found to be “hinting at stock recommendations” during a live broadcast. On November 14th, the Guangdong Securities Futures业协会 (Guangdong Securities and Futures Association) issued a notice titled “Live Streaming Control Issues Lead to Suspension of Business for Institutions,” directly addressing instances where some institutions with securities consulting qualifications exhibited inadequate control during live streaming operations. The notice also cited instances of recommending individual stocks within the live streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The practice of recommending stocks through live streaming is strictly prohibited. Given that live streaming constitutes public media dissemination, all individuals, regardless of whether they are registered as securities investment advisors, shall not recommend individual stocks during live streams.” The Guangdong Securities Futures业协会 stated this clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an isolated incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, the Shanghai Securities Regulatory Commission (SRRC) disclosed a penalty notice that also involved illegal stock recommendations on social media platforms.  An investigation by regulators revealed that Wang Yong, a consultant at Haishun Securities Investment Consulting Co., Ltd.’s Shanghai branch, used WeChat Video No. to publicly disseminate misleading video content, violating professional conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to information obtained by Wind (ID: TradeWind01), some ineligible investment advisory firms were using “front-running” brokers (ID:TradeWind01) on Douyin (TikTok) to recommend stocks, and they have since been suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Individuals in the industry are livestreaming, but they are actually operating under the umbrella of a broker-dealer, which allows them to obtain investment advisor qualifications. They then use these livestreams to generate leads and sell advisory product bundles,” said a consultant based in South China to Wind (ID: TradeWind01). “However, because they were recommending stocks during the livestream, it was discovered, leading to their suspension. Regular broker-dealers typically discuss sector trends during investment education livestreams but do not delve into individual stock recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, regulators are maintaining a high level of vigilance regarding illegal stock recommendations on social media platforms. For example, recent notices from the Shenzhen Securities Regulatory Commission have revealed that some individual institutions or individuals are engaging in illegal stock promotion through self-media, among other violations. To further regulate self-media operations of securities investment consulting agencies within its jurisdiction, all institutions must strengthen their company’s self-media management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may pose more challenges for third-party wealth management service providers&amp;rsquo; business expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-flow-business-is-a-scam&#34;&gt;“The Flow Business” is a Scam
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether retail investors attracted by short videos have made money remains unknown, but the valuation of third-party investment advisory service companies as &amp;ldquo;water sellers&amp;rdquo; in the secondary market has soared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As China’s “first online investor education stock,” JiuFang Intelligence’s market capitalization rose from 2878 million yuan on September 9th to 12464 million yuan on November 13th, with an increase of 333.08% over 49 trading days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The semi-annual report shows that in the first half of the year, JiuFang Intelligence conducted brand exposure on social media platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu, and by June 30th, it had 488 accounts and 46 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, as JiuFang Intelligence’s Chief Investment Advisor, “Hongbangzhu” (a nickname) has 2.26 million followers on Douyin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We deeply cultivate MCN operations, focusing on the user-centric approach, and synergistically promote the comprehensive development of traffic, brands, and products.” “Nine Fang Intelligence Investment pointed out, “By deeply integrating new media tools such as live streaming and short videos, leveraging AI technology to build fan networks, and actively exploring e-commerce models, we effectively achieve the efficient conversion of traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine Fang Intelligence Investment’s investment consultant course packages cover a price range from several hundred yuan to over ten万元 (approximately $1.5 million). The most expensive package, “Super Investor,” priced at 13.96万元 ($2.0 million) for six months, includes exclusive insights and private consulting services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Nine Fang Intelligence Investment’s investment consultant products have a return rate exceeding 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2024, the return rates for the flagship series and “Nine Fang Intelligent Dragon” series reached 14.7% and 18.5%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the impact of regulatory headwinds on Nine Fang Intelligence Investment’s business expansion remains to be observed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-flow-business-is-false&#34;&gt;“The Flow Business” is False
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, media reports have stated that accounts belonging to third-party custodians such as Jiu Fang Zhi Tu (Nine Wise Investment) have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, a report by a media outlet claimed &amp;ldquo;Hong Bangzhu&amp;rdquo; (a popular livestreamer) was suspended from streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on November 15th at 3:00 PM, Xin Feng (ID: TradeWind01) searched the account and found that the “Hong Bangzhu” livestream interface still allowed bookings for a live stream on November 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, market news indicated that relevant authorities have intervened to inspect Jiu Fang Zhi Tu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a source close to Jiu Fang Zhi Tu told Xin Feng (ID: TradeWind01) that the inspection was a routine check and had already concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only company embroiled in rumors surrounding this regulatory storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reports that Tianhong Securities has been investigated for illegal stock recommendations and may be suspended from operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Tianhong Securities stated on November 15th that “there were no illegal stock recommendation cases and no investigation was initiated.” “However, that evening, Tianhe Securities announced that its subsidiary, Zhejiang Tianhe Securities Cloud Software Co., Ltd., was penalized by the Zhejiang Securities Regulatory Bureau for violations during its livestreaming promotional activities, specifically due to inadequate compliance controls and instances of hinting at recommended stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may also signify a further escalation in regulatory scrutiny regarding stock recommendations on social media platforms like Douyin (TikTok) Live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the short video market is attracting many brokerage firms, but due to compliance requirements, brokers are currently being cautious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-flow-business-is-forbidden&#34;&gt;“The Flow Business” is Forbidden
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A securities industry insider told Wind Info (ID:TradeWind01) that the company was exploring short video operations and lead generation methods, and had organized personnel to visit short video platform companies for learning. However, due to regulatory compliance requirements, it is currently in an exploratory phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, behind the various regulatory compliance requirements, is because short video content has a distinctly emotional color. But investors need to maintain rationality when dealing with it, and there is a natural conflict between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If emotional forces influence capital markets, it can easily trigger violent market fluctuations, which goes against the long-term healthy development of capital markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What way should securities firms embrace the arrival of the short video era to avoid “crossing the red line”? It’s clearly a difficult question for all parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
