        <title>Broad-based index investing: Broker ETF, Hang Seng Tech Index</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/etf-wide-index-dzt-broker-etfs-hangsheng-tech-index/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to do this – buy a good blue-chip stock and just leave it alone. But I waited for it to fall, didn&amp;rsquo;t add to my position, and sold when it rose. As a result, I never managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s more trouble than it&amp;rsquo;s worth to find suitable blue-chip stocks; instead, just pick a broad market index and buy an ETF. The current plan is: securities ETF, Hang Seng Tech Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trading strategy has a professional term: left-side dip buying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the plan is to choose a broad-based index for thorough practice; it just needs to outperform the returns of fixed deposits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brokerage-etfs&#34;&gt;Brokerage ETFs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securities ETF refers to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with China&amp;rsquo;s securities companies as their primary investment target, primarily investing in listed securities company stocks in the Chinese stock market. Securities ETFs typically track a specific securities company index, such as the Zhongxin Securities Company Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought it before, but I chased after the high price at that time and ended up losing money, so I just cleared out the position. In China&amp;rsquo;s market, every bull market sees securities firms rise; how much they rise depends on the sentiment of investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hang-seng-technology-index&#34;&gt;Hang Seng Technology Index
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Tech Index is a stock index launched by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, designed to reflect the overall performance of the technology sector in the Hong Kong market. The index includes major tech companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, covering multiple fields such as the internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of May 20, 2025, the top ten constituents and their respective weightings in the Hang Seng Tech Index (code: 800700) are as follows (data compiled from multiple authoritative sources):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xiaomi Group-W (01810.HK): Approximately 8.82%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tencent Holdings (00700.HK): Approximately 8.14%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alibaba Group - W (09988.HK): Approximately 7.72%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JD Group-SW (09618.HK): Approximately 7.60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meituan-W (03690.HK): Approximately 7.35%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kuaishou-W (01024.HK): Approximately 6.10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Li Auto (02015.HK): Approximately 6.09%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SMIC (00981.HK): Approximately 5.70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NetEase-S (09999.HK): Approximately 4.59%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ctrip Group-S (09961.HK): Approximately 4.48%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 66.6% (Some sources indicate a combined share of the top ten between 68%-69%, with differences due to varying statistical time points)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;important-notes&#34;&gt;Important Notes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The weighting cap mechanism: The Hang Seng Technology Index sets an 8% upper limit on the weight of individual stocks. For example, SMIC&amp;rsquo;s weighting once exceeded 8% before its March 2025 adjustment, but was subsequently passively reduced to a compliant range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constituent Stock Adjustment: On May 16, 2025, Hang Seng Index Company announced that BYD (01211.HK) will be included in the index and Century Golden Resource (00772.HK) will be removed. The adjustment will take effect on June 6. Therefore, as of today (May 20), the constituent stock list remains the pre-adjustment list, and BYD has not yet been included.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Among the top ten constituents, internet technology companies (such as Tencent, Alibaba, and Meituan) are dominant, with significant weighting in new energy vehicles (Xiaomi, Li Auto) and semiconductors (SMIC), reflecting the index&amp;rsquo;s coverage of technology and the new economy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data timeliness: Differences in data from different sources are mainly due to varying statistical time points. For example, data from March 2025 shows that the top ten combined accounted for approximately 69.4%, while data from May 14th showed 68.82%, reflecting the dynamic impact of market fluctuations on weighting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buy-back-to-cover-losses-on-the-left-side&#34;&gt;Buy back to cover losses on the left side
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;left-side falling price replenishment&amp;rdquo; strategy is an investment approach where, during a period of continuous stock price decline, investors anticipate the price nearing a bottoming zone and proactively purchase in batches to reduce holding costs, awaiting future price rebounds for profit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method falls under the category of &amp;ldquo;left-side trading,&amp;rdquo; which means taking a contrarian position before the market has clearly bottomed out. In practice, investors typically employ a “pyramid” accumulation strategy, gradually increasing their purchase quantity as the price declines to reduce their average holding cost. For example, initially buying a certain number of shares; if the price continues to fall, then increasing the buy volume at a lower price, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce holding costs: By buying in batches during a downturn, average stock cost is diluted, creating conditions for future profits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positioning in advance: Establishing a position before the market reverses; if the judgment is correct, greater returns can be achieved when the market recovers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High risk: Continued decline in stock price may lead to greater losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding requirements: Requires sufficient funds to support continuous replenishment, and may face a situation where funds are locked up for an extended period&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatively speaking, &amp;ldquo;right-side trading&amp;rdquo; involves entering buy positions after the market trend is clear and there are obvious signs of price recovery, which carries relatively low risk but may miss some of the gains from the early stages of a rebound. Therefore, investors should choose a suitable trading strategy based on their risk tolerance, financial situation, and market judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;valuation-theory&#34;&gt;Valuation theory
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valuation theory is a core concept in finance, designed to assess the intrinsic value of assets or companies and provide a basis for investment decisions. Through valuation, investors can determine whether the current market price of an asset is reasonable and formulate corresponding investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main valuation methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discounted Cash Flow (DCF): This method is based on the expected future cash flows generated by an asset, which are then discounted to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. The DCF method emphasizes the intrinsic value of an asset and is suitable for evaluating companies with stable and predictable profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative Valuation: This method assesses a company&amp;rsquo;s relative value by comparing its valuation metrics with those of other companies in the same industry, such as price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), price-to-book ratio (P/B), and price-to-sales ratio (P/S). Relative valuation is easy to operate and widely used for quick assessments and comparisons within an industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asset-based approach determines a company&amp;rsquo;s value by assessing its net asset value, which is the difference between total assets and liabilities. This method is suitable for asset-dominant companies such as real estate firms or capital-intensive businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application of Valuation Theory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment decisions: Through valuation, investors can identify undervalued or overvalued assets and formulate buy-or-sell strategies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mergers and Acquisitions: In M&amp;amp;A transactions, valuation is key to determining the transaction price and influencing the success or failure of the deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Report: The company needs to assess its assets and liabilities at fair value to ensure the accuracy and transparency of financial reports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that valuation results are affected by various factors, including market conditions, company operating status, and macroeconomic indicators. Therefore, when conducting a valuation, it is necessary to comprehensively consider all factors and combine qualitative and quantitative analysis to obtain more accurate assessment results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Making money takes time; rushing it is useless</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:30:24 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/investing-takes-time/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking back on my years of stock trading experience, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t made a lot of money, I haven&amp;rsquo;t lost too much either. The biggest problem lies in the unreasonable capital flow planning and unstable mindset. Currently, my main source of income is work, earning a fixed salary through daily labor, and my tolerance for financial fluctuations still remains at the level of bonds and bank deposits. However, people are greedy; if you buy too little, you won&amp;rsquo;t make money even when prices rise; if you buy too much, you’ll lose money when they fall. At this point, a stable mindset becomes particularly important, as it can help us steady our ship of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing an article: The issue of mentality in stock investment and wealth management&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-loss-cases&#34;&gt;Historical Loss Cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides dabbling in small-cap and newly listed stocks when I first started, the subsequent investments have mostly been in blue-chip large-cap stocks: Industrial Bank, China Unicom, Hengan Electronics, ZTE, and various large-cap index funds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They talk about matching bank three-year fixed deposits in terms of annualized returns, but in reality, it&amp;rsquo;s still greed for more, from rushing to increase holdings to eventually experiencing a cash flow shortage. Purchasing insurance, buying a house, and getting married are major drains on funds; the overall planning didn’t leave enough room for cash flow, leading to insufficient funds later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying blue-chip stocks is aligning yourself with &amp;ldquo;Old Money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Evergrande ran into problems, bank stocks plummeted, allowing for a successful grasp of the selling pressure. However, this demonstrates a flawed understanding of the broader economy; real estate&amp;rsquo;s share in the national economy is too large, involving too many things to allow for a &lt;strong&gt;hard landing&lt;/strong&gt;. Subsequently, the stock market continued its decline, and dividend stocks like &lt;strong&gt;Industrial Bank&lt;/strong&gt; rose steadily for about two years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the initial stage of the trade war, &lt;strong&gt;ZTE&lt;/strong&gt; suffered a major blow, with its stock price plummeting significantly, but it gradually recovered afterward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hang Seng Electronics used to be part of a larger group, and the stock price dropped significantly after Ant Financial spun off. However, this stock is controlled by market makers, and it can surge several times each year. With reasonable position control, losses will be minimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;greed-the-monster-that-devours-reason&#34;&gt;Greed: The &amp;ldquo;Monster&amp;rdquo; That Devours Reason
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greed is the most common problem in stock trading psychology. When stock prices rise steadily and investors&amp;rsquo; paper profits continue to increase, greed quietly takes root. Many people, even when the price has already reached a high level, still fantasize about it continuing to rise, eager to obtain more gains, and are reluctant to take profits. They are blinded by greed, forgetting the laws of the market and the existence of risk. For example, in some speculative hype on popular themes, some investors see prices doubling or even multiplying several times in the short term and become deeply involved, continuously increasing their holdings, hoping to be the last winner. However, the market will not remain bullish forever; when the bubble bursts and prices plummet, these greed-driven investors often suffer heavy losses. Greed robs them of their ability to analyze and make decisions rationally, turning them into &amp;ldquo;gamblers&amp;rdquo; in the stock market rather than wise investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fear-shackles-that-bind-your-hands-and-feet&#34;&gt;Fear: Shackles that bind your hands and feet
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear is the opposite of greed. Fear is equally destructive in the stock market. When market conditions turn sharply downward and stock prices fall significantly, investors are easily caught up in panic. This fear causes them to lose confidence in the market, and even if they hold fundamentally sound stocks, they rush to sell at a loss out of fear of further losses. For example, during the global financial crisis, the share prices of many high-quality blue-chip stocks also fell sharply with the broader market. Some investors were overwhelmed by fear, failing to see the long-term value of these companies and selling their shares at extremely low prices, resulting in missed opportunities for substantial returns from subsequent market rebounds and company performance growth. Fear not only causes investors to suffer losses in the short term but can also leave them with a lasting psychological shadow, making them hesitant to re-enter the market and thus missing out on investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blindly-following-trends-a-fog-that-obscures-direction&#34;&gt;Blindly following trends: A &amp;ldquo;fog&amp;rdquo; that obscures direction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stock trading and wealth management, blindly following the crowd is another psychological trap that investors easily fall into. In this era of information explosion, various investment suggestions, market rumors, and hot news abound. Many investors lack independent thinking and judgment skills, blindly following others&amp;rsquo; actions. They see those around them making money by buying a certain stock and impulsively follow suit; they hear so-called &amp;ldquo;insider information&amp;rdquo; and invest all their savings. This blind following behavior ignores the research and analysis of the stocks themselves, leaving investors like ships lost in fog, losing their direction. For example, some concept stocks can indeed bring short-term gains to those who follow the trend at the beginning of market hype, but as the hype fades, the stock price plummets, and those who are uninformed and blindly following become &amp;ldquo;catchers&amp;rdquo; (those who buy after a decline). They fail to realize that each investor has different risk tolerance, investment goals, and investment horizons; an investment strategy suitable for others may not be suitable for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overconfidence-a-hidden-shoal&#34;&gt;Overconfidence: A Hidden &amp;ldquo;Shoal&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overconfidence is also a problem that cannot be ignored in the mindset of stock trading and wealth management. Some investors, after achieving several investment successes, begin to become inflated with pride, believing they have mastered the laws of the market and can accurately predict stock price movements. They ignore the complexity and uncertainty of the market, overtrade, blindly expand their investments, and even use high leverage for speculation. However, the market is unpredictable, and investors who are overly confident often suffer heavy losses in an unexpected market fluctuation. For example, some inexperienced but initially successful investors believe they have professional investment capabilities and begin to frequently buy and sell stocks, constantly increasing their investment amounts. When systemic risks appear or individual stocks experience sudden negative news, they fail to stop their losses in time due to overconfidence, leading to a significant reduction in capital. Overconfidence is like hidden reefs beneath the surface of the sea—seemingly calm and harmless, but capable of causing an investor&amp;rsquo;s ship of fortune to run aground and sink unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-adjust-your-mindset-and-invest-steadily&#34;&gt;How to adjust your mindset and invest steadily
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a correct investment philosophy: Investors should understand that stock trading and wealth management are for achieving long-term, stable asset appreciation, not getting rich quick. By learning about investment knowledge, understanding market rules, and establishing the principles of value investing and long-term investing, investors can avoid being swayed by short-term gains and market sentiment. For example, thoroughly research a company&amp;rsquo;s fundamentals, focusing on factors such as its profitability, industry position, and management team, to select stocks with long-term investment value rather than blindly chasing short-term trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a sound investment plan: Based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals, formulate a scientific and reasonable investment plan. Clearly define key elements such as investment amount, investment horizon, expected return, and stop-loss point, and strictly adhere to the plan. This can help avoid impulsive decisions driven by emotional fluctuations during the investment process. For example, limit the investment proportion of each stock to a certain percentage of your total assets, take profits when the price rises to meet your expected return, and cut losses decisively when it reaches the stop-loss point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control your emotions and stay calm: When facing market fluctuations, learn to control your emotions and remain calm and rational. You can relieve investment pressure through methods such as diverting attention, exercising, and communicating with others, avoiding negative emotional influences on investment decisions. When the market experiences significant volatility, first calmly analyze the reasons, combine your own investment strategy and stock fundamentals, and make a rational judgment instead of blindly following the trend or panicking to sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous learning and reflection: The stock market is constantly evolving, so investors need to continuously learn new investment knowledge and skills, pay attention to macroeconomic conditions, industry trends, and company information, and constantly improve their investment level. At the same time, they should regularly reflect on their own investment behavior, summarize experiences and lessons, identify problems in mindset and decision-making, and make timely adjustments and improvements. For example, after each investment, review the entire investment process, analyze the reasons for success and failure, and think about how to avoid similar mistakes in future investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in stocks and managing finances is a long and challenging journey, where mindset plays a crucial role. Only by maintaining a rational, calm, humble, and independent thinking approach can investors navigate the ups and downs of the stock market steadily and achieve wealth preservation and appreciation. Investors should regard cultivating their mindset as a mandatory course in the investment process, using a positive attitude to steer their financial ship and ensure long-term success on the path of stock investing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Increased scrutiny of third-party investment advisors; reckoning for those behind TikTok stock trading</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/third-party-wealth-managers-scrutiny-tiktok-stock-winners-crackdown/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 02:59:18 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/third-party-wealth-managers-scrutiny-tiktok-stock-winners-crackdown/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The sledgehammer is falling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokerage services, boosted by short videos, are likely entering a fast track&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late September of this year, after a period of strong performance in the A-share market, Douyin stock recommendations received attention from various parties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several financial news anchors, including &amp;ldquo;Da Lan,&amp;rdquo; have gained popularity on Douyin, indirectly causing some volatility in the capital market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of popular financial news anchors also shouldn&amp;rsquo;t overlook the power behind them – third-party wealth management firms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to sources, many third-party investment advisory firms operate multiple accounts on short video platforms, using traffic allocation to attract users to watch investment education videos and boost their enthusiasm for purchasing related investment advisory products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors also suggest that a certain third-party investment advisory firm earned 1 billion yuan in revenue this October alone, exceeding its income for the entire first half of the year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &amp;ldquo;good times&amp;rdquo; are facing more uncertainties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since November, various departments have issued documents requiring securities service institutions to strengthen compliance management of their social media accounts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of November 15th, Tonghua Shun (300033.SZ) announced that its subsidiary was penalized by the China Securities Regulatory Commission due to live streaming activities involving implied stock recommendations and other behaviors
This could be signaling that regulators are tightening their oversight of the market
The promotion of services by third-party investment advisory firms, including Nine Square Wisdom Investment (9636.HK), may also face increased pressure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strictly-monitored-and-watched-closely&#34;&gt;Strictly monitored and watched closely
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of short video platforms like Douyin has amplified emotional voices and indirectly influenced trading behavior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data from Jiali Digital, during the period of September 27th to October 8th, when transaction volume reached a new high, Douyin&amp;rsquo;s A-share keyword search index soared from 4.2384 million to 12.7786 million, more than doubling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under these circumstances, the actions of third-party investment advisory firms that are &amp;ldquo;adding fuel to the fire&amp;rdquo; are attracting the attention of regulatory authorities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokerage employees recommending individual stocks through live streams is a frequent violation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 8th, the Guangdong Securities Regulatory Bureau took regulatory measures to suspend the acceptance of new clients from a certain company due to instances such as &amp;ldquo;implying stock recommendations&amp;rdquo; in their live broadcasts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the evening of November 14th, the Guangdong Securities and Futures Industry Association issued a document titled &amp;ldquo;Inadequate Live Stream Control, Institutions to be Suspended,&amp;rdquo; directly pointing out that some institutions with securities consulting qualifications had inadequate control during live stream promotional activities and engaged in recommending individual stocks during broadcasts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live stock recommendations are prohibited. Live streaming falls under public media dissemination, and live streamers, regardless of whether they are registered as securities investment advisors, are not permitted to recommend individual stocks during broadcasts. This was stated by the Guangdong Securities Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an isolated case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, the Shanghai Securities Regulatory Bureau’s penalty notice also included a case involving illegal stock recommendations on social media platforms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to regulatory investigation, Wang Yong, an investment consultant at the Shanghai branch of Haisun Securities Investment Consulting Co., Ltd., published misleading video content through WeChat Video Number, which violated professional conduct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Securities Regulatory Bureau took supervisory management measures of issuing a warning letter to Wang Yong regarding this matter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to information obtained by Feng (ID: TradeWind01), some investment advisor firms that do not meet the qualifications have been recommending stocks on Douyin through brokerage affiliations and have now been suspended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some people in the industry are doing live streams on Douyin, but they’re actually affiliated with brokerages, which gives them investment consultant qualifications. Then they use online live streams to attract customers and sell investment consultant combination products offline.” A wealth manager from South China told Xin Feng (ID: TradeWind01), “But later, because they were recommending stocks during the live stream, it was discovered, so they were suspended. Reputable brokerages generally have educational live streams that discuss sector conditions but don’t involve individual stocks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, regulators are paying close attention to illegal stock recommendations on social media&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Shenzhen Securities Regulatory Bureau recently notified that individual institutions or individuals within the industry have been found to be engaging in illegal stock recommendations and other violations through self-media. To further regulate the operation and management of securities investment consulting agencies&amp;rsquo; self-media within its jurisdiction, each agency should strengthen the management of their own self-media operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may bring more challenges to the promotion of various third-party wealth management service providers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;traffic-businesses-are-illegal&#34;&gt;Traffic businesses are illegal
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether investors lured into the market by short videos have made money remains to be seen, but as &amp;ldquo;water sellers,&amp;rdquo; third-party investment advisory firms have already seen their value rise in the secondary market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a leading player in online investment education, Jiufang Intelligent Investment&amp;rsquo;s market capitalization has surged from 287.8 million yuan in early September to 1.2464 billion yuan at the close of trading on November 13th, representing an increase of 333.08% over 49 trading days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The semi-annual report shows that in the first half of this year, Jiufang Zhi Tou conducted brand exposure on social media platforms such as Douyin and Xiaohongshu, reaching 488 accounts and 0.46 billion followers by the end of June this year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, as the chief investment consultant of Jiufang Zhito, &amp;ldquo;Hong Bangzhu&amp;rdquo; has 2.26 million followers on Douyin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are deeply engaged in MCN operations, focusing on users and collaboratively driving the comprehensive development of traffic, brands, and products. Jiufang Zhi投 (Jiufang Investment) pointed out that &amp;ldquo;By deeply integrating new media tools such as live streaming and short videos, leveraging AI technology to build fan networks, and actively exploring e-commerce models, we can effectively achieve efficient conversion of traffic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiufang Zhitou&amp;rsquo;s consultant courses cover a range of prices from several thousand yuan to over 130,000 yuan. The most expensive package, Super Investor, is priced at 139,600 yuan/six months and includes exclusive insights and private consultant services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, JIAF’s investment consultant products have a refund rate of over 10%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first half of 2024, the refund rates for Jiu Fang Zhi Tou&amp;rsquo;s flagship series and Jiu Fang Zhi Tou’s Qinlong series reached 14.7% and 18.5%, respectively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Jiufang Zhitu’s business development will be affected remains to be seen amid regulatory scrutiny&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent media reports indicate that accounts under third-party investment advisory firms such as Jiufang Zhi Tou have been affected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 7th, media reported that &amp;ldquo;Hong Gangzhu&amp;rdquo; had been suspended from streaming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on November 15th in the afternoon, Xin Feng (ID: TradeWind01) searched for the account and found that the livestream appointment for November 18th was still available on the &amp;ldquo;Hong Gangzhu&amp;rdquo; livestreaming interface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market news also indicates that relevant authorities have inspected Jufang Intelligence Investment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But individuals close to Nine Square Intelligence have told TradeWind (ID:TradeWind01) that the inspection is a routine check and has concluded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only company rumored to be caught up in this round of regulatory storm recently&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports indicate that Tonghua Shun is being investigated for allegedly illegally recommending stocks, and business operations may be suspended
In response, Tonghuashun stated on November 15th that &amp;ldquo;there is no illegal stock recommendation situation and there has been no investigation.&amp;rdquo;
However, that same evening, Tonghua Shun announced that its subsidiary, Zhejiang Tonghuashun Cloud Software Co., Ltd., was penalized by the Zhejiang Securities Regulatory Bureau with a suspension of acquiring new customers for three months and other penalties due to inadequate compliance management during the promotion of its live streaming business and instances of implying stock recommendations
Behind this, it may also mean that regulatory authorities&amp;rsquo; attention on promotional stock content on social media platforms like Douyin Live is being further upgraded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the short video market is also attracting many brokerages, but they are currently still cautious due to regulatory requirements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person from a securities firm told Xin Feng (ID: TradeWind01) that the company is exploring short video operations and methods for attracting traffic, and has also organized personnel to visit short video platform companies for learning. However, due to compliance requirements, it is still in the exploratory phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the various compliance requirements of regulation stem from the evident emotional coloring of content on short video platforms, but investment requires market participants to maintain rationality; the two are inherently in conflict&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If emotions influence the capital market, it can easily lead to sharp market fluctuations, which is contrary to the long-term healthy development of the capital market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How securities firms should embrace the arrival of the short video era while avoiding regulatory breaches is a difficult question for all parties involved&lt;/p&gt;</description>
