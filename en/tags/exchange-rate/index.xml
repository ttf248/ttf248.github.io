        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the foreign exchange market, especially at banks or currency exchange points, we often see terms like &amp;ldquo;buy rate&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sell rate.&amp;rdquo; Many people may not be clear about these two concepts, or even confused. Today, let&amp;rsquo;s use a simple example to help everyone understand the meaning and function of these two rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-buy-exchange-rate-and-sell-exchange-rate&#34;&gt;What are &amp;ldquo;buy exchange rate&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sell exchange rate&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buy rate is the exchange rate at which a bank or currency exchange institution is willing to purchase foreign currency; that is, when you sell foreign currency (such as US dollars) to a bank, the bank will pay you in RMB according to the buy rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selling exchange rate is the rate at which a bank or currency exchange institution is willing to sell foreign currency; that is, when you buy foreign currency with Chinese Yuan, the bank will sell it to you at the selling exchange rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The buy exchange rate is the price at which a bank buys foreign currency from you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling exchange rate: The price the bank offers you for foreign currency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that banks&amp;rsquo; buying and selling exchange rates are usually different, with the selling rate generally higher than the buying rate. This difference is the bank’s source of profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-study-analysis&#34;&gt;Case Study Analysis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help everyone better understand the practical application of these two exchange rates, let&amp;rsquo;s take a specific example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you go to the bank to exchange for US dollars, and the exchange rate offered by the bank is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy exchange rate: 1 US dollar = 7.0 Chinese yuan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling exchange rate: 1 US dollar = 7.2 Chinese yuan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-1-you-sell-us-dollars-to-the-bank&#34;&gt;Scenario 1: You sell US dollars to the bank
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have $1,000 and want to sell it to a bank; the bank will calculate based on its buying exchange rate&lt;/p&gt;
\[
$1000 x 7.0 yuan/dollar = 7000 yuan
\]
&lt;p&gt;That means the bank will give you 7,000 RMB. The exchange rate here is a &lt;strong&gt;buy rate&lt;/strong&gt;, because you are selling dollars to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-2-you-buy-us-dollars-with-rmb&#34;&gt;Scenario 2: You buy US dollars with RMB
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have 7,000 RMB and want to exchange it for US dollars. The bank will calculate based on the selling exchange rate:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
$7,000 yuan ÷ 7.2 yuan/dollar = $972.22
\]
&lt;p&gt;In this case, you can exchange 7000 Chinese Yuan for approximately 972.22 US dollars. The exchange rate here is a &lt;strong&gt;selling rate&lt;/strong&gt;, as you are buying US dollars from the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-the-buying-exchange-rate-different-from-the-selling-exchange-rate&#34;&gt;Why is the buying exchange rate different from the selling exchange rate?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that the bank&amp;rsquo;s buying exchange rate (7.0 RMB/USD) is lower than its selling exchange rate (7.2 RMB/USD). This is because banks typically profit from foreign exchange transactions by using this difference in rates. In other words, banks make a profit by charging a higher selling exchange rate and paying a lower buying exchange rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the above case, the bank&amp;rsquo;s spread is:&lt;/p&gt;
\[
Selling exchange rate (7.2) - Buying exchange rate (7.0) = 0.2 RMB
\]
&lt;p&gt;This difference is the bank&amp;rsquo;s source of profit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy exchange rate: The bank buys foreign currency from you at this rate (the rate at which you sell foreign currency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling exchange rate: This is the exchange rate at which the bank sells foreign currency to you (the exchange rate when you buy foreign currency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between the buying and selling exchange rates is the bank&amp;rsquo;s profit margin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understand these exchange rate concepts, you can more clearly know how much foreign currency you will receive when exchanging currencies, or how much Chinese Yuan (RMB) you need to spend to buy foreign currency. I hope this simple example helps everyone better understand the basic principles of foreign exchange rates!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Renminbi exchange rate has experienced significant volatility, breaking through 7.26</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/renminbi-exchange-rate-volatility/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 00:31:13 +0800</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/renminbi-exchange-rate-volatility/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fluctuations in the Renminbi exchange rate and the decline of the broader market may be related to the actions of global central banks, the unexpected interest rate cut by the Swiss National Bank, the performance of US economic data, and adjustments in market expectations regarding inflation and interest rate cuts. These factors collectively impacted the foreign exchange market and stock market, leading to volatility in the Renminbi exchange rate and a decline in A-share markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the content of the link you provided, on March 22, 2024, the exchange rate of the Renminbi experienced a significant fluctuation. Here are the details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US dollar exchange rate against the offshore renminbi broke through: The yuan weakened at the opening of the day, with the dollar versus the offshore renminbi rising above 7.24 to 7.24926 and rising above 7.22 to 7.22360 against the onshore renminbi during intraday trading, both breaking through highs since November 17, 2023. As of the time this reporter from Caiyun Society reported, the dollar versus the offshore renminbi broke through the 7.26 level, falling to a low of 7.2639, and the trend has not stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PBOC Midpoint Adjustment: On March 22, the central bank announced that the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar was set at 7.1004, down 62 basis points, with a larger adjustment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The A-share market reacted with a decline, influenced by various factors; all three major indices opened and closed lower, with falls exceeding 1%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons for Forex Market Volatility: A senior currency trader from an investment firm in Hong Kong stated that forex market volatility is primarily due to the US dollar being boosted by the Swiss National Bank&amp;rsquo;s unexpected interest rate cut, combined with a strong US economy and persistent inflation which may delay interest rate cuts, leading to an increase in the US Dollar Index&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Central Bank Updates:&lt;/strong&gt; This week is a &amp;ldquo;super central bank week&amp;rdquo; for global markets, as central banks in the United States, Japan, the UK, Australia, and many other countries will announce interest rate decisions this week. The Swiss National Bank unexpectedly announced an interest rate cut, becoming the first G10 central bank to do so since the outbreak of the pandemic, which disrupted market equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guangda Bank&amp;rsquo;s Financial Markets Research Department researcher Zhou Maohua stated that, although the renminbi has experienced some fluctuations recently, the overall magnitude is significantly smaller than that of major currencies such as the US dollar. Short-term volatility will not change the year’s trend of a steady and upward trajectory for the renminbi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>US-China trade war</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-china-trade-war/</link>

        <guid>https://ttf248.life/en/p/us-china-trade-war/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a tangent, the differences between socialism with Chinese characteristics and capitalism. From the older generation, I’ve heard that to get rich, you must first build roads. Infrastructure construction in China is funded by the state; in a capitalist society, these would be contracted out. In remote areas, there are no profits to be made, so companies wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be willing to take on the work. Talking too much will stray from the current article’s theme. Ordinary people may feel that the trade war has little impact on their lives, but in reality, China’s high-end manufacturing has always been relatively weak. In the IT industry I work in, memory, hard drives, CPUs, and graphics cards – the core components of assembling a computer – all come from foreign factories. The cost of these parts accounts for 50% of the total price of the machine. High-end manufacturing is imperative. The collision between China and the United States is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reference-materials&#34;&gt;Reference materials
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Sino-American trade war that began in 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made in China 2025&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wikipedia&#34;&gt;Wikipedia
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sino-American trade war, also known as the China–United States trade war, or more briefly as the Sino-US trade dispute, Sino-US trade friction, Sino-US trade quarrel, or US-China trade war, is a trade war between the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China and the United States of America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade dispute originated when U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on March 22, 2018, claiming that &amp;ldquo;China steals American intellectual property and business secrets,&amp;rdquo; and directed the United States Trade Representative to impose tariffs on goods imported from China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, involving an estimated total value of $60 billion. On July 6, 2018, the U.S. imposed a 25% additional tariff on Chinese exports worth $340 billion. The Ministry of Commerce of China responded with retaliatory measures on the same day, imposing a 25% additional tariff on U.S. exports to China worth $340 billion, including soybeans, one of the most exported products from the United States to China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US and China had previously reached a consensus in May 2018 to suspend the trade war and issued a joint statement seeking resolution. However, the Office of the United States Trade Representative subsequently announced on June 16th a first batch of tariffs targeting $500 billion worth of Chinese goods entering the US, raising the original 10% tariff rate to 25%. In response, the State Council Tariff Commission of China retaliated with equivalent measures, and the Ministry of Commerce also resumed anti-dumping investigations on multiple US products. On July 6th, the Trump administration formally imposed a 25% tariff on $340 billion worth of Chinese goods in the first batch of tariffs, marking the formal implementation of Trump&amp;rsquo;s China tariff policy (the remaining $160 billion was subsequently subject to a 25% tariff on August 23rd). The Ministry of Commerce later stated in a statement that &amp;ldquo;The United States violated WTO rules and launched the largest trade war in economic history.&amp;rdquo; Customs authorities said that China’s countermeasures had been implemented immediately after the US tariffs took effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 1, at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, leaders Xi Jinping and Donald Trump reached a consensus to conduct 90-day negotiations and suspend new trade measures during the negotiation period. After the deadline of March 1, 2019, the United States announced significant progress and extended the suspension of new trade measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs of 25% on Chinese goods entering the United States valued at approximately $200 billion, bringing the total subject to tariffs to $250 billion. The measure took effect on June 1 for Chinese products arriving at U.S. ports. On May 13, the State Council Tariff Commission of China announced that it would raise tariffs by 5% to 25% on certain imports from the United States valued at $60 billion, effective June 1. On June 1, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced a postponement of the U.S. tariff increase to June 15, while the State Council Tariff Commission of China stated that China’s retaliatory tariffs would take effect as scheduled on June 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 29, the leaders of the two countries, Xi Jinping and Donald Trump, held talks at the G20 Osaka Summit, agreeing to restart trade consultations and for the United States not to impose new tariffs on Chinese products&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 1, due to the Trump administration&amp;rsquo;s dissatisfaction with the progress of China’s purchases of U.S. agricultural products, Trump announced on Twitter that starting September 1, 2019, a 10% tariff would be imposed on all remaining Chinese goods exported to the United States valued at $300 billion. On August 5, the exchange rate of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar fell below the 7 threshold. On the same day, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it was designating China as a currency manipulator. Subsequently, the Chinese government announced a suspension of purchases of U.S. agricultural products and on August 24 announced tariffs of 10% or 5% on approximately $750 billion worth of U.S. goods, and resumed tariffs on U.S. automobiles and their parts; in response, the United States increased the tariff rate previously imposed on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods to 15%, and raised the current 25% tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30%, but this was later put on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 16, 2020, China and the United States signed the Phase One trade agreement&lt;/p&gt;</description>
