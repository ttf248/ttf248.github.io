        <title>Fees have been reduced, fees have been reduced – several large domestic ETFs have lowered their fees</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Huatai Pioneer has lowered the all-in fee rate for its CSI 300 ETF and similar products to the lowest tier among comparable ETFs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better meet the investment and financial management needs of investors, Huatai-Perrin Fund announced adjustments to the management fees and custody fees for its Huatai-Perrin CSI 300 ETF and related funds, revising relevant content in the fund contracts accordingly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please provide the Chinese text you want me to translate. I am ready when you are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading ETFs including ChinaAMC Huaxia Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 ETF, ChinaAMC CSI 50 ETF, NanShan Zhongxin 500 ETF, JIA SHI Huaxia Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 ETF, and Yifangda Growth Enterprise ETF have simultaneously announced reductions in management and custody fees, bringing rates down to 0.15% and 0.05%, respectively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most previous ETF fee reductions, this one was driven by proactive moves from large-scale products, and will likely have a significant impact on the industry. Exchange data shows that as of November 18th, the ChinaAMC Huatai 300 ETF has exceeded 370 billion yuan, making it the largest ETF currently available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of super ETFs has begun reducing fees, demonstrating a willingness to benefit investors and allowing them to invest in popular, liquid funds with higher value for money&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry experts believe that fee reductions for ETFs with economies of scale will help mutual funds fulfill their function of serving inclusive finance, benefiting a wider range of investors by reducing holding costs, increasing potential returns, and enhancing investment satisfaction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low fees also help enhance the product&amp;rsquo;s competitiveness. With liquidity attraction and cost advantages, it is expected to attract more long-term incremental capital, fostering a healthy &amp;ldquo;long money, long investment&amp;rdquo; ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, broad-based ETFs have become a primary channel for investors seeking entry with modest capital and long-term investment, thanks to their advantages such as flexible trading, high transparency, strong liquidity, and low investment thresholds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fee reduction could act as a catalyst, facilitating greater participation from long-term investors in A-shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My fixed-investment Tianhong fund hasn&amp;rsquo;t released an announcement yet, but it should follow suit. If there’s no update, I’ll need to consider switching funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original management fee was 0.5%, and the custody fee was 0.1%. The new fees are 0.15% for management, and 0.05% for custody. This is still a significant reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Fund and fixed income wealth management</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of us born in the 90s, we didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel the impact of the 2008 financial crisis because we were young and not yet focused on investing. The bull market of 2015 was dramatic, with a significant correction before government intervention stabilized it. This brought the concept of investment funds into the view of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ant-financial-and-alipay&#34;&gt;Ant Financial and Alipay
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alipay, as a natural traffic entry point under Ant Group, was initially positioned as a payment tool. Most people chose Alipay for buying funds compared to WeChat. Alipay successfully transformed fund sales into ordinary shopping. The bull market starting in 2019 and the mutual support among fund managers were ultimately driven by pandemic-induced monetary easing. Those who entered (the market) profited, while those who watched became envious and rushed to enter. The speed at which new funds surpass 10 billion yuan is accelerating. With even older generations now buying funds, trillion-dollar funds are within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the rise of Ant Group&amp;rsquo;s internet-based fund sales platform, ordinary people typically encountered fund sales only when depositing money at banks, where branch managers would enthusiastically promote various financial products. The packaging and promotional information on the internet, along with the exorbitant advertising fees paid by fund sales institutions, have made Alipay’s fund advertisements completely detached from reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provided growth data only shows the returns for the past three years on the table, and only the annualized average return for legacy funds. Why don&amp;rsquo;t they publish the annual average return separately? Is it difficult to calculate? No, it’s because the data is unfavorable and doesn&amp;rsquo;t easily encourage customers to buy the fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fixed-income-investments&#34;&gt;Fixed income investments
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has not yet entered the era of negative interest rates. Bank deposits and government bonds are the most reliable fixed-income products; pure bond funds are also a good option. You can easily find China&amp;rsquo;s average salary by checking data released by local statistical bureaus. Here’s a simple scenario: with 2 million yuan in assets, an annualized return of 4% would generate annual income exceeding the average salary in most cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s largely based on my personal experiences, and there’s a lot I could write. If you want to learn more, I recommend reading books on economics; don&amp;rsquo;t blindly follow trends. For ordinary families, the core of financial management is preservation of value, not chasing get-rich-quick schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle often says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing the right thing at the right time yields the greatest value. Studying diligently and obtaining a good education is better than earning pocket money distributing flyers. Working hard after graduation brings substantial returns in salary increases. When starting a family, learn to care for your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
