        <description>&lt;p&gt;Huatai Pioneer’s CSI 300 ETF and related announcements have lowered the comprehensive fee rate to the lowest tier among its peers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 19th, China Tai Ping Fund announced that to better meet the investment and financial management needs of a wide range of investors, starting from November 22nd, it will adjust the management fees and custody fees for China Tai Ping Huatai Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 ETF and its linked funds, and revise relevant content in the corresponding fund contracts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjustments, the annual management fee for China Tai Ping Prudential Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 ETF and its linked funds has been reduced to 0.15%, and the annual custody fee has been reduced to 0.05%, both adjusted to the lowest tier of fees for index funds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost simultaneously, leading ETFs in the industry such as ChinaAMC CSI 300 ETF, ChinaAMC SSE 50 ETF, NFAT Zhongcai 500 ETF, JIA SHI CSI 300 ETF, and Yifangda Growth Enterprise ETF also announced reductions in management fees and custody fees, with rates all lowered to 0.15% and 0.05%, respectively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most ETF fee reductions in the past, this one was driven by proactive action from a product with scale advantages within the market, and will have a greater impact on the industry going forward. Exchange data shows that as of November 18th, the size of Caitong B&amp;amp;R CSI 300 ETF exceeded 370 billion yuan, making it the largest ETF in the current market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest group of super ETFs has taken the lead in reducing fees, demonstrating a willingness to benefit investors and allowing them to invest in popular and liquid funds with higher value for money&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry experts believe that fee reductions for ETFs with economies of scale will, on the one hand, help to fulfill the role of mutual funds in providing inclusive financial services, benefiting a wider range of investors by reducing holding costs, increasing potential returns, and enhancing their investment experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, low fees also help to further enhance the competitiveness of the product itself. With the support of liquidity absorption and cost operation advantages, the product is expected to attract more long-term incremental capital into the market, helping to build a good ecosystem for &amp;ldquo;long money, long investment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, thanks to its unique advantages such as flexible trading, high transparency, strong liquidity, and low investment threshold, broad-based ETFs have become a primary channel for investors entering the market with modest capital and pursuing long-term investments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This price reduction could become a sort of &amp;ldquo;accelerator,&amp;rdquo; making it easier for large investors to enter the A-share market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fixed-investment fund I chose, Tianhong Fund, hasn&amp;rsquo;t released an announcement yet, but it should follow suit. If there’s no update, I’ll have to consider switching funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original management fee: 0.5%, custody fee: 0.1%. New management fee: 0.15%, custody fee: 0.05%. This is still a significant reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Fund and fixed income wealth management</title>
        <link>https://ttf248.life/en/p/fund-and-fixed-income-wealth-management/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We, those of us born in the 90s, didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel much about the financial crisis of 2008, because we were young and not yet at the age of investing. The bull market in 2015 was grand and spectacular, and its decline was equally dramatic, ultimately requiring intervention from the government to save the market. At the same time, it brought the concept of funds into the view of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ant-financial-and-alipay&#34;&gt;Ant Financial and Alipay
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alipay, as a natural traffic entry point under Ant Group, was positioned as a payment tool from its inception. When it comes to buying funds, most people chose Alipay over WeChat. Alipay successfully transformed fund sales into ordinary shopping. The bull market that started in 2019 and the mutual warming among fund managers were ultimately driven by the monetary easing guided by the pandemic. Those who entered (the market) made money, and those who watched from the sidelines became envious and rushed to enter. The speed at which new funds are breaking through the billion-dollar mark is accelerating. With &amp;ldquo;aunties&amp;rdquo; now starting to buy funds, trillion-dollar funds are not far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the booming popularity of Ant Financial&amp;rsquo;s internet-based fund sales platform, ordinary people typically encountered fund sales only when depositing money at banks, where branch managers would enthusiastically introduce various financial products. The packaging and promotional information on the internet, along with the exorbitant advertising fees paid by fund sales institutions, have made Alipay’s fund advertisements completely detached from reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal bank fixed-term wealth management yields 4%, P2P wealth management, which was popular a few years ago, yielded 8%, and credit card interest rates are 12%. Our protagonist, the fund promoted by Alipay, yields 150% and 250% when the market goes up, making everyone happy. But what about when the market goes down? Alipay is playing with fire. The growth data provided only shows the returns for the past three years on the surface, and established funds only show annualized average returns. Why don&amp;rsquo;t they dare to write out the average annual return each year? Is it because it’s difficult to calculate? The answer is no; it’s because the data isn’t good-looking and doesn’t easily guide customers to buy funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fixed-income-wealth-management&#34;&gt;Fixed income wealth management
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;China hasn&amp;rsquo;t entered the era of negative interest rates yet; bank deposits and government bonds are the most secure fixed-income products. Pure bond funds are also good options. You can easily find China’s average salary by checking data released by local statistical bureaus. The author describes a simple scenario: an asset size of 2 million yuan, with an annualized return of 4%, resulting in annual earnings that exceed the average salary in most cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;afterword&#34;&gt;Afterword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s mostly based on my personal experiences, there’s a lot I could write about. If you want to learn more, I recommend reading books on economics; don’t blindly follow anyone. For ordinary families, the core of financial management is preservation of value, not chasing dreams of getting rich quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My uncle often says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing the right thing at the right time yields the greatest value; studying diligently and obtaining a good education is better than earning pocket money by distributing flyers; working hard when you first graduate can bring substantial returns in salary increases; when starting a family, learn to take care of your home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those interested can take a look at this speech: Regarding time, you need to read many books to find the answer. The text transcript is available on this site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
