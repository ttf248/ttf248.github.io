        <description>&lt;p&gt;A method for disrupting systems, used for system stability testing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The domestic internet industry always likes to come up with something new, sometimes you hear a term and most people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know what it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading some articles, I still find this definition of chaos engineering in its early stages relatively easy to accept&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early explorations of Chaos Engineering have actually existed within the industry all along, previously appearing as fault testing and disaster recovery drills. However, with the continuous development of microservice architectures and the increasing complexity of distributed systems, Chaos Engineering has begun to emerge and gain increasing attention. After Netflix formally proposed the concept of Chaos Engineering, related theories began to rapidly enrich. Netflix&amp;rsquo;s practices have also proven the immense significance of Chaos Engineering in the field of stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
