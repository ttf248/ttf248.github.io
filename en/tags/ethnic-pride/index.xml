        <description>&lt;p&gt;For Chinese people, watching movies has become an essential entertainment during the Spring Festival season when families reunite. This year&amp;rsquo;s Spring Festival film releases were dominated by &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha,&amp;rdquo; which was incredibly popular and sparked widespread discussion. The buzz surrounding it is reminiscent of “Wolf Warrior,” both films carrying a strong patriotic theme that evokes a sense of national pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unexpected success of &amp;ldquo;Nezha&amp;rdquo; during the Spring Festival season, sparking a sense of national pride reminiscent of films like &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior,&amp;rdquo; demonstrates a patriotic theme. While acknowledging significant progress, the film isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as impressive as some claim. As a gamer, I find many aspects feel overly slick and the fight scenes lean heavily towards an MMO style. Numerous reports indicate people buying tickets to see it but ultimately not going due to its performance pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fight-scenes-lack-texture&#34;&gt;The fight scenes lack texture
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a gamer, I usually spend my days immersed in online games and didn&amp;rsquo;t have high expectations for movies. But the buzz around &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; was undeniable; everyone was talking about it, so I figured I’d check it out. Once I entered the theater and saw the visuals, I felt a jolt. While the production quality has improved considerably, some scenes looked a bit greasy. And the fight sequences? They were too heavily influenced by online game aesthetics. Having played games for so long, this visual style is too similar to certain in-game environments, lacking the texture one expects from a film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;crazy-movie-fans&#34;&gt;Crazy movie fans
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing the movie, I checked online and saw that quite a few people bought tickets for &amp;ldquo;The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Child&amp;rdquo; but didn&amp;rsquo;t actually watch it, all to boost its box office. That’s impressive dedication – clearly, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of enthusiasm for this film, and everyone wants to do something to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plot&#34;&gt;Plot
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s recall &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; when Wu Jing shouted, “Whoever dares offend China will be punished no matter how far away they are,” many people were thrilled and felt that our Chinese military was so powerful, and our country so strong. While &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; doesn’t have such direct patriotic slogans, it vividly showcases traditional Chinese culture. We grew up listening to the stories of mythological figures like Nezha and Ao Bing; the film portrays their conflicts, love, and growth with depth and emotion – isn&amp;rsquo;t that the charm of Chinese culture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Nezha. Misunderstood and looked down upon since childhood, yet he refused to give in, declaring &amp;ldquo;My fate is my own, not the heavens&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo; That spirit is so much like the resilience ingrained in us Chinese people. No matter how great the difficulty, we don’t back down, but strive to change our destiny through effort. Ao Bing also exemplifies this – burdened by a family mission, seemingly cold but truly kind-hearted, willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. We often see such friendship and responsibility in real life, don&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advancement-of-animated-films&#34;&gt;Advancement of animated films
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &amp;ldquo;The Devils Who Laugh&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, it effectively combines traditional Chinese culture with modern film technology, showcasing the progress of Chinese animation. Just as &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; demonstrated a breakthrough for Chinese cinema in action films, this kind of advancement gives us hope that Chinese movies can shine on the international stage and allow foreigners to appreciate the brilliance of Chinese culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chinese people, wherever we go, we carry our nation and culture in our hearts. Films like &amp;ldquo;Ne Zha&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Wolf Warrior&amp;rdquo; are like keys, unlocking a sense of national pride deep within us. They allow us to experience the strength of our country and the charm of our culture amidst laughter and joy, inspiring us to work hard in our respective fields and contribute to the prosperity and development of our nation. This is likely why these films have become so popular and resonate with such strong feelings of national pride. We hope for more films like this in the future, to keep this sense of pride brimming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
